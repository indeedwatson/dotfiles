2015-08-13 17:10:49	sky3	as the extension was .*pdf so , Jordan_U i thought its a .pdf file

2015-08-13 17:15:02	bitlord	sky3, you can do a simple test if you have any tool to create a pdf document, easiest way is to use libreoffice writer for example, and later use that pdf +pdftotext to get text from it

One idea would be to set up network bridging on your physical server, create a virtual machine and image with centOS, set up a samba share of the vids directly to the Virt, and spin up apache on the virt and host from it like it was just another computer in your closet.

If not in any of there mentioned places, find an RPM, find a yum/dnf repo the author has provided. If no rpm, look for srpm, and consider building it with mock. If no rpm spec, look for sources. Build from source..

2015-11-23 20:41:32	nda_	Mmh. Seems to me that it should be possible to keep multiple versions of a library side-by-side.. Then again, they may depend on libraries that are incompatible with the OS version.. Maybe, I don't know how it works.

2015-11-23 20:42:16	mutk	nda_,  RPM is a mechanism to help enforce dependency, and to provide a build/deploy mechanism. It does not resolve deps. yum, and dnf  with the repo metadata is where dep resolution happens.  An rpm should have correctly define versions of the libs it needs for example. If that 'legacy' RPM is in a properly built repository for yum or dnf, a client can install it and the dependent libs should be pulled in

Most binaries have a dynamically loaded library or two. Those libs are located in different places on different distros. One binary built for mint is not necessarily going to run in Fedora.

2015-12-03 14:18:48	@Southern_Gentlem	tytan,  after all all those distros are downstream for fedora
2015-12-03 14:19:31	tytan	Southern_Gentlem: I haven't noticed selinux in Debian based distros yet. I'm getting curious about it.
2015-12-03 14:19:49	badbodh	amnix, well. the trick is to basically force vsync. so cpu load is to be expected. unless you have an antique PC shouldn;t be a problem.
2015-12-03 14:21:07	badbodh	i never got lag issues like you mention. you can remove the 20-intel.conf, reboot and check if tearing starts.
2015-12-03 14:21:18	@Southern_Gentlem	tytan, and debian isnt downstream for fedora now is it
2015-12-03 14:21:22	amnix	badbodh: Without adding that file, windows move in sync with the mouse cursor. After I've added the tearfree option, the cursor moves first and then the window follows a bit later. It's not really a big problem but it's annoying.

2015-12-20 11:18:15	bitlord	fsociety[00]dat, you should ask intel, also if you downloaded that archive, what does it contain?
2015-12-20 11:18:50	bitlord	fsociety[00]dat, also why are you interested in that? (on the page it says "This software is intended for hardware and software developers using embedded Intel platforms. It is not intended for business or consumer systems.")
2015-12-20 11:20:05	bitlord	maybe someone here knows what it is, but it is not part of fedora project, so don't expect people to know what it does.

2015-12-20 11:25:39	bitlord	fsociety[00]dat, I don't know, intel works with free software community, and they develop/maintain their hw. support. For that specific package (this is my guess) even if it provides some improvements they are related to embedded systems only.
2015-12-20 11:26:45	bitlord	nullbyte_, I guess for executables, it is enough that it is in your PATH to have completion for it

2015-12-20 11:27:18	bitlord	for their arguments (I don't know much about it), you need to write something (related to bash-completion, or *-completion for other shells which support it)

2016-01-08 16:21:46	Kellin	when you do the boot up, before you start the installer, add sshd to the kernel line and then ssh in before you kick off the full install. if you can manage to stay connected (it's the install portion freezing not the whole system) - then you can get logs to submit, otherwise, you'll have go with whatever the last thing shown by tail -f /tmp/anaconda.log Selopin

2016-01-08 17:51:30	Jordan_U	dralley: The problem is that Fedora's secure boot patches add a new command, linuxefi, and remove access to "linux". Ubuntu's patches replace the linux command in a similar way, but without renaming it.

2016-01-08 17:58:28	Jordan_U	dralley: Though, since Ubuntu's secure boot patches don't actually check signatures on kernel images I'm not sure if that will actually work. Since Ubuntu doesn't actually properly implement secure boot for security (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2/+bug/1401532 ) I think your only sane option for dual booting with an Ubuntu derivative is to disable secure boot (which won't signifigantly re

2016-02-09 17:04:24	cube_inc	Well full disk encryption protects your computer while it is off, from what I read of his questions he wants to encrypt the data of each user when they are not logged in. IE: User A logs in and decrypts User A's home folder, sees the contents of other user folders as being encrypted. User A logs out and user B logs in, user B's home folder is decrypted but he sees User A's home folder as encrypted.
2016-02-09 17:04:25	whilhelm	something like layered ecryption partitions

2016-02-09 21:30:20	mercwithamouth	so i'm running fedora 22 and I have a lot of updates I just downloaded. when it prompts me for my root password which i'm sure i'm putting in correctly the prompt keeps coming back up. can someone tell me what's going on?
2016-02-09 21:31:14	kzand	mercwithamouth, are you actually on root user or as you user (using sudo)?
2016-02-09 21:31:51	mercwithamouth	as user with admin rights
2016-02-09 21:32:03	kzand	so you're using sudo
2016-02-09 21:32:05	mercwithamouth	then i can su root using the correct password and i'm able to do that.
2016-02-09 21:32:11	kzand	oh ok
2016-02-09 21:32:36	kzand	so as root user you're using 'dnf update' ? (or yum instead of dnf)
2016-02-09 21:33:02	mercwithamouth	well this is through the GUI

2016-02-09 21:34:18	mutk	mercwithamouth, Unless its asking for root password, in a GUI you should assume its asking for your normal user credential
2016-02-09 21:34:50	mercwithamouth	yeah thats what i assumed at first...then after several attempts of it not going through i tried root as well
2016-02-09 21:34:59	mercwithamouth	the funny thing is if i put the wrnog password in it tells my my credentials are incorrect
2016-02-09 21:35:07	mercwithamouth	i'm wondering if it wants me to put my password in for each individual update?
2016-02-09 21:35:37	mercwithamouth	i haven't used fedora in years so i'm more than rusty.  what would be the command to pull and install all of these updates in the terminal?
2016-02-09 21:36:31	kzand	what I said above, mercwithamouth :)
2016-02-09 21:36:40	kzand	`dnf update'
2016-02-09 21:36:46	mercwithamouth	oops lol. yeah =P
2016-02-09 21:36:53	kzand	but as you, you'd need to sudo

2016-02-09 21:38:35	mercwithamouth	ok thanks man...hopefully this method goes through

2016-03-15 11:15:41	indeedwatson	how do i do that?
2016-03-15 11:16:14	jsgrant	Southern_Gentlem: I was able to get it working, with Arch & Debian; It works, but it's a bit obnoxious.

2016-03-15 11:18:43	indeedwatson	then what is it?

2016-03-15 11:20:15	indeedwatson	Khaytsus: i ran the command in that post "urxvt --help 2>&1 | grep options" and it does not return the unicode3 option

2016-03-15 11:20:51	Khaytsus	It's a build flg.
2016-03-15 11:21:59	indeedwatson	so ti-mo is wrong? according to two people in that post his solution seems to work
2016-03-15 11:22:27	Khaytsus	How should I know?  See spec file. It _is_ compiled with unicode3.

2016-03-15 11:42:23	danrik	oh  -all
2016-03-15 11:42:31	danrik	so "rpm verify all"
2016-03-15 11:42:54	Khaytsus	It's in a manpage somewhere...  5 means md5sum not the same iirc, I'd ahve to look.  I'm surprised to see gtk stuff still showing up..  rpm -qf /usr/lib/libgdk-x11-2.0.so.0.2400.30
2016-03-15 11:42:59	Khaytsus	Same file you reinstalled?
2016-03-15 11:43:51	danrik	comes up sa gtk2-2.24.30-1.fc23.i686. I've reinstalled  gtk2-2.24.30-1.fc23.x86_64
2016-03-15 11:43:55	Khaytsus	http://www.rpm.org/max-rpm/s1-rpm-verify-output.html has info too, I doubt it's changed...  bt yeah, 5 is md5sum, the more important one to look at

2016-03-15 11:45:22	Khaytsus	and I'm not sure, but I'd check and perhaps reinstall the packages of these files:  /usr/lib64/libisccc.so.140.0.4 /usr/lib64/libbfd-2.25-17.fc23.so  /usr/lib64/libopcodes-2.25-17.fc23.so
