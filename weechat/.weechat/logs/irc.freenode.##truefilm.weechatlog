2015-08-17 16:34:18	indeedwatson	did you get confused with the editing after Ray drove off with the tracking device on his car?
2015-08-17 16:36:26	@Carson	no not really
2015-08-17 16:36:57	@Carson	it wasn't super clean, kind of like he randomly showed up to the forest
2015-08-17 16:37:17	indeedwatson	I don't mean that, he drives off, a truck follows him
2015-08-17 16:37:34	indeedwatson	and the very next scene is a similar truck, but it's Frank's
2015-08-17 16:38:02	indeedwatson	so I thought the scene was a continuation of Ray's and I was so confused, like I thought Frank was chasing Ray
2015-08-17 16:38:43	@Carson	oh yeah it doesn't bother me
2015-08-17 16:38:47	@Carson	didn't
2015-08-17 16:38:53	@Carson	but I could see why it would be confusing

2015-08-17 17:28:34	Mothravka	Pretty much the same.
2015-08-17 17:28:51	Mothravka	But as I said once, I have to try it with some nice chili.
2015-08-17 17:29:15	tobylane	My current one is avocado, tomato, lime, olive oil, salt and pepper, smoked paprika and mint
2015-08-17 17:31:14	Mothravka	A bit like mine, but no mint.
2015-08-17 17:31:31	Mothravka	I should try it with some Carolina Reaper.

2015-08-17 22:16:35	indeedwatson	Mothravka: did you start The Wire?
2015-08-17 22:16:55	Mothravka	Not yet! I'm not home yet.
2015-08-17 22:17:21	indeedwatson	where are you?
2015-08-17 22:17:31	Mothravka	Visiting my parents.
2015-08-17 22:17:40	Mothravka	But I'm actually going home tomorrow.
2015-08-17 22:17:41	indeedwatson	ah
2015-08-17 22:18:14	Mothravka	It could take some time for me to continue with The Wire though, I don't want to watch it without my girlfriend, because we started watching it together.
2015-08-17 22:18:39	Mothravka	Have to find the right mood as well.
2015-08-17 22:18:44	indeedwatson	binge watch it and then rewatch it with her
2015-08-17 22:19:16	Mothravka	No!
2015-08-17 22:20:06	Mothravka	I don't think she'll be happy about that, hah! I don't want to watch it alone either. And it isn't my highest priority to watch for the moment.
2015-08-17 22:20:09	puddy	that's gonna take you forever
2015-08-17 22:20:18	puddy	it's a long show
2015-08-17 22:20:35	puddy	and it's fairly dense
2015-08-17 22:20:46	Mothravka	Heh.
2015-08-17 22:20:59	Mothravka	It's going to take me forever to watch all the movies I want to watch too1
2015-08-17 22:21:01	puddy	stuff from early seasons may not be mentioned for seasons at a time

2015-08-17 22:34:32	indeedwatson	never seen total recall 
2015-08-17 22:34:42	puddy	I <3 total recall
2015-08-17 22:35:13	lordhadri	otal recall is kind of in best blockbusters of all time territory for me right now
2015-08-17 22:35:29	lordhadri	clearly an r rating is the key to being good
2015-08-17 22:35:34	lordhadri	that or PG, those are good too
2015-08-17 22:35:35	puddy	I didn't realize when I was young that it dealt with bigger thematic issues of memory
2015-08-17 22:35:43	lordhadri	yeah i didnt remember any of it
2015-08-17 22:36:10	lordhadri	and when he kills his wife in the dream, you're like, she's gonna be so mad at him
2015-08-17 22:36:11	puddy	I just liked it for its insane action sequences, felt really fresh and exciting
2015-08-17 22:36:19	Mothravka	Arnold is so damn bad at acting that it becomes funny, at least in that movie.
2015-08-17 22:36:31	puddy	Arnold is like an anti-actor
2015-08-17 22:36:35	lordhadri	it's not his best performance but he's gamely making fun of his default character
2015-08-17 22:36:35	Mothravka	Yeah.
2015-08-17 22:36:58	Mothravka	His screaming is like music for the ears.
2015-08-17 22:37:08	puddy	"get your ass to mars" has a nice melody to it
2015-08-17 22:37:25	puddy	Verhoven is a nutso director too
2015-08-17 22:37:37	lordhadri	i notice verhoeven never likes to do stimulating action though
2015-08-17 22:37:47	lordhadri	it's always over the top violence with just bullets and blood everywhere
2015-08-17 22:37:47	puddy	stimulating action?
2015-08-17 22:37:50	puddy	oh
2015-08-17 22:37:52	Mothravka	"Give these people AIIIH!"
2015-08-17 22:37:53	lordhadri	like the spielberg kind
2015-08-17 22:38:00	lordhadri	yeah give these people air was the best
2015-08-17 22:38:13	puddy	verhoven bludgeons you with violence
2015-08-17 22:38:16	lordhadri	even in his historical war movie all the fighting is just spraying bullets at each other
2015-08-17 22:38:25	lordhadri	just like starship troopers
2015-08-17 22:38:33	puddy	excessive violence
2015-08-17 22:38:42	lordhadri	but he never lets it look cool
2015-08-17 22:38:45	puddy	i miss movies like that though
2015-08-17 22:38:48	Mothravka	While it isn't really good, I think Showgirls (1995) doesn't deserve its bad reputation. It's hilarious.
2015-08-17 22:38:58	puddy	never seen Showgirls
2015-08-17 22:39:09	lordhadri	it's worth it
2015-08-17 22:39:16	lordhadri	dude loves boobs too
2015-08-17 22:39:19	puddy	obviously
2015-08-17 22:39:26	puddy	why else would there be a three boobed chick in total recall
2015-08-17 22:39:27	lordhadri	black book is boobalicious
2015-08-17 22:39:32	lordhadri	that too
2015-08-17 22:39:46	lordhadri	black book has the witch from game of thrones in it
2015-08-17 22:39:54	lordhadri	and shes nude in that all the time too
2015-08-17 22:39:56	puddy	the red head?
2015-08-17 22:39:59	lordhadri	yes
2015-08-17 22:40:08	lordhadri	she's like the biggest dutch actress currently i guess
2015-08-17 22:40:29	puddy	she seems like a thespian and she's so game for nudity
2015-08-17 22:40:51	lordhadri	turkish delight had rutger hauer's dick in it
2015-08-17 22:41:04	lordhadri	another movie that shouldnt be good but is
2015-08-17 22:41:21	Mothravka	Showgirls (1995) is quite amusing. bit amusing. Verhoeven is undressing the United States. There's not an ounce of honesty left, just sexism, false dreams and a lot of superficiality. The film is self-consciously over the top and silly, because Las Vegas is also over the top and silly. It's like an artificial pigsty, hah. Also, the circular narrative creates the feeling of an eternal loop
2015-08-17 22:41:21	Mothravka	that never ends. It has of course a lot of content to impugn upon, but I appreciate what Verhoeven is trying to do, although he has a huge tendency to become a part of what he criticizes, that's why it isn't a good movie in the end.
2015-08-17 22:41:40	Mothravka	-bit amusing.
2015-08-17 22:41:41	Mothravka	Bah.
2015-08-17 22:42:02	puddy	hmm interesting
2015-08-17 22:42:09	puddy	feel like you can say similar things about Starship Troopers
2015-08-17 22:42:17	puddy	except instead of sex, it's war
2015-08-17 22:42:20	lordhadri	it's like the one time where he lost track of what the audience wanted to see
2015-08-17 22:42:22	Mothravka	Yeah, pretty much.
2015-08-17 22:42:36	lordhadri	people will go to starship troopers for the cool outfits and space battles
2015-08-17 22:42:44	lordhadri	and then get their antifascist themes
2015-08-17 22:42:50	puddy	people misread Starship Troopers as a dumb scifi action movie but it has some nuanced satire going on
2015-08-17 22:42:52	lordhadri	but showgirls went too far
2015-08-17 22:43:09	lordhadri	nuanced? it has neil patrick harris dressed as a gestapo officer
2015-08-17 22:43:13	lordhadri	:P kidding
2015-08-17 22:43:33	puddy	rob ager had a good video on it
2015-08-17 22:43:42	Mothravka	You could fit in RoboCop (1987) in the same category of his movies too.
2015-08-17 22:43:52	Mothravka	He works a lot with satire.
2015-08-17 22:44:08	lordhadri	i saw that recently and felt it was a lesser work of his american period
2015-08-17 22:44:12	lordhadri	still, fuck yeah robocop though
2015-08-17 22:44:24	puddy	i will always love robocop
2015-08-17 22:44:25	Mothravka	It's just too bad he usually always become a part of what he's making a satire of, just like I said.
2015-08-17 22:44:48	lordhadri	is michael bay also guilty of that
2015-08-17 22:44:54	lordhadri	but like, by default
2015-08-17 22:45:18	puddy	i havent seen modern day verhoven films past SST
2015-08-17 22:45:34	lordhadri	black book is the only one i saw
2015-08-17 22:45:42	Mothravka	I don't think so. Michael Bay is probably a genius that knows what the mainstream wants, gives them that, and then enjoys the money while sitting back and laughing at how stupid moviegoers are.
2015-08-17 22:46:09	lordhadri	yeah but i mean what stupid moviegoers want has to come from within him even if he's self aware about it enough to exaggerate it
2015-08-17 22:46:45	Mothravka	Well, I was mostly joking. It's quite easy to see that he actually likes the movies he's doing.
2015-08-17 22:46:51	puddy	what's really weird was the trailer to the benghazi movie looked good

2015-08-17 22:49:00	Mothravka	Such a great movie soundtrack.
2015-08-17 22:49:39	Mothravka	Give that trumpet AAEEIH!!!
2015-08-17 22:51:16	lordhadri	i will see the benghazi movie
2015-08-17 22:51:33	lordhadri	pain & gain wasnt the best movie ever or anything but it sure was a kick in the pants
2015-08-17 22:51:49	lordhadri	and in theory I would love to tell everyone that the benghazi movie is better than american sniper lol
2015-08-17 22:51:52	puddy	pain & gain had tone issues for me
2015-08-17 22:52:08	puddy	i couldnt tell if it was a comedy or a serious drama
2015-08-17 22:52:19	lordhadri	thats every michael bay movie
2015-08-17 22:53:05	indeedwatson	that's pretty much what tony zhou says, that he uses the same style for everything
2015-08-17 22:53:47	Mothravka	Almost like Ozu and Bresson. Hähä!

2015-08-17 22:59:10	lordhadri	yean there's no magic numbers in between there
2015-08-17 22:59:26	lordhadri	do a top 25 of your top 500 lol
2015-08-17 22:59:32	lordhadri	and do a top five within that
2015-08-17 22:59:45	Mothravka	That's.. just.. nasty!
2015-08-17 23:00:14	indeedwatson	why do you need 300, Nolan only made 9 movies
2015-08-17 23:00:25	puddy	ohhhhhhhh
2015-08-17 23:00:46	lordhadri	snaps
2015-08-17 23:00:51	indeedwatson	( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
2015-08-17 23:02:03	puddy	i have trouble rating movies
2015-08-17 23:02:19	puddy	i mean in developing an ordering of movies i like
2015-08-17 23:02:31	lordhadri	i need to stop thinking about it
2015-08-17 23:02:50	lordhadri	just develop a personal canon with no cap
2015-08-17 23:03:02	indeedwatson	I usually put criticker's suggested score haha
2015-08-17 23:03:20	indeedwatson	and then 6 months later I go "that's way too high wtf was I thinking"
2015-08-17 23:03:28	lordhadri	i dont try to fill my personal lists with only insistently major movies but
2015-08-17 23:03:29	Mothravka	indeedwatson: You got me. I don't know what to answer to that!
2015-08-17 23:03:43	lordhadri	i still have trouble even making a list of 50 faves
2015-08-17 23:03:56	lordhadri	i'd rather just say, you want a good movie about this? watch that
2015-08-17 23:04:08	lordhadri	instead of watching the obvious well known movie about it again
2015-08-17 23:04:16	Mothravka	I was trying to rank all the 250 movies in my list, but it didn't go to well in the end. It's hard.
2015-08-17 23:04:24	lordhadri	yeah thats impossible
2015-08-17 23:04:31	lordhadri	i dont even have like a one favorite movie
2015-08-17 23:04:37	lordhadri	there's too many good ones
2015-08-17 23:05:00	indeedwatson	I like the opposite too lordhadri, like "recommend me some movies that give me some insight into your taste"
2015-08-17 23:05:14	Mothravka	You can do it with maybe 20... When you come to 100, it becomes a puddle of confusion.
2015-08-17 23:05:23	lordhadri	@indeedwatson well thats not so hard
2015-08-17 23:05:44	Mothravka	I'll have to go and take a shit.
2015-08-17 23:13:01	Mothravka	I think I'll just mix up all the 250 or 300 movies in my list in the end. Ranking them would give me a headache. I was thinking of doing it in a chronological matter, but I don't know about that.
2015-08-17 23:13:21	lordhadri	alpha or nothing imo
2015-08-17 23:14:06	indeedwatson	you do seem to know every movie's year by heart so you could do that
2015-08-17 23:14:17	Mothravka	Alphabetical actually sounds like something.
2015-08-17 23:14:32	puddy	chronologically might give better context
2015-08-17 23:14:42	Mothravka	Maybe.
2015-08-17 23:15:05	puddy	 this film came before this one was made, was shot around this certain time period, etc.
2015-08-17 23:15:41	Mothravka	It's hard making a choice.
2015-08-17 23:16:09	Mothravka	An alphabetical can actually give it quite a nice mix.
2015-08-17 23:16:45	indeedwatson	if you used something like a spreadsheet you wouldn't have to worry about order
2015-08-17 23:17:01	indeedwatson	since people could sort by whatever column
2015-08-17 23:18:01	Mothravka	You can't have pictures in that!
2015-08-17 23:18:49	indeedwatson	how about letterboxd lists, don't they allow different sorting parameters?
2015-08-17 23:19:01	lordhadri	yes
2015-08-17 23:19:03	Mothravka	I don't remember.
2015-08-17 23:19:07	lordhadri	one of my favorite features
2015-08-17 23:19:19	Mothravka	But I'm making the list in Imgur.
2015-08-17 23:19:21	lordhadri	i love just looking at everything ive rated 10/10 like that
2015-08-17 23:19:29	lordhadri	it's better than trying to assemble a list of favorites on purpose

2015-08-18 16:50:08	@Carson	I enjoyed it more than I thought
2015-08-18 16:50:10	@Carson	more so than other films similar
2015-08-18 16:50:25	indeedwatson	which ones?
2015-08-18 16:50:46	indeedwatson	Baraka?
2015-08-18 16:51:37	@Carson	no, Koyaanisqatsi and etc.
2015-08-18 16:52:28	@Carson	I enjoyed it more than the Qatsi films
2015-08-18 16:55:36	indeedwatson	Haven't seen those
2015-08-18 16:55:48	indeedwatson	But watching Samsara high is amazing
2015-08-18 16:57:41	@Carson	l did think about that

2015-08-18 16:59:18	indeedwatson	I think I cried seeing the mandala

2015-08-18 17:02:33	@Carson	although I don't like drugs or alcohol much anymore because I've seen too much abuse of it

2015-08-19 21:48:59	tomflint	its a shame that it's on Starz
2015-08-19 21:49:09	indeedwatson	but it's hard to find good horror
2015-08-19 21:49:28	indeedwatson	I don't really care where it's on
2015-08-19 21:49:47	tomflint	its purely because Starz won't give them a good budget
2015-08-19 21:50:05	indeedwatson	oh
2015-08-19 21:50:17	indeedwatson	well they got campbell and raimi
2015-08-19 21:50:33	tomflint	I think Campbell will work wherever he can
2015-08-19 21:50:44	tomflint	and he probably pitched it as low-budget
2015-08-19 21:51:30	indeedwatson	well weren't the original movies pretty low budgets?
2015-08-19 21:52:13	tomflint	extremely
2015-08-19 21:52:24	tomflint	I think it's good for horror if its done right
2015-08-19 21:52:38	tomflint	it'll be interesting to see how it translates to television
2015-08-19 21:52:41	indeedwatson	well that's more similarities then :p
2015-08-19 21:53:04	indeedwatson	it's been a really long time since a trailer of a reboot got me hyped for something
2015-08-19 21:53:12	indeedwatson	mostly cause I don't watch trailers
2015-08-19 22:01:04	tomflint	Have you watched Documentary Now?
2015-08-19 22:01:16	tomflint	Its a new series on IFC --
2015-08-19 22:04:15	@Carson	nope I need to look into that
2015-08-19 22:11:50	@Carson	I'm pulling a mothravka
2015-08-19 22:13:56	tomflint	its hilarious
2015-08-19 22:14:01	indeedwatson	Ooo Understanding Art episode about A Serious Man
2015-08-19 22:14:18	tomflint	I've only watched the second episode -- it's mocking Vice

2015-08-19 22:30:34	tomflint	I'm adding stuff for now and then I'll go through and mark whatever I've watched
2015-08-19 22:30:53	tomflint	I've got an automated link to my usenet indexer too
2015-08-19 22:31:07	@Carson	nice
2015-08-19 22:31:18	tomflint	trailers are in the far right column
2015-08-19 22:32:19	tomflint	the plot is trimmed -- which might not be the best. but that's an easy fix.
2015-08-19 22:32:29	tomflint	the inputs for IMDB aren't consistent
2015-08-19 22:33:41	tomflint	this is what I'd like the site to look like. haha
2015-08-19 22:39:37	@Carson	close enough
2015-08-19 22:39:56	@Carson	I just documented half a year of films on letterboxd
2015-08-19 22:40:09	@Carson	and it auto arranged it...
2015-08-19 22:40:34	@Carson	oh wait
2015-08-19 22:40:46	@Carson	there is a sort
2015-08-19 22:41:07	@Carson	I still hate the watched list
2015-08-19 22:41:25	@Carson	I'm not going to add every movie I've watched
2015-08-19 22:41:31	@Carson	I don't get it
2015-08-19 22:41:56	@Carson	I might as well make a list
2015-08-19 22:42:01	indeedwatson	what don't you get?
2015-08-19 22:42:19	@Carson	`
2015-08-19 22:42:28	@Carson	I get it but it's just stupid to me
2015-08-19 22:42:33	@Carson	just not what i want
2015-08-19 22:42:33	indeedwatson	the watched list?
2015-08-19 22:42:39	@Carson	yeah
2015-08-19 22:42:42	indeedwatson	what is wrong with it tho?
2015-08-19 22:43:05	indeedwatson	I like that you just click an icon to add them
2015-08-19 22:43:22	@Carson	because i like looking back to see what I watch during a time period
2015-08-19 22:44:03	@Carson	but watchlist wants you to also add films that you've seen before I started making a list of films
2015-08-19 22:45:00	indeedwatson	I don't get what's the issue tho
2015-08-19 22:45:21	@Carson	I just like organizing
2015-08-19 22:45:24	indeedwatson	any watch list is meant to log movies that you watch and that you remember watching
2015-08-19 22:45:34	@Carson	I might as well keep 2 sets of lists
2015-08-19 22:45:56	@Carson	yeah I suppose I should just make a list
2015-08-19 22:46:15	indeedwatson	but what's the problem? That the movies previous to now have no logged date?
2015-08-19 22:46:58	@Carson	I will have to document my lists twice
2015-08-19 22:47:04	indeedwatson	why?
2015-08-19 22:47:15	@Carson	once of my 2013 list and once on my Watchlist
2015-08-19 22:47:44	indeedwatson	i still don't get it lol
2015-08-19 22:49:54	@Carson	and i can't label rewatches
2015-08-19 22:55:21	indeedwatson	yeah that label thing is odd
2015-08-19 22:55:34	@Carson	I think i can add a note on a list
2015-08-19 22:55:45	indeedwatson	I should rewatch Blue is the Warmest Color

2015-08-20 00:18:49	indeedwatson	Usually they come with subs, specially anime, the subbers seem to have a fetish for making polished subs

2015-08-20 23:45:26	@Carson	what was?
2015-08-20 23:45:51	indeedwatson	It Follows
2015-08-20 23:48:59	keroberos	the ring + let the right one in + the virgin suicides
2015-08-20 23:51:39	indeedwatson	you could sum up most movies as a sum of other movies

2015-08-20 23:52:54	keroberos	have you seen them?
2015-08-20 23:53:35	indeedwatson	not the virgin suicides
2015-08-20 23:53:50	keroberos	you're welcome then :P
2015-08-20 23:54:01	indeedwatson	I was thinking of another movie through it but I can't remember which now
2015-08-20 23:54:51	@Carson	yeah it's a fun movie indeed
2015-08-20 23:54:55	@Carson	works well conceptually
2015-08-20 23:55:38	@Carson	makes me sick when they show the boat scene
2015-08-20 23:55:46	indeedwatson	I'm not a fan of Sofia Coppola though keroberos 
2015-08-20 23:56:10	keroberos	was talking to someone yesterday who tried to dismiss it as 'about stds'. kind of annoyed me
2015-08-20 23:56:38	@Carson	yeah :-/
2015-08-20 23:57:11	@Carson	was kind of confused about the clamshell phone thing
2015-08-20 23:57:21	@Carson	read some thoughts about it but still not sure
2015-08-20 23:58:38	indeedwatson	OH
2015-08-20 23:58:47	indeedwatson	the movie I was thinking of is Under the Skin
2015-08-20 23:58:51	@Carson	did you remember that?
2015-08-20 23:59:01	indeedwatson	seems like the biggest influence to me
2015-08-20 23:59:16	@Carson	on It Follows?
2015-08-20 23:59:20	indeedwatson	have you seen it?
2015-08-20 23:59:21	indeedwatson	yeah
2015-08-20 23:59:35	@Carson	I've seen both Under the skin and it follows yes
2015-08-20 23:59:42	@Carson	I prefer Under more
2015-08-20 23:59:51	@Carson	yeah they seem similar in tone
2015-08-20 23:59:55	indeedwatson	yeah it's one of my favorite movies of recent
2015-08-21 00:00:05	@Carson	yeah same
2015-08-21 00:00:14	indeedwatson	but my point is that It Follows is pretty much Under the Skin from the opposite POV
2015-08-21 00:00:16	@Carson	one of the best films of last year for sure
2015-08-21 00:00:27	@Carson	ah
2015-08-21 00:00:59	indeedwatson	the first time we see "it" it's very reminiscent of naked Scarlet walking slowly
2015-08-21 00:01:01	keroberos	under the skin blew me away
2015-08-21 00:01:20	keroberos	I kind of hated johansson before that
2015-08-21 00:01:41	indeedwatson	I thought she was alright but I didn't think she was as attractive as everyone said
2015-08-21 00:02:06	indeedwatson	But I haven't seen her in many movies 
2015-08-21 00:02:27	indeedwatson	Vicky something barcelona and Lost in Translation
2015-08-21 00:03:05	@Carson	It Follows soundtrack is by same musician of the indie game FEZ
2015-08-21 00:03:13	indeedwatson	nice!
2015-08-21 00:03:22	indeedwatson	I never finished fez
2015-08-21 00:03:24	indeedwatson	I should
2015-08-21 00:04:21	@Carson	Under the Skin sound track reminds me subway and bus sounds, eerie stuff though
2015-08-21 00:05:17	indeedwatson	UtS OST is the only time I finished the movie and downloaded the OST right away and listened to it repeatedly
2015-08-21 00:06:40	keroberos	after I watched The Rover I immediately got the soundtracks for that and Animal Kingdom
2015-08-21 00:07:20	keroberos	best thing about the rover really
2015-08-21 00:07:36	indeedwatson	haven't heard of them
2015-08-21 00:08:04	keroberos	you should at least watch animal kingdom maybe
2015-08-21 00:08:50	indeedwatson	Under the Skin also has one of my favorite movie posters/cover
2015-08-21 00:08:54	keroberos	upstream color was affecting similarly to uts
2015-08-21 00:09:18	keroberos	carruth's range of skills makes me sick
2015-08-21 00:09:42	keroberos	(affecting sound-wise, I mean)
2015-08-21 00:09:49	indeedwatson	I get that one confused with Only God Forgives, for some reason
2015-08-21 00:09:57	indeedwatson	I've not seen either of them
2015-08-21 00:13:38	keroberos	I just watched the trailer for 'the myth of the american sleepover'
2015-08-21 00:13:56	keroberos	some of the lines seem to inform his ideas for it follows
2015-08-21 00:14:48	keroberos	'they trick you into giving up your childhood with all these promises of adventure. once you realise what you lost, it's too late'
2015-08-21 00:15:54	indeedwatson	YT comment on It Follows review: It Follows aka S.T.D. (Sexually Transmitted Demon)
2015-08-21 00:16:38	keroberos	blech :P

2015-08-21 00:24:11	keroberos	makes me want to watch it again :)
2015-08-21 00:25:11	indeedwatson	I want to watch that other movie by Glazer
2015-08-21 00:25:48	indeedwatson	Birth
2015-08-21 00:26:03	@Carson	I liked Birth actually
2015-08-21 00:29:51	keroberos	getting it now
2015-08-21 00:30:17	indeedwatson	Carson: is it atmospheric?
2015-08-21 00:30:36	@Carson	I don't remember
2015-08-21 00:30:47	@Carson	I can't tell you much
2015-08-21 00:32:33	indeedwatson	have you seen Starry Eyes?
2015-08-21 00:40:21	@Carson	nope
2015-08-21 01:01:27	@Carson	should I>
2015-08-21 01:01:27	@Carson	?
2015-08-21 01:02:04	indeedwatson	idk, but guess who has?
2015-08-21 01:03:25	@Carson	who?
2015-08-21 01:03:31	@Carson	moth?
2015-08-21 01:03:46	indeedwatson	ye
2015-08-21 01:04:01	@Carson	he's seen everything that needs to be seen
2015-08-21 01:04:09	indeedwatson	and more
2015-08-21 01:04:10	indeedwatson	lol
2015-08-21 01:04:19	indeedwatson	i thought he only watched a certain kind of movies
2015-08-21 01:04:22	@Carson	I was like that for a while but can't keep up
2015-08-21 01:04:28	@Carson	especially in the foreign area
2015-08-21 01:04:53	@Carson	I actually finished all my tasks for today, and didn't procrastinate, so I am going to reward myself with a movie!
2015-08-21 01:05:02	@Carson	feeling pretty good right now
2015-08-21 01:05:04	indeedwatson	which one?
2015-08-21 01:05:13	indeedwatson	I should play a game
2015-08-21 01:05:44	@Carson	I might watch Avengers 2, even though I know I will hate it
2015-08-21 01:06:13	@Carson	I've been waiting for it to come out, I didn't want to pay money for it though
2015-08-21 01:06:27	@Carson	I don't normally like superhero films that much
2015-08-21 01:06:49	indeedwatson	Friends insisted on that one but I skipped it
2015-08-21 01:07:05	@Carson	yeah I've seen all the marvel films so far
2015-08-21 01:07:07	indeedwatson	that's the type of film I'd only watch on big screen with friends, or high with friends
2015-08-21 01:07:25	indeedwatson	I've only seen Avengers 1 iirc
2015-08-21 01:07:30	indeedwatson	oh and GotG
2015-08-21 01:07:51	@Carson	I've seen a lot of franchises completely actually, I just like to over analyze them and be part of the conversation
2015-08-21 01:08:08	@Carson	I have a few friends who have the same tastes as /r/movies
2015-08-21 01:08:21	@Carson	most average people do though
2015-08-21 01:08:41	@Carson	fun to chat with them about it, which I've heard from a few that Avengers 2 is one of the worst so far
2015-08-21 01:08:57	@Carson	I just choked on a cough
2015-08-21 01:09:04	indeedwatson	lol
2015-08-21 01:09:10	indeedwatson	I'm pretty much the opposite of that
2015-08-21 01:09:31	indeedwatson	I might avoid something just cause it's too popular
2015-08-21 01:09:33	@Carson	of what?
2015-08-21 01:09:42	@Carson	yeah true
2015-08-21 01:10:10	@Carson	but I can't talk shit about it if I haven't seen it
2015-08-21 01:10:21	indeedwatson	sure you can!
2015-08-21 01:10:36	indeedwatson	you don't need to see those movies to talk about them ;)

2015-08-21 01:28:22	keroberos	I just talk shit about the people who watch them
2015-08-21 01:28:36	keroberos	and how they're diverting money from good movies :P
2015-08-21 01:28:41	indeedwatson	exactly
2015-08-21 01:29:04	keroberos	that said, I enjoyed mad max
2015-08-21 01:29:19	indeedwatson	yeah we talked about it a few days ago
2015-08-21 01:29:41	indeedwatson	I saw the 2nd one like 3 days before Fury Road
2015-08-21 01:30:26	keroberos	I watched it with someone who hadn't seen any of the others
2015-08-21 01:30:33	keroberos	needless to say, they didn't get it :)
2015-08-21 01:30:47	indeedwatson	was it a girl?
2015-08-21 01:30:51	keroberos	yeah
2015-08-21 01:31:05	keroberos	I thought I'd be mildly amused but several times I noticed my mouth was open
2015-08-21 01:31:16	indeedwatson	my friend's gf didn't like it either
2015-08-21 01:36:44	keroberos	there's something weird about the fact that animated kids' movies have more emotional depth and complexity than adult-kids' superhero movies
2015-08-21 01:38:14	indeedwatson	they don't need emotional depth I guess
2015-08-21 01:38:32	keroberos	the films or the viewers? ;)

2015-08-21 18:22:45	indeedwatson	did he do one already?
2015-08-21 18:22:51	@Carson	Junun
2015-08-21 18:22:51	@Carson	Paul Thomas Anderson, USA, 2015, English and Indian, DCP, 54m

2015-08-21 18:23:21	@Carson	yes I remember seeing set photos earlier this year
2015-08-21 18:26:26	indeedwatson	I still gotta watch Inherent Vice
2015-08-21 18:26:30	indeedwatson	and rewatch Magnolia
2015-08-21 18:26:33	@Carson	you should
2015-08-21 18:28:22	indeedwatson	I don't have it tho, I have Silent Running and Naked
2015-08-21 18:28:50	@Carson	download it
2015-08-21 18:31:42	tomflint	Inherent Vice was great
2015-08-21 18:42:53	spooky	<indeedwatson> you know, I'm a fan of the Coen bros but I didn't like O Brother at all
2015-08-21 18:43:05	spooky	i'm not a fan of the coen bros. and that's my favorite of their films
2015-08-21 18:43:55	uguuuu	i like the coen bros and i think it's ok!
2015-08-21 18:44:27	spooky	when i watched it i remember being blown away
2015-08-21 18:44:48	indeedwatson	spooky: I can't recall, but I might have been so bored I stopped watching it
2015-08-21 18:44:56	spooky	then i watched something else (i think blood simple or rising arizona) and thinking "why isn't this as good as the previous?"
2015-08-21 18:44:57	indeedwatson	my favorite is No Country for Old Men
2015-08-21 18:45:09	spooky	i think o brother is their most european film
2015-08-21 18:45:09	indeedwatson	I still gotta watch Barton Fink
2015-08-21 18:45:16	spooky	the rest of their films are very american
2015-08-21 18:45:49	spooky	i know o brother features southern hicks escaping from prison, but it has a very eastern european surreal quality
2015-08-21 18:46:03	spooky	the rest of their films are slightly off beat americana cinema
2015-08-21 18:46:28	spooky	i actually think they do great films, they're just not the kind of films i gravitate towards
2015-08-21 18:46:34	uguuuu	i can't even remember which coens i like the most
2015-08-21 18:46:43	uguuuu	haven't watched any in years
2015-08-21 18:46:48	spooky	me neither
2015-08-21 18:46:52	spooky	last i watched was no country
2015-08-21 18:47:02	indeedwatson	Wasn't much of a fan of True Grit either
2015-08-21 18:47:24	spooky	didn't care to watch it coz it's a remake.
2015-08-21 18:47:28	spooky	not a fan of remakes
2015-08-21 18:52:01	@Carson	indeedwatson I can give you a direct download of IV
2015-08-21 18:52:44	@Carson	a lot of Coen Bros film are hit and miss, even though people don't like to think about it
2015-08-21 18:53:10	indeedwatson	Carson: how many GN
2015-08-21 18:53:14	indeedwatson	GB
2015-08-21 18:53:44	@Carson	1GB
2015-08-21 18:53:44	@Carson	tiny
2015-08-21 18:54:08	indeedwatson	nah, I rather wait and get higher quality
2015-08-21 18:54:14	indeedwatson	specially if it's PTA
2015-08-21 18:54:16	indeedwatson	thanks tho
2015-08-21 18:58:09	@Carson	k
2015-08-21 19:02:25	uguuuu	high five for quality standards
2015-08-21 19:03:46	indeedwatson	the only reason I haven't seen The Mirror yet is cause I can't find a good 1080p torrent
2015-08-21 19:04:00	indeedwatson	other than in Karagarga, but it'd kill my ratio
2015-08-21 19:05:33	uguuuu	i'd say... don't get any of the ones on karagarga
2015-08-21 19:06:05	uguuuu	you want a rip from the japanese blu-ray, the other one has a mastering error
2015-08-21 19:07:47	indeedwatson	well if that one is in 1080p at +5gb, I cant find it
2015-08-21 19:09:19	uguuuu	well, i don't know if you'll be able to find it but: http://someimage.com/B9TO
2015-08-21 19:13:15	indeedwatson	interesting
2015-08-21 19:24:44	indeedwatson	uguuuu: I'm pretty sure I found the jpn one but in 720p
2015-08-21 19:28:46	spooky	http://i.imgur.com/krxXdhW.jpg
2015-08-21 19:29:55	uguuuu	where'd you find it?
2015-08-21 19:30:17	indeedwatson	kickass 
2015-08-21 19:30:44	indeedwatson	there's like 4 bluray rips all in 720p, makes me think it's a limitation of the bluray
2015-08-21 19:30:49	spooky	friend of mine sent it to me
2015-08-21 19:31:14	spooky	oh wait, perhaps that was meant for indeedwatson :P
2015-08-21 19:31:38	uguuuu	:V
2015-08-21 19:31:42	indeedwatson	heh
2015-08-21 19:32:00	spooky	hee hee
2015-08-21 19:32:54	indeedwatson	I feel dirty downloading 720p
2015-08-21 19:33:12	uguuuu	i don't think there are rips of the japanese disc in circulation on public sites
2015-08-21 19:35:17	indeedwatson	uguuuu: I took the screencaps from the torrent and compared it from your link side by side

2015-08-21 19:35:39	indeedwatson	http://i.imgur.com/zst58CE.jpg
2015-08-21 19:36:44	uguuuu	well then, maybe~
2015-08-21 19:37:32	uguuuu	ah I see it
2015-08-21 19:37:33	uguuuu	The Mirror 1975 720p BluRay FLAC2 0 x264-CRiSC
2015-08-21 19:37:55	indeedwatson	yes
2015-08-21 19:38:16	uguuuu	CRiSC is an HDB group so it's probably good
2015-08-21 19:38:17	indeedwatson	when I watched Stalker it was that torrent split in 3 parts...
2015-08-21 19:38:25	indeedwatson	it was like 1gb
2015-08-21 20:46:01	@Carson	how is everyone tonight?

2015-08-21 21:20:06	@Carson	working on importing my film lists to letterboxd
2015-08-21 22:06:09	indeedwatson	I added some that I saw pop up on my feed
2015-08-21 22:06:20	indeedwatson	what letterboxd lacks is a random function
2015-08-21 22:06:26	indeedwatson	I really like that in Criticker
2015-08-21 22:07:08	@Carson	better recommendation engine?
2015-08-21 22:07:45	@Carson	instead of just what your friends are watching / whats popular with all users
2015-08-21 22:07:49	indeedwatson	pretty much the best recommendations engine
2015-08-21 22:08:06	indeedwatson	it has score prediction and it's sometimes scary how good it is lol
2015-08-21 22:08:14	@Carson	criticker?
2015-08-21 22:08:16	indeedwatson	yeah

2015-08-21 22:52:30	indeedwatson	omg I'm pretty sure the main character just looked straight at the camera

2015-08-21 23:19:05	indeedwatson	was it a masterpiece?

2015-08-27 18:59:23	inddwtsn	how'd you arrive there?
2015-08-27 18:59:41	inddwtsn	70 people isn't that big tho, it's just pretty avtive
2015-08-27 18:59:43	@Carson	I've read the subreddit in the past

2015-08-27 19:01:05	@Carson	I just don't want to use the mental capacity to learn all of them

2015-08-30 21:48:56	indeedwatson	how is it so far?
2015-08-30 21:49:13	@Carson	I'm really enjoying it
2015-08-30 21:49:51	@Carson	it's probably the best thing I've seen on television this year, and i've seen quite a bit
2015-08-30 21:50:44	indeedwatson	nice
2015-08-30 21:50:48	indeedwatson	is second best mr robot?
2015-08-30 21:50:59	@Carson	eh I don't know
2015-08-30 21:51:24	@Carson	i'd have to check
2015-08-30 21:52:01	@Carson	yeah probably
2015-08-30 21:52:44	indeedwatson	i've only seen that and daredevil and dd was pretty meh
2015-08-30 21:52:56	indeedwatson	oh wait better call saul was good
2015-08-30 21:53:08	indeedwatson	and rick & morty started great
2015-08-30 21:53:27	@Carson	I haven't watch Rick and Morty but i just downloaded it
2015-08-30 21:53:36	indeedwatson	it's so good
2015-08-30 21:53:47	indeedwatson	have you seen adventure time?
2015-08-30 21:53:54	@Carson	i normally try not to watch shows like that
2015-08-30 21:53:59	indeedwatson	how come
2015-08-30 21:54:01	@Carson	I've seen AT but not much
2015-08-30 21:54:15	@Carson	idk might just be my mood or personality
2015-08-30 21:54:33	@Carson	I enjoy them sometimes but sometimes those type of cartoons are a bit much
2015-08-30 21:55:04	indeedwatson	that's what i like, when they go balls to the walls
2015-08-30 21:55:27	@Carson	I'll try it
2015-08-30 21:55:37	@Carson	I'd like to like AT but I don't know
2015-08-30 21:55:52	@Carson	I think i'd have to be on drugs or with friends to like it
2015-08-30 21:56:30	@Carson	I'm going to try watching Avatar The Last Airbender
2015-08-30 21:56:33	indeedwatson	what I like about AT is the optimism and cheerfulness it has while not being pandering
2015-08-30 21:56:51	@Carson	I've seen a few epsiodes, and I've always heard great things about it
2015-08-30 21:58:08	indeedwatson	and at the same time there's this complex lore going on that you get glimpses of, so when you tune in you don't know if you'll get a classic adventure, a one off sort of spin off, or an episode that explores their universe
2015-08-30 22:00:55	indeedwatson	also I can't think of many things I'd ONLY enjoy high

2015-09-23 13:34:10	indeedwatson	aw he's not here
2015-09-23 13:34:24	uguuuuuu	you wanted to beat him up and take his lunch money?

2015-09-23 13:37:24	uguuuuuu	well where da link at

2015-10-07 20:51:00	Carson	wb indeed
2015-10-07 20:52:08	indeedwatson	yo
2015-10-07 20:52:16	indeedwatson	im excited cause i got a kindle
2015-10-07 20:52:26	indeedwatson	sup with you grampaglasses and Carson 
2015-10-07 20:52:46	grampaglasses	indeedwatson: nothing much I suppose. Watched Reservoir Dogs for the first time last night
2015-10-07 20:52:47	Carson	nice what are you reading on your kindle?
2015-10-07 20:52:59	Carson	I'm doing well, relaxing after work
2015-10-07 20:53:19	indeedwatson	nothing yet cause i haven't even opened it
2015-10-07 20:53:26	Carson	what I said earlier about Moth : how so?
2015-10-07 20:53:26	Carson	[19:05:59] Carson did he start talking about Tark? indeedwatson?
2015-10-07 20:53:33	Carson	any plans?
2015-10-07 20:53:41	indeedwatson	but i will carry on reading the books im reading on my phone, Blood Meridian and The Martian
2015-10-07 20:53:54	indeedwatson	he gave a huge list of old directors haha
2015-10-07 20:55:33	grampaglasses	Need to see Grindhouse, Jackie Brown, and Inglorious Basterds now
2015-10-07 20:55:57	indeedwatson	JB is my favorite of his, didn't care for IB
2015-10-07 20:56:04	indeedwatson	thou it probably deserves a rewatch
2015-10-07 20:56:42	grampaglasses	I know it's considered his most mature film
2015-10-07 20:57:21	indeedwatson	which one
2015-10-07 20:57:34	grampaglasses	Jackie Brown apparently
2015-10-07 20:59:46	indeedwatson	yeah
2015-10-07 20:59:56	indeedwatson	i also have to rewatch reservoir dogs
2015-10-07 21:00:24	grampaglasses	boggles my mind how it manages to do the entire movie without the heist scene
2015-10-07 21:00:41	grampaglasses	kind of shows how important it actually is
2015-10-07 21:00:46	grampaglasses	*unimportant
2015-10-07 21:08:30	indeedwatson	Carson: how's the job going
2015-10-07 21:08:46	Carson	okay, it's an internship, and it's almost over
2015-10-07 21:08:55	indeedwatson	oh right
2015-10-07 21:08:59	Carson	so I need to figure out what's next
2015-10-07 21:09:31	indeedwatson	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52raDbtNpa4 have you guys seen this
2015-10-07 21:10:04	grampaglasses	saw a link to it
2015-10-07 21:10:21	indeedwatson	is good
2015-10-07 21:10:52	indeedwatson	seeing miyazaki speak makes me want to hug him
2015-10-07 21:11:06	grampaglasses	sucks he retired
2015-10-07 21:11:16	indeedwatson	yeah :(
2015-10-07 21:11:23	Carson	nice video
2015-10-07 21:11:31	Carson	that channel is great
2015-10-07 21:11:56	Carson	love video commentaries of film
2015-10-07 21:11:56	grampaglasses	I consider Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away perfect animated movies
2015-10-07 21:12:02	grampaglasses	the rest are all good but flawed
2015-10-07 21:12:29	indeedwatson	i think the wind rises might actually be my favorite
2015-10-07 21:12:42	indeedwatson	but i haven't seen totoro yet
2015-10-07 21:12:52	grampaglasses	wasn't a fan of the wind rises
2015-10-07 21:13:19	indeedwatson	i think it's probably his most personal work
2015-10-07 21:13:23	Carson	I still need to watch that
2015-10-07 21:13:33	Carson	I started that but never finished which is odd for me
2015-10-07 21:14:28	indeedwatson	there's a view that it sort of reflects his feelings on popular and modern animation
2015-10-07 21:18:16	indeedwatson	ponyo is probably the most forgettable imo
2015-10-07 21:18:55	grampaglasses	ponyo is complete shit
2015-10-07 21:19:45	indeedwatson	lol
2015-10-07 21:20:05	grampaglasses	only one of his movies I completely hated
2015-10-07 21:20:20	indeedwatson	i felt i wasn't the audience for it
2015-10-07 21:20:49	grampaglasses	see that's the whole point
2015-10-07 21:20:55	grampaglasses	you SHOULD have been the audience for it
2015-10-07 21:20:58	grampaglasses	but you weren't
2015-10-07 21:22:02	indeedwatson	yeah i know, the fact that a film has a particular limited target audience is something i'd consider makes it bad
2015-10-07 21:22:12	indeedwatson	but i still think it's miles above 99% other anime :p
2015-10-07 21:24:17	Carson	haven't been in the mood for a heavy movie lately
2015-10-07 21:24:38	Carson	been watching shit like The Visit, Mission Impossible 5 and Spy
2015-10-07 21:25:02	grampaglasses	oh yeah I forgot about The Visit
2015-10-07 21:25:12	grampaglasses	heard it was marginally better then the other shit he's been making
2015-10-07 21:30:31	Carson	yeah marginally
2015-10-07 21:30:36	Carson	still laughable to me
2015-10-07 21:30:55	grampaglasses	I'm one of few people (actually not really few) who realize he's a shit director
2015-10-07 21:31:33	Carson	I think most people have realized that
2015-10-07 21:31:54	Carson	after Lady in the Water his movies don't even make sense
2015-10-07 21:32:34	grampaglasses	I unfortunately had to watch After Earth
2015-10-07 21:32:42	grampaglasses	imagine Will Smith with no personality
2015-10-07 21:33:22	Carson	I had to watch The Last Airbender, someone paid for my tickets when it came out and i just recently watch the tv series

2015-10-07 21:47:17	Carson	yeah it was
2015-10-07 21:47:31	Carson	but probably more watchable than some other stuff
2015-10-07 21:47:34	Carson	of his
2015-10-07 21:47:52	Carson	I haven't seen wayward pines but I haven't heard anything bad about it
2015-10-07 21:48:03	Carson	have you watched spooky?
2015-10-07 21:48:05	indeedwatson	according to the review i watched, it was worse because things like after earth for some moments are so bad it's funny
2015-10-07 21:48:41	Carson	funny thing is, I used to love M Night early on when I was a kid
2015-10-07 21:48:54	Carson	back when I only knew a few directors by name lol
2015-10-07 21:49:27	indeedwatson	i think we've all been through phases like that haha
2015-10-07 21:49:31	indeedwatson	for me it was Tarantino
2015-10-07 21:49:42	Carson	well I mean when I was 10
2015-10-07 21:50:10	Carson	moat teen or 20 year olds go through a Tarantino phase and stay in it
2015-10-07 21:51:26	indeedwatson	i went through an anti tarantino phase as well lol
2015-10-07 21:51:37	indeedwatson	which was when i watched IB
2015-10-07 21:51:45	indeedwatson	but i found django fun enough
2015-10-07 21:51:49	indeedwatson	tho it had some problems
2015-10-07 21:52:18	grampaglasses	it had problems?
2015-10-07 21:52:30	indeedwatson	mainly, i liked cristoph waltz more than the movie as a whole
2015-10-07 21:53:17	indeedwatson	is that sarcasm grampaglasses :p
2015-10-07 21:53:26	grampaglasses	no
2015-10-07 21:53:36	indeedwatson	you think it's a perfect movie?
2015-10-07 21:53:48	grampaglasses	didn't say that
2015-10-07 21:53:53	grampaglasses	but it doesn't have problems
2015-10-07 21:53:57	indeedwatson	i know, i'm asking

2015-10-07 21:54:14	spooky	<Carson> have you watched spooky? <--- which one? i watched both wayward pines and the visit
2015-10-07 21:54:21	grampaglasses	obviously it's not perfect
2015-10-07 21:54:28	grampaglasses	but a movie can be not perfect and have no problems
2015-10-07 21:56:04	indeedwatson	well besides that i was a bit annoyed of the trope of saving the princess
2015-10-07 21:56:26	grampaglasses	tropes aren't bad
2015-10-07 21:56:40	indeedwatson	they are to me when they feel lazy
2015-10-07 21:58:58	indeedwatson	mfw power rangers remake
2015-10-07 21:59:12	indeedwatson	i wonder if they're gonna make it all nolan gritty
2015-10-07 22:34:09	Carson	i meant wayward spooky what do you think about it
2015-10-07 22:34:17	Carson	I saw the trailer, it looked meh
2015-10-07 22:34:35	spooky	it was meh
2015-10-07 22:34:46	spooky	it started of meh then regressed into retardation
2015-10-07 22:34:54	spooky	the "twist" is VERY stupid
2015-10-07 22:35:10	Carson	indeedwatson, I could see them going with a transformers vibe with the power rangers
2015-10-07 22:35:30	Carson	to make it child and adult friendly
2015-10-07 22:36:14	Carson	yeah it seemed to rely on the twist a lot

2015-10-07 23:07:15	indeedwatson	damn i could've helped him 
2015-10-07 23:07:28	indeedwatson	"nolan is the best director of the decade"
2015-10-07 23:08:58	grampaglasses	yeah right
2015-10-07 23:09:24	spooky	lol
2015-10-07 23:11:02	Carson	and he left :-/
2015-10-07 23:11:33	spooky	he had/has a flood limit on his client
2015-10-07 23:11:40	spooky	so he technically spammed himself
2015-10-07 23:11:46	Carson	lol wow
2015-10-07 23:11:56	Carson	i see that, that's funny
2015-10-07 23:12:02	Carson	maybe he'll be back
2015-10-07 23:12:10	indeedwatson	he was pasting something 
2015-10-07 23:12:13	indeedwatson	but idk why
2015-10-07 23:12:30	Carson	we was using kiwiIRC
2015-10-07 23:12:36	Carson	probably doesn't know any better
2015-10-07 23:12:54	Carson	my co-workers were talking about how great that Gotham show is
2015-10-07 23:13:05	indeedwatson	i heard good things
2015-10-07 23:13:09	Carson	and I'm sitting there like yeah, I don't believe you
2015-10-07 23:13:16	indeedwatson	but im scared it's gonna be like daredevil all over again
2015-10-07 23:13:36	indeedwatson	i really want a good, slower batman detective movie
2015-10-07 23:13:38	Carson	I didn't mind watching DD
2015-10-07 23:13:55	Carson	but Gotham hasn't really looked that great from the clips I've seen
2015-10-07 23:14:09	indeedwatson	i got really bored with the characters toward the end
2015-10-07 23:14:47	Carson	yeah, I'd like to see a miniseries on one of the premium movie channels when it's just Bataman being the Worlds Greatest Detective
2015-10-07 23:15:06	Carson	Gotham just looks shitty to begin with
2015-10-07 23:15:15	Carson	but I'm judging it from seeing nothing really
2015-10-07 23:15:26	grampaglasses	how rude
2015-10-07 23:15:35	grampaglasses	that's like judging The Thing without watching it
2015-10-07 23:15:38	indeedwatson	all i know is gordon is played by the guy from The OC
2015-10-07 23:15:40	spooky	i do that a lot
2015-10-07 23:15:40	Carson	I'm a prude
2015-10-07 23:15:45	indeedwatson	but i literally haven't seen even a screenshot
2015-10-07 23:15:46	spooky	my girlfriend watched part of season 1 and stopped
2015-10-07 23:15:52	spooky	am not into superhero stuff
2015-10-07 23:16:04	Carson	yeah he's not bad, but some of the other decisions look bad
2015-10-07 23:16:28	spooky	oh yeah i saw the kid from the oc on that show lol
2015-10-07 23:16:29	indeedwatson	i thought vincent d'onofrio was pretty bad in DD
2015-10-07 23:16:32	spooky	and will smith's wife
2015-10-07 23:16:34	Carson	I'd love to see a X-Men series on HBO or something, where they actually get to explore the variety of characters
2015-10-07 23:16:41	Carson	instead of skimming over it in the films
2015-10-07 23:17:12	Carson	A lot of people really liked Kingpin, I thought it was fine
2015-10-07 23:17:27	Carson	not the greatest by any means but fine
2015-10-07 23:17:29	indeedwatson	apparently what follows in the Marvel universe after the avengers stuff is pretty dark and not fitting of the upbeat adventure tone it has now
2015-10-07 23:17:36	indeedwatson	so i wonder what they will do with that
2015-10-07 23:18:11	Carson	DD is actually seems fresh compared to all the crap to the latest batch of Marvel films
2015-10-07 23:18:37	indeedwatson	to me it felt very TVish
2015-10-07 23:18:43	indeedwatson	specially the humor and romance
2015-10-07 23:18:46	Carson	yeah that's true
2015-10-07 23:18:57	Carson	yeah that doesn't work
2015-10-07 23:18:57	indeedwatson	like, it was effective, i laughed and wwanted some characters to be together
2015-10-07 23:19:15	Carson	yeah I didn't like the sidekicks that much
2015-10-07 23:19:16	indeedwatson	but beyond the surface i was 'meh'
2015-10-07 23:19:38	indeedwatson	i actually liked the foggy more than matt
2015-10-07 23:19:58	spooky	Carson> I'd love to see a X-Men series <== there was already a series on tv (but it was animated :D )
2015-10-07 23:20:00	indeedwatson	matt felt too perfect for me
2015-10-07 23:20:03	Carson	foggy felt very tvish
2015-10-07 23:20:19	indeedwatson	yeah
2015-10-07 23:20:19	Carson	lol
2015-10-07 23:20:57	spooky	btw: someone asked me if i'd read the martian but now i forget who. was it anyone in here?
2015-10-07 23:21:03	indeedwatson	me
2015-10-07 23:21:16	indeedwatson	im reading it
2015-10-07 23:21:33	indeedwatson	but i probably won't be done with it before it's taken out from theaters, so idk what to do
2015-10-07 23:22:22	spooky	ah
2015-10-07 23:22:33	spooky	i've been reading more now and watching less tv
2015-10-07 23:22:54	indeedwatson	what are you reading?
2015-10-07 23:22:56	spooky	my gf is excited about american horror story hotel but i'll be reading instead
2015-10-07 23:23:20	spooky	i just got a mystery/horror collection from japan
2015-10-07 23:23:28	indeedwatson	as far as tv shows im only following rick and morty 
2015-10-07 23:23:33	indeedwatson	novels?
2015-10-07 23:23:36	spooky	and red mars, green mars and blue mars series
2015-10-07 23:23:50	indeedwatson	because i just read a great horror manga called Uzumaki
2015-10-07 23:23:55	Carson	the show I'm looking forward to most is that HBO show no one talks about The Leftovers
2015-10-07 23:23:55	spooky	indeedwatson: the japanese stories are shorts (mystery/horror)
2015-10-07 23:24:05	spooky	indeedwatson: i know it. about the spirals
2015-10-07 23:24:13	Carson	I was skeptical at first about it but I really like the show/ characters
2015-10-07 23:24:16	indeedwatson	Carson: i've been meaning to watch that for years but never got to it
2015-10-07 23:24:29	indeedwatson	spooky: junji ito is so good
2015-10-07 23:24:31	spooky	Carson: tried watching it if it's the one about people left behind when everyone else "Goes to heaven? or somewhere?"
2015-10-07 23:24:49	Carson	that Max Richter score is enough reason to watch lol
2015-10-07 23:25:00	Carson	yeah spooky
2015-10-07 23:25:07	indeedwatson	i really like the mix of lovecraft and the absurd in junji ito's work
2015-10-07 23:25:18	spooky	indeedwatson: indeed. i like reading the japanese stuff just to get a different perspective on horror/mystery
2015-10-07 23:25:28	Carson	except it's really not about the mystery of what happened to everyone
2015-10-07 23:25:43	indeedwatson	i noticed recently that besides, manga, i never read any asian literature
2015-10-07 23:25:44	spooky	i watched the first episode and didn't like it
2015-10-07 23:25:55	spooky	there was a made-for-tv movie called Testament that already covered that ground
2015-10-07 23:26:02	spooky	even though testament was more religious
2015-10-07 23:26:23	indeedwatson	that premise seems like the opposite of les revenants
2015-10-07 23:26:35	spooky	ineedwatson: i read a lot of asian literature. i'm actually cutting down before people think i'm studying it
2015-10-07 23:26:51	indeedwatson	any favorite writers?
2015-10-07 23:26:58	indeedwatson	asian, and in general
2015-10-07 23:27:39	spooky	i like jiro akagawa
2015-10-07 23:27:52	spooky	fuyumi ono
2015-10-07 23:28:07	spooky	obviously umezi
2015-10-07 23:28:12	indeedwatson	never heard of them
2015-10-07 23:28:30	Carson	the only asian author I know is that 1Q84 guy
2015-10-07 23:28:34	spooky	they're great.very original stuff
2015-10-07 23:28:35	spooky	oh
2015-10-07 23:28:39	spooky	haruki
2015-10-07 23:28:46	Carson	yeah him
2015-10-07 23:28:51	indeedwatson	don't know him either haha
2015-10-07 23:28:51	spooky	murakami
2015-10-07 23:28:54	spooky	i have all his stuff
2015-10-07 23:28:58	Carson	I have so many books downloaded and audiobooks too
2015-10-07 23:29:06	indeedwatson	ok and from the rest of the globe?
2015-10-07 23:29:09	Carson	but I'm just too lazy to concentrate to read
2015-10-07 23:29:19	Carson	even though I enjoy it
2015-10-07 23:29:26	indeedwatson	i read mostly at work
2015-10-07 23:29:34	indeedwatson	and before sleep
2015-10-07 23:30:02	spooky	indeedwatson: my favorite authors are people like poe, golding, conan doyle etc.
2015-10-07 23:30:12	spooky	but i always try and dig for ppl that aren't popular
2015-10-07 23:30:17	indeedwatson	never heard of golding, but i like poe
2015-10-07 23:30:23	indeedwatson	and obviously conan doyle lol
2015-10-07 23:30:44	spooky	i hate reading stuff that's been translated to film because it means they're usually bestsellers that are either 1). popular or 2). getting reissued
2015-10-07 23:31:10	indeedwatson	i really want to read No Country for Old Men and The Road
2015-10-07 23:31:20	spooky	i'd never read either
2015-10-07 23:31:34	indeedwatson	have you read any McCarthy?
2015-10-07 23:31:54	Carson	I have some
2015-10-07 23:31:56	Carson	I have that downloaded
2015-10-07 23:32:03	spooky	i haven't
2015-10-07 23:32:10	spooky	sorry. gotta go for dinner
2015-10-07 23:32:15	spooky	see you guys later (maybe tomorrow)
2015-10-07 23:32:16	indeedwatson	well you're missing out
2015-10-07 23:32:29	indeedwatson	alright gn
2015-10-07 23:32:51	spooky	oh am sure am missing out. but am also discovering my own thing
2015-10-07 23:32:52	indeedwatson	Carson: what have you read from him?
2015-10-07 23:32:56	spooky	gn
2015-10-07 23:37:44	indeedwatson	the reason i love mccarthy is because he writes about horrible things, his characters are despicable, and there's not much going on plot wise, but he has this amazing style, and i just keep reading not cause i care much about the characters or what happens next, but because of the way he uses words
2015-10-07 23:38:08	indeedwatson	gtg sleep
2015-10-07 23:45:11	Carson	I started reading Blood Mer. but never finished :-/
2015-10-07 23:45:32	Carson	I've seen a few of the adaptations
2015-10-07 23:46:19	indeedwatson	there's adaptations?

2015-10-10 19:28:40	tomflint	its funny, that's in my queue for the week. I'm going to watch it tonight.
2015-10-10 19:35:44	inddwtsn	first Godard film I see
2015-10-10 19:36:55	tomflint	his work is amazing
2015-10-10 19:37:46	inddwtsn	i can't say i'm finding it too entertaining so far tho
2015-10-10 19:37:52	tomflint	ha
2015-10-10 19:37:58	tomflint	I haven't seen Breathless yet
2015-10-10 19:39:34	tomflint	I should learn french. I can get the gist of french, but not the subtitles
2015-10-10 19:40:03	inddwtsn	well let me know what you think when you watch it
2015-10-10 19:41:11	tomflint	from what I've read about Breathless, its more about the technical side of filming, including the editing ---
2015-10-10 19:41:34	tomflint	it's considered his best work, but I don't think you're alone in wondering why.
2015-10-10 19:41:56	tomflint	It could be one of those things where some influential cinephile loved it and everyone else has been pretending to love it ever since to save face
2015-10-10 19:42:26	inddwtsn	yeah i noticed quick edits and shit, but it's not like with Tarkovsky when even if I'm lost plot-wise, there's some amazing imagery to absorb

2015-10-11 00:37:40	tomflint	I'm wondering if the natural conversation is new too --- like them having a conversation while she yells 'New York Herald Tribune!' ---
2015-10-11 00:37:47	indeedwatson	i guess it's sort of like citizen kane
2015-10-11 00:38:28	indeedwatson	and i think i was expecting something more than just things that were new at the time
2015-10-11 00:38:33	tomflint	for me, its difficult to appreciate something that's been so influential without understanding the films surrounding it..
2015-10-11 00:38:38	tomflint	exactly
2015-10-11 00:40:58	indeedwatson	yeah, even with citizen kane i feel i can appreciate it on its face value, just a take in itself being cool and the characters being compelling, on top of being first at doing something
2015-10-11 00:41:02	tomflint	its funny -- the scene where he kills the cop is such a crucial plot point, but it was so quick in the film
2015-10-11 00:41:19	indeedwatson	yeah, there's a lot of that
2015-10-11 00:42:50	tomflint	Jean Sedberg is so cute.
2015-10-11 00:42:55	tomflint	anyway, back to it!
2015-10-11 00:44:47	indeedwatson	heh
2015-10-11 01:27:59	tomflint	I LOVE how he emulates Humphrey Bogart in the poster and then gives her the same look during the brief staring contest!
2015-10-11 01:28:01	tomflint	so good.
2015-10-11 01:35:01	tomflint	however, he's an ass... she can do better.
2015-10-11 01:36:37	indeedwatson	i've long come to terms with the fact that pretty girls date assholes haha
2015-10-11 01:37:43	tomflint	only if they aren't assholes themselves
2015-10-11 01:38:01	tomflint	but if anyone is good looking, there must be a minimum of one asshole in the relationship
2015-10-11 01:38:55	indeedwatson	hah
2015-10-11 01:47:33	tomflint	I love the constant stealing of cars
2015-10-11 01:48:00	tomflint	I got an email from PTA telling me that Junun is available.. haha
2015-10-11 01:49:36	indeedwatson	lol wut
2015-10-11 01:49:58	indeedwatson	did you finish breathless?
2015-10-11 01:52:42	tomflint	I'm at the interview part --
2015-10-11 01:52:59	tomflint	when I saw that I got an email from Paul Thomas Anderson I thought I should check it out..
2015-10-11 01:53:14	tomflint	"So… here's “Junun” – the movie we made of our time in India. Plug it into your speakers and play it loud – your neighbors need to hear it!!    Paul"
2015-10-11 01:55:56	indeedwatson	so it's out already?
2015-10-11 01:56:43	tomflint	just today, I guess
2015-10-11 01:57:18	indeedwatson	cool
2015-10-11 01:57:27	indeedwatson	i still gotta watch Inherent Vice
2015-10-11 02:03:00	tomflint	It's good if you like PTA --
2015-10-11 02:03:06	tomflint	if you 'get it' --

2015-10-11 17:07:48	indeedwatson	ok, tell me why
2015-10-11 17:08:09	indeedwatson	i read one article
2015-10-11 17:08:19	indeedwatson	basically said what we said, that it did new things
2015-10-11 17:08:52	tomflint	I felt like she knew that he was up to no good, but wanted to go along for the adventure until there would be some form of consequence
2015-10-11 17:09:51	tomflint	she seemed like a free spirit --
2015-10-11 17:10:26	tomflint	outside of the plot, I really liked the quick cuts that almost showed their thoughts instead of actual dialog
2015-10-11 17:12:58	tomflint	while the artsy-editing was good, there was one cut that made no sense
2015-10-11 17:14:06	tomflint	when he's on the street looking for the next car to steal, he's looking at a convertible and it looks like the owner is approaching him. In the next cut, it looks like the guy is walking toward him from inside a building...
2015-10-11 17:14:09	tomflint	it was odd.
2015-10-11 17:15:01	indeedwatson	yeah it was confusing
2015-10-11 17:15:29	tomflint	but overall, I really liked her attitude. She was willing to put up with a lot of shit either because she enjoyed the banter or she was trying to make it work for the sake of her unborn child --- if she was in fact pregnant
2015-10-11 17:15:44	tomflint	I don't think she was actually pregnant though
2015-10-11 17:16:59	indeedwatson	i dont generally like characters who put up with shit
2015-10-11 17:17:03	tomflint	I say that because she leaves him, tries to order some scotch...
2015-10-11 17:17:15	tomflint	well, I don't think she was being weak with taking shit though
2015-10-11 17:17:23	indeedwatson	she smokes too
2015-10-11 17:17:33	indeedwatson	but i don't think she'd care about that if she was pregnant
2015-10-11 17:17:45	tomflint	I think her carefree attitude was rolling with it, knowing that the relationship wouldn't last more than the night
2015-10-11 17:17:46	indeedwatson	the characters didn't seem very logical often
2015-10-11 17:18:06	tomflint	back then some women smoked and drank if they were pregnant though
2015-10-11 17:18:20	indeedwatson	yeah
2015-10-11 17:18:42	tomflint	all in all, I really enjoyed it.
2015-10-11 17:19:03	indeedwatson	i can't say the same thing
2015-10-11 17:19:15	indeedwatson	but i watched it anyway, "historically" i guess
2015-10-11 17:19:20	tomflint	ha
2015-10-11 17:19:32	tomflint	After that I watched that PTA documentary --
2015-10-11 17:19:36	indeedwatson	and?
2015-10-11 17:19:38	tomflint	which wasn't really PTA at all
2015-10-11 17:19:46	tomflint	and it wasn't even really Jonny Greenwood..
2015-10-11 17:20:19	tomflint	the music was fantastic and it was a beautiful glimpse into another culture -- but it didn't go much deeper than that
2015-10-11 17:20:35	tomflint	the audio mixing is great though
2015-10-11 17:23:39	tomflint	but yeah, Breathless was much better than I expected. I went in expecting it to be historically significant but nothing more -- but ended up viewing one of my favorite films of the year so far
2015-10-11 17:24:19	indeedwatson	really?
2015-10-11 17:24:25	indeedwatson	based on the characters mostly?
2015-10-11 17:24:39	tomflint	I think Patricia's character really captured that free-spirit --- the New Yorker who learns french, moves to Paris, and sells newspapers for a living...
2015-10-11 17:25:22	tomflint	that and Michel's hustling ways -- his constantly stealing of cars and his endless journey to collect his money
2015-10-11 17:25:48	indeedwatson	i liked her but i can't say she was enough to keep me engaged the whole way through
2015-10-11 17:26:04	indeedwatson	and i found him annoying at times
2015-10-11 17:26:17	indeedwatson	we get it, he wants sex, lol
2015-10-11 17:27:55	tomflint	I think that was part of it though. She liked the attention and the adventure. I mean, she meets a guy who might have some work for her, so she plays into him by making out...
2015-10-11 17:28:20	tomflint	later in the same day she's in bed with Michel, playing him...
2015-10-11 17:28:50	indeedwatson	i just felt it got a bit repetitive during that long take of them talking in the bedroom
2015-10-11 17:29:54	indeedwatson	not that im saying that scenes should be as short as to just deliver necessary information, but if they don't usually it's to add a certain mood or tension or room for thought, and I didn't feel it did that
2015-10-11 17:30:00	indeedwatson	maybe it was heavily improvised
2015-10-11 17:30:03	tomflint	totally -- but for that time, that was a completely fresh concept
2015-10-11 17:30:59	tomflint	if you compare that bedroom / apartment scene to Linklaters work, you can see how that style of writing has been refined
2015-10-11 17:31:38	tomflint	Linklater would have cut that down to about half, but still maintained the natural conversation and flow ---
2015-10-11 17:32:02	indeedwatson	that reminds me i have to watch Boyhood
2015-10-11 17:32:30	indeedwatson	but yeah, overall i can say i see the value in it, but i didn't personally like it
2015-10-11 17:32:47	tomflint	you haven't watched Boyhood yet?
2015-10-11 17:32:51	indeedwatson	no
2015-10-11 17:33:01	tomflint	nice!
2015-10-11 17:33:05	tomflint	It's decent --
2015-10-11 17:33:17	indeedwatson	i wanted to get some time away from the circlejerk and the anti circlejerk 
2015-10-11 17:33:57	tomflint	I saw it in a preview --
2015-10-11 17:34:19	tomflint	its great -- but much like Breathless, it heavily relies on the concept of the film..
2015-10-11 17:35:37	indeedwatson	yeah i imagine
2015-10-11 17:35:50	indeedwatson	i wanna watch more classics first tho
2015-10-11 17:35:59	indeedwatson	well, cinephile classics
2015-10-11 17:36:10	tomflint	do you have a good list of what to watch?
2015-10-11 17:36:14	indeedwatson	there's a japanese director i always see named but i never watched a movie from him
2015-10-11 17:36:34	indeedwatson	no, i watch movies very sparsely lately :/
2015-10-11 17:36:36	tomflint	Akira Kurosawa?
2015-10-11 17:36:50	indeedwatson	nah, someone more obscure
2015-10-11 17:37:24	indeedwatson	mizoguchi i think
2015-10-11 17:37:31	indeedwatson	i have a watchlist in lb
2015-10-11 17:37:55	indeedwatson	http://letterboxd.com/spookyfox/watchlist/
2015-10-11 17:38:09	tomflint	nice
2015-10-11 17:38:18	tomflint	if you want, make a copy of my spreadsheet -- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Lh-DTVREaMm9PYIaXr2Ykya7TSrfNm-qei0yYijipoQ/edit?usp=sharing
2015-10-11 17:38:19		[ http://is.gd/lCgizG ]
2015-10-11 17:38:30	tomflint	that list you have is fantastic
2015-10-11 17:38:38	tomflint	Upstream Color is one of my favorites
2015-10-11 17:39:14	tomflint	If I were an executive and someone pitched Locke to me, I'd laugh them out of the room --- but it ended up being a really amazing performance.
2015-10-11 17:39:14	indeedwatson	some are rewatches
2015-10-11 17:39:58	tomflint	Have you read To Kill a Mockingbird?
2015-10-11 17:40:05	indeedwatson	no
2015-10-11 17:40:13	tomflint	that one is worth the read over the movie.
2015-10-11 17:40:26	indeedwatson	yeah i saw it in my list just now and thought it was weird
2015-10-11 17:40:40	tomflint	the film is good, but doesn't even come close
2015-10-11 17:40:42	indeedwatson	i hope it doesn't happen the same as with gatsby, didn't really like it
2015-10-11 17:41:02	tomflint	nah, Gatsby was awful.
2015-10-11 17:41:13	tomflint	it was like Speed Racer...
2015-10-11 17:41:19	tomflint	ugh. Just tell the story...
2015-10-11 17:41:20	indeedwatson	no, i mean the book
2015-10-11 17:41:29	tomflint	oh! you didn't like the book?
2015-10-11 17:41:30	tomflint	haha
2015-10-11 17:41:41	indeedwatson	also, there's a few i've watched from that list, like andrei rublev
2015-10-11 17:41:47	tomflint	My favorite of his is still Tales of the Jazz Age
2015-10-11 17:41:47	indeedwatson	not really, i can barely remember it
2015-10-11 17:42:36	tomflint	lately, Goodfellas has been my 'I don't know what to watch so I'll watch this...'
2015-10-11 17:42:50	tomflint	sort of a palate cleanser film
2015-10-11 17:42:57	indeedwatson	i don't have those tbh
2015-10-11 17:43:02	indeedwatson	i just play games instead ha
2015-10-11 17:43:07	tomflint	haha
2015-10-11 17:44:01	tomflint	I haven't watched a lot of older movies, to be honest
2015-10-11 17:44:25	tomflint	but I'm steadily going through them. I've yet to be disappointed with the classics
2015-10-11 17:44:29	indeedwatson	if the download finishes, I'll watch The Mirror tonight
2015-10-11 17:44:59	indeedwatson	and if not that, probably Naked
2015-10-11 17:45:14	tomflint	nice!
2015-10-11 17:45:23	tomflint	I haven't watched Naked yet
2015-10-11 17:45:41	indeedwatson	I also have Harakiri, but I'm not sure if I'm in the mood for another b&w movie from the 60s
2015-10-11 17:46:26	tomflint	that's on my list after Shoah
2015-10-11 17:47:55	tomflint	Just outside of Vancouver there's this heritage village --- a historical thing. They have a small theatre that runs Charlie Chaplain films all day. I've seen most of his work through there... which isn't really their intention.
2015-10-11 17:48:41	indeedwatson	i've never seen a chaplin film
2015-10-11 17:48:49	tomflint	oh man! they're so good
2015-10-11 17:48:51	indeedwatson	or wait, is chaplain someone else or a typo?
2015-10-11 17:49:10	tomflint	total typo! Charlie Chaplin
2015-10-11 17:49:20	tomflint	His movies are fantastic
2015-10-11 17:49:52	tomflint	Hitler was a huge Chaplin fan --- until Chaplin made The Great Dictator which mocked Hitler and the Nazis...
2015-10-11 17:50:28	indeedwatson	heh
2015-10-11 17:50:50	tomflint	seriously. its why he had that stupid moustache
2015-10-11 17:52:32	tomflint	anyway, I need to jet for a bit. I'm helping a guy build his movie spreadsheet --
2015-10-11 17:52:49	tomflint	he's got a movie club, and his sheet has this overly complex voting system..
2015-10-11 17:53:03	tomflint	Catch you in a bit!
2015-10-11 17:53:34	indeedwatson	hah

2015-10-11 17:53:46	indeedwatson	i will check out the sheet later, see if it works for me

2015-10-11 19:01:13	indeedwatson	i had to make sure the 1080p one was that one from the scrots
2015-10-11 19:01:39	indeedwatson	puddy: i really like Fassbender
2015-10-11 19:02:32	puddy	indeedwatson he's really good in it
2015-10-11 19:02:50	puddy	and since it's written by sorkin, it's very heavy on dialogue
2015-10-11 19:03:29	puddy	danny boyle tries to keep the film visually interesting
2015-10-11 19:03:56	indeedwatson	oh i didn't even know it was by boyle
2015-10-11 19:04:12	puddy	yeah, fincher didn't want to take on the project
2015-10-11 19:06:00	puddy	winslet and daniels are great in it too.. seth rogen is passable
2015-10-11 19:11:36	tomflint	indeedwatson: I think the 1080p one of Zerkalo is just a 720 upscaled
2015-10-11 19:12:12	indeedwatson	i played them side by side, 1080 looks more washed out
2015-10-11 19:12:27	tomflint	the largest version I could find was released 174 days ago and is 6.4GB -- 720p
2015-10-11 19:12:27	indeedwatson	the darks look darker in the 720p
2015-10-11 19:12:54	indeedwatson	mine's 15gb
2015-10-11 19:12:54	tomflint	which release group?

2015-10-11 19:17:31	tomflint	it has three audio tracks -- DTS-HD master, Dolby, and LPCM --- overkill.
2015-10-11 19:17:59	indeedwatson	tomflint: it's probably a rip from the same dvd
2015-10-11 19:18:07	tomflint	bluray
2015-10-11 19:18:09	tomflint	but yeah
2015-10-11 19:18:10	indeedwatson	according to uguuuu it's a problem with the disc itself
2015-10-11 19:18:10	indeedwatson	yeah
2015-10-11 19:18:14	tomflint	you should consider getting into usenet
2015-10-11 19:18:18	indeedwatson	sry i never use physical media
2015-10-11 19:18:21	tomflint	no ratios or seeding...
2015-10-11 19:18:23	uguuuu	the good rip is from the japanese blu-ray
2015-10-11 19:18:27	uguuuu	instead of the russian bluray
2015-10-11 19:18:32	indeedwatson	nah im not gonna pay 
2015-10-11 19:18:35	uguuuu	which was encoded with the wrong ranges
2015-10-11 19:18:39	indeedwatson	don't have a credit card
2015-10-11 19:18:49	tomflint	good to know, uguuuu
2015-10-11 19:18:51	indeedwatson	and if I did I'd start supporting some content creators
2015-10-11 19:18:55	tomflint	like, the russian one is PAL?
2015-10-11 19:19:15	uguuuu	for blu-ray it's just one unified format
2015-10-11 19:19:21	uguuuu	but it probably does have a region code
2015-10-11 19:19:34	tomflint	which ranges are you talking about?
2015-10-11 19:20:18	uguuuu	level ranges
2015-10-11 19:20:28	tomflint	oh sick. That's important
2015-10-11 19:20:57	uguuuu	http://www.caps-a-holic.com/hd_vergleiche/multi_comparison.php?disc1=4643&disc2=580&art=&cap1=43188&cap2=5886&hd_multiID=1062&lossless=&image=1#auswahl
2015-10-11 19:20:58		[ http://is.gd/gPfk61 ]
2015-10-11 19:21:55	indeedwatson	so there's simply no good 1080 release?
2015-10-11 19:22:20	tomflint	ha. I just found those same caps in a different thread
2015-10-11 19:22:28	uguuuu	well, there's the blu-ray itself or a remux
2015-10-11 19:22:33	uguuuu	it'll look as good as those screens
2015-10-11 19:23:09	tomflint	http://www.ivc-shop.com/shopdetail/001010000035/036/001/Y/page1/recommend/
2015-10-11 19:23:10		[ http://is.gd/rC5arY ]
2015-10-11 19:23:28	uguuuu	only japanese subtitles on that disc though :V
2015-10-11 19:23:45	tomflint	yeah, but if you use it as a source you can pull subs from another
2015-10-11 19:24:06	tomflint	I'm surprised Criterion hasn't tackled this yet
2015-10-11 19:25:17	uguuuu	yeah, there are some private trackers with 1080p remuxes or custom subbed BDs
2015-10-11 19:27:55	tomflint	ugh. it's so late in the day
2015-10-11 19:28:20	tomflint	I might make a proper rip of this and post it to usenet one day ---
2015-10-11 19:28:33	tomflint	anyway, have a good afternoon!
2015-10-11 19:39:17	puddy	what film are you all talking about?
2015-10-11 19:44:49	Carson	o/
2015-10-11 19:45:25	uguuuu	zerkalo / the mirror
2015-10-11 20:56:08	tomflint	I just realized that I don't own anything to rip a DVD or Bluray...
2015-10-11 20:56:22	tomflint	my dreams of being a piracy king have fizzled

2015-10-19 20:56:13	indeedwatson	i mean, is it likely i'll know him from something else?

2015-10-20 21:45:21	Carson	yeah I saw that
2015-10-20 21:45:29	Carson	who cares anymore about the Ring
2015-10-20 21:45:33	spooky	that's really pathetic
2015-10-20 21:45:42	spooky	even the japanese (who made the original) stopped doing more
2015-10-20 21:45:58	spooky	and another friday the 13th film
2015-10-20 21:45:59	spooky	amazing
2015-10-20 21:46:21	spooky	i only watched the first one. i don't think i've ever seen the multiple sequals, the prequel or the remake/reboot
2015-10-20 21:46:31	Carson	some shit head tried to make an Easy Rider 2,
2015-10-20 21:46:42	Carson	without any of the original cast
2015-10-20 21:46:55	spooky	well, before hooper's death?
2015-10-20 21:47:14	spooky	deaths have never stopped them from doing sequels etc.

2015-10-20 21:47:36	Carson	it's essentially a fan film
2015-10-20 21:47:43	Carson	casting look a likes for roles
2015-10-20 21:48:27	indeedwatson	spooky: i thought of the perfect example of spectacle + philosophy
2015-10-20 21:48:30	indeedwatson	The Matrix
2015-10-20 21:48:46	spooky	ah
2015-10-20 21:48:46	spooky	yes
2015-10-20 21:48:56	spooky	but such a major hollywood film :P
2015-10-20 21:49:35	spooky	<Carson> casting look a likes for roles
2015-10-20 21:49:38	spooky	thats hilarious
2015-10-20 21:50:39	spooky	has anyone here watched the 'new' planet of the ape films?
2015-10-20 21:50:53	spooky	i don't even know what they're called, but i think they've made 2 right?
2015-10-20 21:51:23	indeedwatson	i haven't
2015-10-20 21:51:30	indeedwatson	never seen any, new or old
2015-10-20 21:51:51	Carson	I have
2015-10-20 21:51:56	spooky	i've only seen the first 3
2015-10-20 21:52:07	spooky	the first movie is amazing. 2nd is okay. 3rd is painful.
2015-10-20 21:52:28	spooky	charlton heston famously told them "if i appear in the 2nd film, only for a few minutes. then you must end the franchise"
2015-10-20 21:52:31	Carson	there is Dawn and Rise
2015-10-20 21:52:51	Carson	and I think the next one is War
2015-10-20 21:53:21	spooky	Carson: wow. i saw the trailers and i noticed the lost the charm of the first movie (and original book)
2015-10-20 21:53:28	spooky	its like they've created something else
2015-10-20 21:53:47	spooky	and it's really more about monkeys using social order and collecting themselves to attack humanity

2015-10-20 21:54:31	Carson	it could be a lot worse, a la Tim Burton Planet of the Apes reboot
2015-10-20 21:55:11	spooky	oh yeah. him. burton is such a fluke. for every 10 shitty films, ocassionally he passes 1 that's decent. so far he's managed 2
2015-10-20 21:55:24	indeedwatson	to me he's been in decline
2015-10-20 21:55:43	spooky	yup. besides ed wood and big fish, the rest is medicore at best
2015-10-20 21:55:53	indeedwatson	i love big fish
2015-10-20 21:56:05	indeedwatson	do you not like edward scissorhands?
2015-10-20 21:56:10	spooky	i did too. i thought it was very charming
2015-10-20 21:56:18	spooky	i don't like ed scissorhand
2015-10-20 21:56:20	spooky	not sure why
2015-10-20 21:56:49	indeedwatson	does nightmare before christmas count as his?
2015-10-20 21:57:05	spooky	am sure when he dies they'll do a remake of edward scissorhand so i won't even revisit the original :D
2015-10-20 21:57:14	indeedwatson	oh i liked beetlegeuse too
2015-10-20 21:57:29	spooky	beatlejuice
2015-10-20 21:57:38	spooky	never watched nightmare or bettlejuice
2015-10-20 21:57:40	indeedwatson	could be because i liked it as a kid
2015-10-20 21:57:54	indeedwatson	i really like nightmare

2015-10-20 22:00:46	indeedwatson	or a similar book?
2015-10-20 22:01:06	spooky	i've read some film books but not that one
2015-10-20 22:01:22	spooky	i read robert rodriguez's book 'rebel without...' forget the full title
2015-10-20 22:01:27	spooky	i think rebel without a film
2015-10-20 22:01:38	spooky	and some other critical books about film techniques
2015-10-20 22:01:47	spooky	and some stuff by filmmakers interviewing themselves
2015-10-20 22:01:53	indeedwatson	i googled the subject and there seems to be a lot of books focuse on hollywood
2015-10-20 22:02:00	spooky	i went to filmschool so i studied film :)
2015-10-20 22:02:02	indeedwatson	i read In the Blink of an Eye
2015-10-20 22:02:38	spooky	are you studying film or reading out of interest?
2015-10-20 22:02:42	indeedwatson	and Making Movies by Lumet
2015-10-20 22:02:55	indeedwatson	just interested
2015-10-20 22:03:03	spooky	ah okay
2015-10-20 22:03:30	indeedwatson	the fact that i only watched one movie from my country should be a giveaway that i'm not studying it :p
2015-10-20 22:03:51	spooky	haha
2015-10-20 22:04:15	spooky	i actually remembered i watched a movie from argentina which i loved. it was sci-fi. but i forget the title
2015-10-20 22:04:23	spooky	it was some years ago now :(
2015-10-20 22:04:52	indeedwatson	man looking southeast?
2015-10-20 22:05:06	spooky	no
2015-10-20 22:05:30	indeedwatson	that's the only scifi movie i know from here
2015-10-20 22:05:33	spooky	it had some good music too
2015-10-20 22:05:39	spooky	i wish i can remember the name
2015-10-20 22:05:40	indeedwatson	because supposedly Kpax stole the plot from it

2015-10-20 22:11:06	spooky	the movies he will gladly go the rest of his life without ever watching agian?

2015-10-21 20:48:51	spooky	i definately cannot see any of his films having replay value
2015-10-21 20:49:07	indeedwatson	whose?
2015-10-21 20:49:08	AJ44	you both should give me some more recs
2015-10-21 20:49:09	spooky	they so plodding and they scream "SERIOUS MOVIE--- VERY SERIOUS PLEASE"
2015-10-21 20:49:11	tomflint	and his style takes a lot from the Austin scene -- low budget, natural dialog, etc
2015-10-21 20:49:14	AJ44	so I can hit them in the weekend
2015-10-21 20:49:27	spooky	tomflint: are you from austin?
2015-10-21 20:49:29	AJ44	i know a bit from the austin scene because of linklater
2015-10-21 20:49:35	tomflint	nah, not at all
2015-10-21 20:49:38	AJ44	if his movies are anything like the scene, then I have an idea
2015-10-21 20:49:39	spooky	you seem to enjoy that austin scene a lot
2015-10-21 20:49:41	tomflint	but I've followed that scene for a while
2015-10-21 20:49:50	spooky	AJ44: i loved linklater's last movie BOYHOOD
2015-10-21 20:49:59	AJ44	i loved pretty much all of them
2015-10-21 20:50:08	AJ44	granted i haven't seen them all though
2015-10-21 20:50:26	spooky	i've seen only boyhood and dazed & confused. i thought boyhood was a masterpiece
2015-10-21 20:50:33	AJ44	i loved waking life
2015-10-21 20:50:37	AJ44	it is certainly epic
2015-10-21 20:50:49	spooky	linklater is a very unique director. probably the most human director
2015-10-21 20:50:50	tomflint	I don't like Dazed as much as his other stuff
2015-10-21 20:50:53	AJ44	it is not very revolucionary, as the concept had been done before
2015-10-21 20:50:57	indeedwatson	the gimmick of boyhood has turned me off from watching it so far
2015-10-21 20:51:07	AJ44	but he took what he does best in his films and put it all in boyhood
2015-10-21 20:51:15	AJ44	yeah, it's not all about the gimmick I would say
2015-10-21 20:51:30	tomflint	that fight in Before Midnight was some of the best writing by anyone
2015-10-21 20:51:33	AJ44	it was marketed as a gimmick, but it should have been marketed as the ultimate linklater
2015-10-21 20:51:37	spooky	boyhood imo wasnt a gimmick but an experiment that worked.
2015-10-21 20:51:42	spooky	it was so unique how it worked too
2015-10-21 20:51:43	indeedwatson	well their marketing campaing certainly was 
2015-10-21 20:51:46	AJ44	yeah
2015-10-21 20:51:50	AJ44	i agree, indeedwatson
2015-10-21 20:51:50	spooky	because he never ALERTs you what's happening
2015-10-21 20:51:51	spooky	it just happens
2015-10-21 20:52:02	AJ44	but if you enjoy his other work
2015-10-21 20:52:02	spooky	what was the marketing for boyhood?
2015-10-21 20:52:08	tomflint	I don't think they meant to market it as a gimmick though
2015-10-21 20:52:13	AJ44	basically, the film that was shot over 12 years
2015-10-21 20:52:19	spooky	ah
2015-10-21 20:52:22	AJ44	even if they didn't, it certainly came across as such
2015-10-21 20:52:29	spooky	yeah... oh well. i loved it
2015-10-21 20:52:34	tomflint	I think that was a result of the critics being all 'how the fuck...' and then the rest of the media following their astonishment
2015-10-21 20:52:37	AJ44	so did I! I'm a sucker for linklater
2015-10-21 20:52:37	spooky	probably one fo the best films of the last 10 years imo
2015-10-21 20:52:59	AJ44	to be honest, before sunrise was the film that turned me on into cinema
2015-10-21 20:53:18	spooky	for me personally, i can also tell the guys that made birdman were all assholes, so i never watched birdman
2015-10-21 20:53:23	AJ44	ahah
2015-10-21 20:53:24	AJ44	i did!
2015-10-21 20:53:29	spooky	how boring was it?
2015-10-21 20:53:32	AJ44	it was ncie
2015-10-21 20:53:33	AJ44	nice*
2015-10-21 20:53:37	spooky	did you see michael keaton?
2015-10-21 20:53:41	AJ44	there is something that bugs me though
2015-10-21 20:53:43	spooky	he thought he was going to win best actor
2015-10-21 20:53:48	spooky	so he was standing up and had a speech
2015-10-21 20:53:52	AJ44	do you guys know about the incredible hulk critic or whatever he goes by?
2015-10-21 20:54:02	spooky	when they said someone elses name he was like "AHHHHHHHHfuck but whatever"
2015-10-21 20:54:03	indeedwatson	yeah
2015-10-21 20:54:13	AJ44	(i had no idea that happened spooky)
2015-10-21 20:54:13	indeedwatson	AJ44: i read his review
2015-10-21 20:54:16	AJ44	well, hulk
2015-10-21 20:54:17	Carson	he deserved it imo
2015-10-21 20:54:17	AJ44	yeah
2015-10-21 20:54:23	AJ44	you know what I'm talking about
2015-10-21 20:54:26	AJ44	i couldn't bother reading it all
2015-10-21 20:54:30	tomflint	Birdman was great
2015-10-21 20:54:33	AJ44	because his writing gimmick is annoying
2015-10-21 20:54:48	AJ44	i have no idea why someone would go as far as he did to deconstruct a film
2015-10-21 20:54:49	spooky	<AJ44> do you guys know about the incredible hulk critic or whatever he goes by? <-- i don't
2015-10-21 20:54:58	tomflint	spooky: who were the assholes?
2015-10-21 20:55:02	indeedwatson	AJ44: tho it's kinda weird cause he usually goes into detail and specifics, and with Birdman he kept saying it was contradcitcing itself, but didn't give any clear examples
2015-10-21 20:55:13	AJ44	it's someone that can stand his ground when talking about film, basically, but he writes all caps with no punctuation just because
2015-10-21 20:55:17	indeedwatson	he did the same with his kanye west article
2015-10-21 20:55:18	spooky	<tomflint> spooky: who were the assholes? <--- michael keaton and innurita or whatever
2015-10-21 20:55:19	AJ44	exactly! it was so confusing
2015-10-21 20:55:30	tomflint	but why are they assholes?
2015-10-21 20:55:36	AJ44	two whole pages of rant, and no point was made
2015-10-21 20:55:43	indeedwatson	but he has some really good articles AJ44, i really liked the Nightcrawler one
2015-10-21 20:55:47	tomflint	you don't need to quote when you're answering a question :)
2015-10-21 20:56:09	AJ44	i haven't watched nightcrawler yet, I should do it asap
2015-10-21 20:56:10	indeedwatson	if a director/actor is an asshole has no relevance to a movie's quality imo
2015-10-21 20:56:13	spooky	tomflint: for michael keaton it was his reaction to losing best actor oscar. director was/is current ego from winning.
2015-10-21 20:56:27	AJ44	i didn't mean to say he doesn't know what he's talking about, I just didn't get the review nor the point of it
2015-10-21 20:56:31	tomflint	who did he lose to?
2015-10-21 20:56:48	AJ44	prob cumebrbatch
2015-10-21 20:56:48	Carson	Eddie Redmyne or whatever
2015-10-21 20:56:50	AJ44	or eddie
2015-10-21 20:56:56	Carson	for Theory of Everything
2015-10-21 20:57:00	AJ44	when are the oscars?
2015-10-21 20:57:04	spooky	indeedwatson: usually for me it does a little. the film industry HAS A LOT of assholes and it's impossible to get good work done because of this.
2015-10-21 20:57:09	Carson	in Feb normally
2015-10-21 20:57:11	tomflint	yeah, that's a good win
2015-10-21 20:57:23	tomflint	the voting system is fucked though. The best rarely win
2015-10-21 20:57:33	Carson	I didn't think Redmyne should have won
2015-10-21 20:57:35	spooky	<tomflint> who did he lose to? <-- director of birdman won but keaton lost to eddie redmyne for theory
2015-10-21 20:57:45	indeedwatson	AJ44: i know, if that's the only article of his you read, you should look more into it (maybe use a website to turn into smallcaps), but at the same time i agree with your view on that particular article
2015-10-21 20:58:03	AJ44	i'm just wondering because i can't remember any 2015 films to be considered for next years'
2015-10-21 20:58:04	Carson	I was thinking Boyhood was going to win over Birdman
2015-10-21 20:58:17	spooky	Carson: i was hoping it did
2015-10-21 20:58:19	indeedwatson	spooky: that's just surface drama to me
2015-10-21 20:58:27	Carson	because I can see a lot of people thinking Birdman was too pretentious
2015-10-21 20:58:28	AJ44	yeah, i'll do that. i just wanted to bring that up, as i enjoyed birdman and couldn't be bothered to read that all just to find a contradiction
2015-10-21 20:58:42	AJ44	i was rooting for boyhood as well
2015-10-21 20:58:56	Carson	it doesn't bother me that much, I enjoyed both films
2015-10-21 20:58:58	indeedwatson	AJ44: the one about Fincher is pretty good as well
2015-10-21 20:59:13	AJ44	i have a tremendous sympathy for linklater
2015-10-21 20:59:24	indeedwatson	ohh, the one about the director of Les Miserables
2015-10-21 20:59:30	indeedwatson	Tom Hooper? something like that?
2015-10-21 20:59:33	spooky	<indeedwatson> AJ44: the one about Fincher is pretty good as well <-- gone girl?
2015-10-21 20:59:56	indeedwatson	spooky: an article from film critic hulk about his view on fincher and his issues
2015-10-21 21:01:43	indeedwatson	AJ44: start with this one http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2013/01/09/film-crit-hulk-smash-hulk-vs.-tom-hooper-and-art-of-cinematic-affectation
2015-10-21 21:01:44	tomflint	AJ44: with the Academy voting system, the best film doesn't win.
2015-10-21 21:02:43	indeedwatson	with all the social issues that are the fad nowadays, do you think the oscars will stop having binary categories for acting?
2015-10-21 21:03:08	tomflint	not for a while
2015-10-21 21:03:32	tomflint	not until women are receiving equal roles, for starters...
2015-10-21 21:03:53	AJ44	i have no idea how the oscars work
2015-10-21 21:04:11	indeedwatson	me neither
2015-10-21 21:04:16	indeedwatson	don't care either
2015-10-21 21:04:28	tomflint	you should know it..

2015-10-21 21:04:51		[ http://is.gd/RaXUBN ]
2015-10-21 21:05:07	tomflint	you'll quickly see how its an irrelevant system
2015-10-21 21:05:09	indeedwatson	it's more about stardom and makeup and costumes than it is about film
2015-10-21 21:06:13	tomflint	nah, not even that
2015-10-21 21:06:24	tomflint	its not the general public voting, for starters
2015-10-21 21:06:37	tomflint	but watch how its scored ---
2015-10-21 21:06:45	Carson	I'm not a fan of the Oscars system, but I enjoy seeing all the actors and film makers in one place
2015-10-21 21:06:52	uguuuu	i think anything voted for by that many people is essentially a sort of popularity contest
2015-10-21 21:07:23	indeedwatson	tomflint: yeah i mean the whole event, not just the awards themselves
2015-10-21 21:07:30	AJ44	i'm setting up netflix for my mom lol
2015-10-21 21:07:46	indeedwatson	i set my mom up with popcorn time
2015-10-21 21:08:04	tomflint	indeedwatson: it really is a popularity contest -- but there's also internal understanding that we, the public, aren't aware of ---
2015-10-21 21:08:35	tomflint	its not an award system designed to reflect the public's views
2015-10-21 21:08:39	Carson	you mean the political and social side?
2015-10-21 21:08:57	AJ44	we got it on portugal now
2015-10-21 21:09:28	indeedwatson	ohh, nerdwriter video about Interstellar
2015-10-21 21:10:06	tomflint	Carson: I think its more personal. Like, a certain editing team may have rescued a really difficult movie ---
2015-10-21 21:10:31	indeedwatson	tomflint: i always asumed money had a say in it somehow
2015-10-21 21:10:34	tomflint	we see a great product, but we don't understand the background work that was involved --- which is something that community would know
2015-10-21 21:11:17	AJ44	ok i'm back
2015-10-21 21:11:26	AJ44	whoa, look at the time
2015-10-21 21:11:29	AJ44	i should be on my way to bed
2015-10-21 21:11:43	spooky	<indeedwatson> it's more about stardom and makeup and costumes than it is about film <-- first you have to realize, hollywood is a business run by businessmen not filmmakers. a lot of the producers, studio execs and even directors, are mostly businessmen. so a lot of what happens in hollywood, is beaurocracy and business. filmmaking is only a technical aspect (does the film look good, does it have an arc for the protago
2015-10-21 21:11:44	spooky	nist, 3 part structure etc). this isn't filmmaking. it's a strategy to make more business :)
2015-10-21 21:12:22	indeedwatson	spooky: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fQ5wOSLPvI he sort of touches upon what we were talking about the other day
2015-10-21 21:12:40	indeedwatson	yeah that's why i don't care about awards or about drama surrounding movies
2015-10-21 21:12:45	spooky	will check it out soon. updating my other machine
2015-10-21 21:12:49	tomflint	I hated Interstellar -- but not as much as I hated Fury Road
2015-10-21 21:12:55	spooky	omg
2015-10-21 21:12:59	spooky	i loved fury road
2015-10-21 21:13:08	tomflint	:)
2015-10-21 21:13:11	AJ44	havent seen both :(
2015-10-21 21:13:17	indeedwatson	really spooky ?
2015-10-21 21:13:19	spooky	i didn't like intersteller because i couldn't see clearly. there is something weird about nolan films how you can't see clearly
2015-10-21 21:13:22	tomflint	AJ44: watch them purely for relevance
2015-10-21 21:13:32	tomflint	why couldn't you see clearly?
2015-10-21 21:13:37	spooky	indeedwatson: fury road was amazing. i wish i was invoolved in the making of that film
2015-10-21 21:13:41	spooky	it was beyond amazing
2015-10-21 21:14:03	indeedwatson	you tend not to like popular things so it surprises me :p
2015-10-21 21:14:12	indeedwatson	i thought it was lots of fun
2015-10-21 21:14:16	spooky	tomflint: it's like it becomes blury. you know the part (SPOILER ALERT) when mathew wakes up and he's on the station on a moon
2015-10-21 21:14:18	spooky	and he looks up
2015-10-21 21:14:23	tomflint	for me, witnessing the love for Fury Road is like watching a Scientology rally ---
2015-10-21 21:14:25	spooky	and ppl are playing baseball
2015-10-21 21:14:29	Carson	wow I didn't know you thought that tomflint, I agree with you o/
2015-10-21 21:14:32	spooky	and he looks up and its like a spiral
2015-10-21 21:14:34	spooky	it was blury imo
2015-10-21 21:14:39	Carson	although there are some things to like
2015-10-21 21:14:44	spooky	also the scene where the ship goes thru the black hole
2015-10-21 21:14:51	spooky	its like "i can't really see what's happening"
2015-10-21 21:14:58	indeedwatson	i enjoyed Interstellar to watch it once on theater with a date
2015-10-21 21:15:07	tomflint	I like the original Mad Max in proper Australian --- but the others are shit
2015-10-21 21:15:09	indeedwatson	2nd watch on a TV with a friend was boring
2015-10-21 21:15:16	indeedwatson	wat
2015-10-21 21:15:21	indeedwatson	2nd mad max is awesome
2015-10-21 21:15:34	tomflint	in your view it is...
2015-10-21 21:15:38	Carson	this is what George Melies worked on
2015-10-21 21:15:40	spooky	i thought fury road was like T2 for the 90s
2015-10-21 21:15:48	Carson	the cinema of spectacle
2015-10-21 21:15:50	spooky	you know how you have these action films that are so good
2015-10-21 21:16:00	tomflint	to me, they're boring chase movies with awful audio
2015-10-21 21:16:18	tomflint	boom boom boom chase chase chase overdubbed voices boooom
2015-10-21 21:16:46	indeedwatson	that sounds like the same argument someone would use to diss european slow films :p
2015-10-21 21:16:59	indeedwatson	replacing booms with long silences
2015-10-21 21:17:01	spooky	yeah to me it wasn't boring. i loved it was all practical. it felt real and organic. the story never stopped. everything seemed necessary. it was so energetic i was like "i need to pause to breathe" but then something happens again and i'm like ohhhhhh shit
2015-10-21 21:17:03	tomflint	I've watched Fury Road twice now. i was convinced that I wasn't into it the first time for an unknown reason... but I just didn't like it
2015-10-21 21:17:30	tomflint	It lowered my intense love for Tom Hardy by two points.
2015-10-21 21:17:39	tomflint	He's at 9.6/10 now.
2015-10-21 21:17:42	spooky	haha made me like hardy even more
2015-10-21 21:17:56	spooky	but i was more impressed by the movie itself not just hardy
2015-10-21 21:18:04	indeedwatson	but it's not about what happens, it's about how it happens. If you reduce any movie to its basic plot points you can make it sound equally lame
2015-10-21 21:18:09	spooky	i wanted it to be bad because i hate sequels, prequals etc.
2015-10-21 21:18:17	spooky	but fury road was incredibly
2015-10-21 21:18:19	spooky	amazing
2015-10-21 21:18:27	spooky	true
2015-10-21 21:18:35	spooky	exectution was brilliant
2015-10-21 21:18:44	AJ44	whoa but wait
2015-10-21 21:18:45	tomflint	its fine that you enjoyed it
2015-10-21 21:18:46	uguuuu	it's good
2015-10-21 21:18:47	uguuuu	i agree!
2015-10-21 21:18:50	AJ44	today back to the future belongs to the past!
2015-10-21 21:18:53	tomflint	I wish I could, but it's just not in the cards.
2015-10-21 21:18:56	AJ44	we didn't mention it yet
2015-10-21 21:19:21	indeedwatson	tomflint: that's kinda how i felt watching Breathless 
2015-10-21 21:19:22	spooky	tomflint: we're all different. you like shane carruth. i love fury road. thats why there are so many movies. you learn w hat you like. you discover your own type of film
2015-10-21 21:19:35	tomflint	indeedwatson: yeah, I can see that
2015-10-21 21:19:39	spooky	without you, shane carruth would have nobody mentioning his movies on ##truefilm
2015-10-21 21:19:55	spooky	and without me, fury road would get no love an admiration
2015-10-21 21:20:02	spooky	each film has found it's audience successfully
2015-10-21 21:20:19	indeedwatson	tomflint: but i don't say it's bad tho, and I hope i can appreciate it better in the future
2015-10-21 21:20:23	tomflint	I also caught his movies on the festival circuit, which is important for indie films
2015-10-21 21:20:33	AJ44	and i'm here to talk about linklater
2015-10-21 21:20:39	Carson	go back to /r/movies
2015-10-21 21:20:39	AJ44	but back to the future!
2015-10-21 21:20:42	spooky	exactly :)
2015-10-21 21:20:45	Carson	:P
2015-10-21 21:20:47	indeedwatson	haha
2015-10-21 21:21:01	indeedwatson	i love BTTF
2015-10-21 21:21:06	tomflint	indeedwatson: do you like Alien and Prometheus?
2015-10-21 21:21:34	indeedwatson	i like Alien and Aliens
2015-10-21 21:21:49	spooky	prometheus was ummmmm (lol)
2015-10-21 21:21:53	tomflint	so this guy made a fanedit that combines Alien and Prometheus -- http://www.fanedit.org/ifdb/component/content/article/80-fanedit-listings/fanmix/1172-derelict
2015-10-21 21:21:54		[ http://is.gd/RLmmnH ]
2015-10-21 21:22:01	indeedwatson	I liked Prometheus at the time, now I think it's bad but not as bad as people like to hate on it
2015-10-21 21:22:13	indeedwatson	interesting
2015-10-21 21:22:17	tomflint	I watched it last night. I don't like either of those movies by themselves, but as one feature, its decent
2015-10-21 21:22:45	tomflint	I love a good fanedit
2015-10-21 21:22:55	Carson	I enjoy Alien, but not Prometheus
2015-10-21 21:23:00	spooky	personally, i think the alien franchise is basically halloween in space
2015-10-21 21:23:01	tomflint	I finished my B&W Star Wars IV ---
2015-10-21 21:23:08	AJ44	last week i saw back to the future for the first time
2015-10-21 21:23:09	tomflint	its a completely different movie without color
2015-10-21 21:23:11	AJ44	the whole trilogy
2015-10-21 21:23:16	Carson	tomflint I randomly started editing Shutter Island to mess around on Final Cut last night
2015-10-21 21:23:23	tomflint	nice!
2015-10-21 21:23:24	AJ44	it was the first old-school cult blockbuster I enjoyed
2015-10-21 21:23:34	AJ44	i didn't care much for star wars
2015-10-21 21:23:37	indeedwatson	AJ44: woah im sorry you didn't have a childhood!
2015-10-21 21:23:42	tomflint	Carson: I think Shutter Island would benefit from having the big reveal earlier --
2015-10-21 21:23:52	indeedwatson	Carson: pls remake the whole ending
2015-10-21 21:23:54	Carson	I feel like that would be fun to edit, change score to a more noir sound, black and white
2015-10-21 21:24:09	tomflint	when you get it done, post it somewhere
2015-10-21 21:24:11	indeedwatson	I liked the first half of SI way more than the 2nd
2015-10-21 21:24:24	spooky	i don't think i finshed shutter island
2015-10-21 21:24:28	spooky	haha
2015-10-21 21:24:28	Carson	I've only seen it once, and was never a big fan of it, I might rewatch, and actually make a fan edit
2015-10-21 21:24:38	tomflint	spooky: you don't have a lot of patience, eh?
2015-10-21 21:24:43	AJ44	i have the poster for shutter island
2015-10-21 21:24:44	AJ44	:P
2015-10-21 21:24:50	spooky	tomflint: i actually don't have a lot of time
2015-10-21 21:24:58	Carson	what are you doing?
2015-10-21 21:25:11	tomflint	we all have the same amount of time. We have different priorities though.
2015-10-21 21:25:14	spooky	work, relationship, reading, going out.
2015-10-21 21:25:17	indeedwatson	I REALLY liked the mystery, I (obviously) love Sherlock Holms and the beginning of SI gave me that same mystery feeling, and then...
2015-10-21 21:25:31	spooky	if something doesn't interest me, i choose from that basket of things to do
2015-10-21 21:25:42	Carson	i haven't watched anything good lately
2015-10-21 21:25:52	AJ44	carson, you should watch computer chess
2015-10-21 21:25:56	spooky	tomflint: did you like shutter island?
2015-10-21 21:25:57	AJ44	that would put you in the right track
2015-10-21 21:26:15	AJ44	i try to read as well, myself
2015-10-21 21:26:22	tomflint	I didn't like Shutter Island the first time through. But the second and third time were better.
2015-10-21 21:26:24	indeedwatson	i read more than i watch movies
2015-10-21 21:26:24	Carson	I'm trying to watch Junun but keep getting distracted
2015-10-21 21:26:25	AJ44	i relate to spooky 's
2015-10-21 21:26:40	tomflint	Shutter Island wins in the details and subtleties
2015-10-21 21:26:44	AJ44	i'm trying to get 150 films this year, and I've read a few heavyweights as well
2015-10-21 21:26:52	AJ44	it was a fairly prolific year culture wise
2015-10-21 21:26:53	indeedwatson	I'm reading Sculpting in Time and internally arguing with Tarkovsky
2015-10-21 21:27:08	spooky	tomflint: see for me, if something doesn't grab me first time, i move to something different. because there are so many movies, tv shows etc. i can't imagine wasting 2hours trying to get into something that's not already grabbing me
2015-10-21 21:27:09	tomflint	AJ44: have you seen my movie spreadsheet?
2015-10-21 21:27:18	AJ44	nope! what do you mean?

2015-10-21 21:27:43	tomflint	these are the films I'm working through
2015-10-21 21:28:12	AJ44	whoa
2015-10-21 21:28:27	AJ44	is want = watchlist, down = seen ?
2015-10-21 21:28:31	tomflint	I built it a month or two ago --
2015-10-21 21:28:44	indeedwatson	spooky: that sort of rules out challenging art tho
2015-10-21 21:28:57	AJ44	jesus christ
2015-10-21 21:28:57	tomflint	want is obvious, down is what I've downloaded, and watched crosses it off the list
2015-10-21 21:29:07	indeedwatson	spooky: It took me 3 tries to read Blood Meridian, it's now one of my favorite books ever
2015-10-21 21:29:16	AJ44	this is massive
2015-10-21 21:29:21	AJ44	how many have you seen this year alone
2015-10-21 21:29:22	AJ44	?
2015-10-21 21:29:22	tomflint	yeah
2015-10-21 21:29:34	AJ44	when does it end? :|
2015-10-21 21:29:50	tomflint	probably about 150 - 200 so far
2015-10-21 21:29:52	AJ44	2000-ish entries
2015-10-21 21:29:53	spooky	indeedwatson: you're right. but it's also about choosing which art you wish to challenge or be challenged by. i viewed a few minutes of shutter island and concluded it wasn't worth finishing.
2015-10-21 21:30:16	spooky	indeedwatson: there are films where i've been obsessed with them. remember i said earlier i re-watch movies A LOT
2015-10-21 21:30:21	AJ44	i can't relate to that spooky, i rarely draw conclusions without plowing through the film or book first
2015-10-21 21:30:24	spooky	i've seen some films more than 10 times
2015-10-21 21:30:29	indeedwatson	spooky: you mean which art as in film vs music vs literature, etc, or which particular works of any form of art?
2015-10-21 21:30:32	AJ44	which are your most rewatched films?
2015-10-21 21:30:33	tomflint	I've been blessed/cursed with the ability to work and watch TV / movies at the same time --
2015-10-21 21:30:45	AJ44	tomflint , i used to do that, it's horrible
2015-10-21 21:30:46	spooky	because coming back to them is almost more satisfying with each new viewing
2015-10-21 21:30:57	tomflint	I memorize movies.
2015-10-21 21:30:59	AJ44	unless you're really good at it, or maybe your work is not very intense
2015-10-21 21:31:08	indeedwatson	i agree AJ44 
2015-10-21 21:31:11	tomflint	like, I can recite movies --
2015-10-21 21:31:15	tomflint	its annoying
2015-10-21 21:31:22	spooky	indeedwatson: film, music, literarture
2015-10-21 21:31:31	AJ44	most i can do is watch a sitcom while playing or something
2015-10-21 21:31:42	AJ44	but it's not as enjoyable as watching it by itself
2015-10-21 21:31:48	AJ44	i wouldnt do that with movies though
2015-10-21 21:31:50	AJ44	they're serious lol
2015-10-21 21:31:50	spooky	eg. now i keep very limited amount of music because there is too much. just like movies. too much. i can't listen to it all or watch it all. now i just keep the music i really really REALLY love
2015-10-21 21:31:52	tomflint	its also why there aren't a lot of foreign films being crossed off
2015-10-21 21:31:53	indeedwatson	spooky: so you give less priority to challenging films?
2015-10-21 21:31:55	spooky	and i listen to it more than 100 times
2015-10-21 21:32:10	spooky	indeedwatson: no. i give more priority to movies i find challenging
2015-10-21 21:32:19	spooky	i think each person is challenged diferently by a film
2015-10-21 21:32:20	spooky	any film
2015-10-21 21:32:24	AJ44	your list is impresive tomflint
2015-10-21 21:32:38	tomflint	thanks, AJ44 --
2015-10-21 21:32:41	spooky	shutter island didn't seem worth it imo
2015-10-21 21:32:50	tomflint	I built it using an API in a separate sheet
2015-10-21 21:32:52	AJ44	although I don't really get the want down etc system
2015-10-21 21:33:03	spooky	tomflint:  you will love spirited away. and metropolis
2015-10-21 21:33:07	tomflint	AJ44: I can take any list from a website or watchlist and input it without a lot of work
2015-10-21 21:33:08	AJ44	it's a bit slow on my pc, so I can't really crosscheck info
2015-10-21 21:33:18	AJ44	have you got a script or something?
2015-10-21 21:33:22	AJ44	oh yeah
2015-10-21 21:33:25	AJ44	do you code?

2015-10-21 21:33:50	tomflint	*you
2015-10-21 21:34:12	AJ44	spooky which are the films you've rewatched the most?
2015-10-21 21:34:12	spooky	tomflint: are these the movies you've seen or not seen?
2015-10-21 21:34:20	AJ44	it's both

2015-10-21 21:34:23	spooky	like M, come and see, aliens etc.
2015-10-21 21:34:49	tomflint	it uses the OMDB api to pull all of the information. I then have some basic formulas to get the information I want to paste in my main sheet
2015-10-21 21:34:58	spooky	<AJ44> spooky which are the films you've rewatched the most? <-- mmm kinda a long list. kwaidan is one i watch more than 20 times maybe
2015-10-21 21:35:05	tomflint	AJ44: the first sheet is by IMDB number, where the second is by title and year
2015-10-21 21:35:15	tomflint	the second sheet posts to the third sheet though
2015-10-21 21:35:30	AJ44	so you basically get the imdb link or something, and it will process for you?
2015-10-21 21:35:42	AJ44	i don't know kwaidan
2015-10-21 21:35:43	AJ44	i'll check
2015-10-21 21:35:58	AJ44	i wish I could tag movies in the letterbox watchlist
2015-10-21 21:36:32	tomflint	AJ44: here's the one I've recently started for music -- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B9edudAv2KIGcv_ZvoQynA4UJyBj2MFG4xc_MxviC9U/edit?usp=sharing

2015-10-21 21:36:42	AJ44	oh, this i can relate to more
2015-10-21 21:36:52	AJ44	my musical knowledge is 100x my film's
2015-10-21 21:36:53	tomflint	AJ44: the reason I went with a spreadsheet is that I want to have full control over the information, tagging, etc
2015-10-21 21:37:10	indeedwatson	that's a very lame music list tomflint :p
2015-10-21 21:37:29	tomflint	its mostly indie
2015-10-21 21:37:39	AJ44	yeah
2015-10-21 21:37:48	AJ44	just with a glance i know your taste
2015-10-21 21:37:51	tomflint	I listen to about 100 of those albums though -- mostly the lounge stuff
2015-10-21 21:37:58	spooky	AJ44: which music do you listen to. i think you and me listen to indie stuff but i'm curious your taste
2015-10-21 21:38:06	spooky	tomflint: i also listen to lots of lounge
2015-10-21 21:38:09	indeedwatson	it's like having a list of 3k movies that don't span anything back than the 90's
2015-10-21 21:38:12	AJ44	well i have a weird taste
2015-10-21 21:38:19	AJ44	i do radio!
2015-10-21 21:38:20	tomflint	spooky: ever listen to luxuriamusic.com?
2015-10-21 21:38:32	spooky	tomflint: yes of course
2015-10-21 21:38:40	AJ44	my all time favorite band is radiohead, but I listen to a lot of stuff
2015-10-21 21:38:47	tomflint	I looooooove Luxuria
2015-10-21 21:38:49	AJ44	basically, every week I do a one hour long show so I listen to a lot of new stuff
2015-10-21 21:39:14	tomflint	I wake up to Ill Street Lounge or whatever in the mornings, but they always play Zou bisou zou ---
2015-10-21 21:39:19	tomflint	I hate that song more than anything on earth
2015-10-21 21:39:26	tomflint	Mad Men made it worse
2015-10-21 21:39:33	AJ44	what's luxuria?
2015-10-21 21:39:42	indeedwatson	mad men makes anything great
2015-10-21 21:39:43	tomflint	AJ44: http://luxuriamusic.com
2015-10-21 21:39:45	spooky	AJ44: radiohead isn't indie. here they're very popular
2015-10-21 21:39:54	AJ44	they're popular everywhere
2015-10-21 21:39:59	tomflint	indeedwatson: they featured this song and immediately it dominated the lounge world
2015-10-21 21:40:01	AJ44	but not commercial
2015-10-21 21:40:08	AJ44	they are just insanely good
2015-10-21 21:40:12	indeedwatson	i've no clue what the lounge world is
2015-10-21 21:40:15	AJ44	basically I started with them lol
2015-10-21 21:40:28	spooky	tomflint: badbadnotgood would be so much better if they didn't make simple instrumentals of hiphop music
2015-10-21 21:40:30	AJ44	but well, i'd recommend you to give a listen to my shows, or you can just see the tracklist for the shows
2015-10-21 21:40:38	tomflint	spooky: totally.
2015-10-21 21:40:39	spooky	action bronson has some good stuff
2015-10-21 21:40:41	AJ44	http://mixcloud.com/amosca
2015-10-21 21:40:59	spooky	i think action bronson's mixtapes are bette rthan his albums

2015-10-21 21:41:31	AJ44	i couldn't care less about the overall site, but the scrobbling is really a nice feature
2015-10-21 21:41:37	AJ44	i just wanted it to be as simple as possible
2015-10-21 21:41:52	spooky	AJ44: sun ra and madlib is good

2015-10-21 21:42:27	spooky	i love queen of siam and the other one with bongo drums
2015-10-21 21:42:30	AJ44	have you heard james white and the blacks?!
2015-10-21 21:42:31	indeedwatson	i actually enjoy the OST of Interstellar
2015-10-21 21:42:52	AJ44	james chance used to be in a relationship with her back in the day
2015-10-21 21:43:02	Carson	same, I was going to mention that, although it might just me being biased because it motivates me
2015-10-21 21:43:12	AJ44	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8L-AizPllw this record is one of my all time favorites

2015-10-21 21:44:20	indeedwatson	but i can't keep up with my podcasts feed as it is
2015-10-21 21:44:21	Carson	i've listened to 99
2015-10-21 21:44:22	spooky	i don't know what 99% invisible is. i don't listen to rap/hiphop or soft rock or rock music/alternative or emo or shoegaze
2015-10-21 21:44:25	Carson	but not all of it
2015-10-21 21:44:39	tomflint	Carson: they're giving out a Challenge Coin for donating! haha
2015-10-21 21:44:40	AJ44	shoegaze is great
2015-10-21 21:44:55	spooky	also radio unless the station is curated by someone i like i don't listen to it

2015-10-21 21:46:29	tomflint	AJ44: its a few stories based around a single theme
2015-10-21 21:46:36	indeedwatson	tomflint: and TROLL with comments about Nolan
2015-10-21 21:46:41	indeedwatson	AJ44: what type of music
2015-10-21 21:46:47	AJ44	everything!

2015-10-21 21:48:14	AJ44	it would mean the world to me if you guys would ever give it a listen
2015-10-21 21:48:32	indeedwatson	and most popular music pretty cliche and boring
2015-10-21 21:48:34	AJ44	its funny since you don't quite understand what im saying, and since you don't know me personally, i'm expecting a less biased opinion about it
2015-10-21 21:48:39	AJ44	yeah, i don't do that
2015-10-21 21:48:46	uguuuu	damn, your taste in music must be really developed

2015-10-21 21:53:40	tomflint	do you have a top broiler?
2015-10-21 21:53:49	AJ44	i've been avoiding cheese, so that's why I haven't eaten any
2015-10-21 21:53:49	indeedwatson	last week i made bbq'd pizza
2015-10-21 21:53:55	indeedwatson	tomflint: it has one at the bottom
2015-10-21 21:54:02	indeedwatson	AJ44: chese is GOOD
2015-10-21 21:54:12	AJ44	i know, I love it
2015-10-21 21:54:18	indeedwatson	tomflint: i could never get it charred at the top like that
2015-10-21 21:54:22	tomflint	indeedwatson: its tougher with a bottom broiler
2015-10-21 21:54:25	AJ44	but i've been avoiding it because of veganism
2015-10-21 21:54:31	AJ44	but let me show you something
2015-10-21 21:54:35	tomflint	indeedwatson: read my method -- https://www.reddit.com/r/Pizza/comments/3nsqfb/four_pies_with_a_baking_steel_recipe_and_method/cvqxhee

2015-10-21 21:55:00	tomflint	with an electric oven and a baking steel, its so easy to make pies like this
2015-10-21 21:55:01	AJ44	just look at that. i really wanted to try that out
2015-10-21 21:55:36	tomflint	are you vegan, AJ44 ?
2015-10-21 21:55:39	AJ44	isn't it hard to make the dough?
2015-10-21 21:55:40	indeedwatson	what's IDY?
2015-10-21 21:55:47	tomflint	Instant Dry Yeast
2015-10-21 21:55:51	indeedwatson	oh cool
2015-10-21 21:55:54	AJ44	as much as I can, yes
2015-10-21 21:55:59	tomflint	AJ44: dough is sooooo easy to make
2015-10-21 21:56:03	indeedwatson	and vital wheat gluten?
2015-10-21 21:56:08	indeedwatson	AJ44: and fun
2015-10-21 21:56:22	indeedwatson	tomflint: is the weight in grams?
2015-10-21 21:56:24	AJ44	haha I would mostly just turn my kitchen into a mess
2015-10-21 21:56:26	tomflint	indeedwatson: that's gluten --- to compensate for the low protein in the all purpose flour
2015-10-21 21:56:31	tomflint	indeedwatson: it is
2015-10-21 21:56:38	indeedwatson	im not sure how to get gluten in itself
2015-10-21 21:56:39	AJ44	i'm looking at your picks tomflint
2015-10-21 21:56:44	AJ44	that crust is mean lol
2015-10-21 21:56:57	tomflint	AJ44: that's a same day dough too --
2015-10-21 21:56:57	indeedwatson	or whether my flour is high prot or not
2015-10-21 21:57:04	AJ44	what does that mean?
2015-10-21 21:57:08	tomflint	typically I do a three day cold fermentation
2015-10-21 21:57:13	indeedwatson	tomflint: i will ask you next time i make pizza
2015-10-21 21:57:16	AJ44	it really looks great
2015-10-21 21:57:24	tomflint	I love making pizza
2015-10-21 21:57:24	AJ44	yeah, maybe I should get some advice as well
2015-10-21 21:57:30	AJ44	this might sound stupid
2015-10-21 21:57:36	tomflint	I make my pies in about 3m30s too
2015-10-21 21:57:44	AJ44	but can you really taste the difference between bought dough and your homemade?
2015-10-21 21:57:46	indeedwatson	i usually do 1kg for 4 doughs and have one the next day, the 2nd on the day after, etc
2015-10-21 21:57:53	indeedwatson	AJ44: of course
2015-10-21 21:57:56	Carson	the chat seems so much busier tonight, idk if it's sometimes like this because I've been away or what, guess it's around 4 or 5 of us active
2015-10-21 21:58:08	AJ44	it's because I'm here! :D
2015-10-21 21:58:08	Carson	random night to be busy though :p
2015-10-21 21:58:13	Carson	probably
2015-10-21 21:58:15	AJ44	haha
2015-10-21 21:58:16	AJ44	just kidding
2015-10-21 21:58:25	AJ44	but it's nice to be back with a client that actually works
2015-10-21 21:58:31	AJ44	I knew it would be a great idea to have an irc
2015-10-21 21:58:45	AJ44	have you got any faq set up on /r/pizza?
2015-10-21 21:58:49	AJ44	noob help?
2015-10-21 21:58:52	indeedwatson	Carson: i tend to talk a lot but only if i have someone else who replies hah
2015-10-21 21:59:01	indeedwatson	i miss moth tho
2015-10-21 21:59:05	tomflint	AJ44: not really. We have some recipes in the wiki though
2015-10-21 21:59:11	AJ44	hmm :(
2015-10-21 21:59:21	indeedwatson	AJ44: i like this article, hang on
2015-10-21 21:59:31	indeedwatson	http://slice.seriouseats.com/archives/2012/07/the-pizza-lab-three-doughs-to-know.html
2015-10-21 21:59:33	AJ44	because the dough kind of intimidates me
2015-10-21 21:59:40	Carson	yeah moth really was the most talkative and then indeed following
2015-10-21 21:59:44	AJ44	i can barely work my way around my veggies, let alone a pizza
2015-10-21 21:59:48	tomflint	AJ44: its tough to mess it up :)
2015-10-21 22:00:08	indeedwatson	i never made a pizza that wasn't edible
2015-10-21 22:00:29	indeedwatson	but i know what it's like to have no confidence that it will turn out even decent :p
2015-10-21 22:00:42	AJ44	hah
2015-10-21 22:00:46	indeedwatson	brb
2015-10-21 22:00:56	AJ44	my food is mostly good, but once I really had to make an effort to finish my meal
2015-10-21 22:00:59	AJ44	it was just horrible
2015-10-21 22:01:09	AJ44	that's what happens when you have no experience in the kitchen lol
2015-10-21 22:01:33	tomflint	AJ44: do you make a lot of indian food?
2015-10-21 22:01:38	AJ44	that's a good article indeedwatson
2015-10-21 22:01:52	AJ44	i use curry and cummins sometimes
2015-10-21 22:01:59	AJ44	not indian food per se
2015-10-21 22:02:03	tomflint	 /r/indianfood is great
2015-10-21 22:02:10	tomflint	so is /r/breadit
2015-10-21 22:02:20	AJ44	maybe i'll do some pizza in the weekend
2015-10-21 22:02:50	AJ44	you guys are inspiring lol
2015-10-21 22:02:51	tomflint	for pizza, a baking steel is really good to have
2015-10-21 22:02:55	tomflint	you can make your own too
2015-10-21 22:02:56	AJ44	what's that?
2015-10-21 22:03:05	tomflint	its a steel plate -- about 22lbs
2015-10-21 22:03:07	AJ44	let me google, just a sec
2015-10-21 22:03:12	AJ44	wait
2015-10-21 22:03:16	tomflint	http://www.kozknowshomes.com/2013/07/diy-baking-steel.html
2015-10-21 22:03:17		[ http://is.gd/TdB0v2 ]
2015-10-21 22:03:19	AJ44	i just have a normal oven, nothing fancy
2015-10-21 22:03:27	tomflint	AJ44: you have a top broiler?
2015-10-21 22:03:33	AJ44	i have no idea what that is
2015-10-21 22:03:36	AJ44	let me google it too lol
2015-10-21 22:03:42	tomflint	nah, look inside
2015-10-21 22:03:58	tomflint	as long as it can hit 550˚ and has a top broiler, you're set
2015-10-21 22:04:13	AJ44	is the top broiler like a shelf?
2015-10-21 22:04:21	AJ44	because my oven has something like a shelf inside it
2015-10-21 22:04:23	tomflint	nah, its an element on top
2015-10-21 22:04:40	tomflint	here's a post from my outdated food blog that documents everything http://hipstercola.com/pizza/
2015-10-21 22:05:03	AJ44	can you link me what a top broiler is? google is not opening
2015-10-21 22:05:45	AJ44	nvm got it
2015-10-21 22:06:02	AJ44	yeah I don't know what you mean by top broiler
2015-10-21 22:06:23	tomflint	most electric ovens have it
2015-10-21 22:06:33	AJ44	it can only do 480 ish
2015-10-21 22:06:49	AJ44	250 celsius is 482 fahrenheit
2015-10-21 22:06:54	AJ44	is that a problem?
2015-10-21 22:06:57	tomflint	that's fine. Just preheat the steel for an extra 10 minutes and then broil for an extra 5 or so
2015-10-21 22:07:16	AJ44	ok. define broil
2015-10-21 22:07:24	Carson	welcome to ##truefood
2015-10-21 22:07:28	tomflint	its an element that gets crazy hot
2015-10-21 22:07:38	tomflint	its either high or low in temperature ---
2015-10-21 22:07:57	AJ44	haha Carson
2015-10-21 22:07:57	tomflint	they can reach 600˚ or more
2015-10-21 22:08:04	AJ44	i'll check with my mom tomorro
2015-10-21 22:08:14	tomflint	I can ask her now...
2015-10-21 22:08:18	tomflint	she's just in the shower though
2015-10-21 22:08:19	AJ44	but i don't think we have that
2015-10-21 22:08:21	AJ44	oooooh
2015-10-21 22:08:22	tomflint	zing!
2015-10-21 22:08:26	AJ44	naughty boy
2015-10-21 22:08:32	AJ44	well my oven isn't modern by any means
2015-10-21 22:08:38	AJ44	it's surely 18 years old or so
2015-10-21 22:08:46	AJ44	is it supposed to have a broiler?
2015-10-21 22:08:49	tomflint	any electric oven thats under 50 years old will have it
2015-10-21 22:08:59	tomflint	yeah. look inside the oven and you'll see it
2015-10-21 22:09:30	tomflint	for pizza, its best to have a wooden pizza peel to launch the pies, and an aluminum one to retrieve
2015-10-21 22:09:50	tomflint	but with a few basic tools, you can make the pies like I make with ease
2015-10-21 22:10:17	tomflint	I've been making pizza for about 15 years now -- but it wasn't until I got a steel that I've been really happy wth the results
2015-10-21 22:10:22	AJ44	i just want to do the basic stuff for a while
2015-10-21 22:10:27	AJ44	to get thehang of it
2015-10-21 22:10:43	AJ44	i'll do the dough and the sauce
2015-10-21 22:10:45	AJ44	and that's a lot!
2015-10-21 22:10:56	tomflint	you can make pies using a pizza pan or whatever..
2015-10-21 22:10:58	AJ44	do you do pizzas without cheese?
2015-10-21 22:11:03	tomflint	but its best to have the peels.
2015-10-21 22:11:13	tomflint	nah, I use either fresh mozza or normal mozza
2015-10-21 22:12:22	AJ44	okay
2015-10-21 22:12:31	AJ44	i'm going to do a substitute using cashew
2015-10-21 22:12:58	AJ44	i shouldn't be talking about food so late in the day lol
2015-10-21 22:13:30	AJ44	http://vedgedout.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/top-view.jpg look at that
2015-10-21 22:13:30		[ http://is.gd/ILDh2h ]
2015-10-21 22:14:22	tomflint	yow. that's burrrrnnned
2015-10-21 22:14:44	tomflint	I like a good char, but this is a time-based burn
2015-10-21 22:15:09	tomflint	whoever made that needs to have a higher direct temperature for a shorter time
2015-10-21 22:15:22	AJ44	ahaha
2015-10-21 22:15:36	AJ44	well I wouldn't know
2015-10-21 22:15:41	AJ44	it looks great to me
2015-10-21 22:16:00	AJ44	but you obviously know your way around it better than I do
2015-10-21 22:16:08	tomflint	ideally you want 'leoparding'

2015-10-21 22:17:11	AJ44	have you been developing your own tomato sauce?
2015-10-21 22:17:15	tomflint	that's most likely a wood fired pizza
2015-10-21 22:17:17	AJ44	and do you basically just eat pizza?
2015-10-21 22:17:23	tomflint	yeah, but I make everything from scratch
2015-10-21 22:17:43	tomflint	I make my own pizza about once a month or so, and go out for pizza about twice a month
2015-10-21 22:18:43	tomflint	speaking of dinner, I need to go pick it up
2015-10-21 22:18:54	tomflint	I'll be back in a bit though
2015-10-21 22:25:32	indeedwatson	im back

2015-10-21 22:26:43	spooky	and begin the evening ritual of watching tv, then reading a book
2015-10-21 22:27:06	indeedwatson	i read enough at work
2015-10-21 22:27:30	spooky	yeah i was doing script coverage all morning

2015-10-21 22:28:14	indeedwatson	im reading neuromancer
2015-10-21 22:28:20	spooky	nice. i have that too
2015-10-21 22:28:31	spooky	both ebook and real book
2015-10-21 22:28:37	indeedwatson	the matrix lifted so much from it
2015-10-21 22:28:54	spooky	it also lifted a lot from japanese anime
2015-10-21 22:29:00	spooky	especially the action scenes
2015-10-21 22:29:17	indeedwatson	yeah
2015-10-21 22:29:46	indeedwatson	makes me sad all the great sci fi anime from the 80s and now nothing comes close to that 
2015-10-21 22:29:52	AJ44	oh boy
2015-10-21 22:29:57	AJ44	another very interesting conversation
2015-10-21 22:30:04	AJ44	i'm reading somerset maugham
2015-10-21 22:30:17	AJ44	but i must go now, because I have pilates early in the morning lol
2015-10-21 22:30:24	indeedwatson	morning?
2015-10-21 22:30:29	AJ44	yeah
2015-10-21 22:30:30	indeedwatson	are you in australia
2015-10-21 22:30:31	spooky	indeedwatson: i don't mind. there is enough good 80s sci-fi to watch till we die. now we can concentrate on books
2015-10-21 22:30:50	spooky	i actually now like to watch trailers. they save me having to watch the full movie
2015-10-21 22:30:54	spooky	then i can read more :)
2015-10-21 22:31:04	spooky	since the movies are shit anyway
2015-10-21 22:31:15	spooky	i still watch the best parts, save $20, and read more books
2015-10-21 22:31:36	indeedwatson	spooky: but it makes me really curious why artists like Katsuhiro Otomo never made anything great again
2015-10-21 22:31:37	AJ44	in 6h

2015-10-21 22:32:02	spooky	meanwhile others waste $20+15 for popcorn and soda, waste 2 hours watching a movie they will forget soon and end up reading less and thus, just wait for that cycle to start again
2015-10-21 22:32:20	indeedwatson	i do both :p
2015-10-21 22:32:36	spooky	indeedwatson: sometimes, they have just a few important things to say. after that, the other stuff is full. sometimes they're just lucky
2015-10-21 22:33:00	spooky	indeedwatson: i can't do both (watch a full movie and read). not enough time. and there are too many of both (including listening to music)

2015-10-21 22:34:42	spooky	so i hate wasting time
2015-10-21 22:35:03	spooky	i can't imagine just sitting and watch a movie for 2 hours and i hate it. hahaha it kills me
2015-10-21 22:35:05	indeedwatson	i rarely go out
2015-10-21 22:35:06	spooky	i'd rather do something else
2015-10-21 22:35:18	spooky	i go out a lot
2015-10-21 22:35:23	spooky	even now am about to go out
2015-10-21 22:35:35	spooky	so now me and my gf only watch 1 tv show a day
2015-10-21 22:35:39	indeedwatson	to me it's the opposite, going out to buy records sounds like a waste of time
2015-10-21 22:35:44	spooky	but only 3/week
2015-10-21 22:36:09	spooky	ah for me i like it because there is a lot of records i find which you can't find on mp3/cd/cassette
2015-10-21 22:36:13	spooky	they were only made on vinyl
2015-10-21 22:36:28	indeedwatson	there's not much i can't find on torrent these days
2015-10-21 22:36:28	spooky	its like discovering something new nobody else knows about (except others who do the same)
2015-10-21 22:36:34	spooky	haha
2015-10-21 22:36:52	spooky	trust me. in fact, some i even found (on mp3) but it's not on the biggest torrent sites
2015-10-21 22:37:44	spooky	if you like mainstream stuff. its very easy to find on mp3
2015-10-21 22:37:44	indeedwatson	i like things nobody else knows about (like the band i linked earlier), but not BECAUSE no one knows about it
2015-10-21 22:37:45	spooky	i agree
2015-10-21 22:37:54	spooky	i can find something for friends in 5 seconds
2015-10-21 22:38:57	spooky	i agree with you. you gotta love the music first. but most of t hat stuff (which is not reissued or nobody has) is failed for a reason. sometimes its because it was too weird
2015-10-21 22:39:18	spooky	i found a record a guy made because his neighbor talks very loudly in his sleep
2015-10-21 22:39:37	spooky	but he talks like he is reading something. he's basically narrating his dream
2015-10-21 22:39:53	indeedwatson	lol
2015-10-21 22:40:18	spooky	when you find something like that for the first time on vinyl, and you hold the record and read the back sleeve, it's like finding gold
2015-10-21 22:41:07	indeedwatson	if i found that on YT i'd probably skip it within 1 min :p i don't care for medium
2015-10-21 22:41:26	indeedwatson	sounds kinda like Stockhausen
2015-10-21 22:41:31	spooky	yes
2015-10-21 22:41:36	spooky	its kinda like stockhausen for sure
2015-10-21 22:41:53	spooky	that kind of record disappeared because not many people bought it
2015-10-21 22:41:58	spooky	but i prefer to dsicover that
2015-10-21 22:42:01	spooky	instead of the other stuff
2015-10-21 22:42:07	spooky	imo it's more interesting
2015-10-21 22:42:24	spooky	its like another world where the stuff which isn't popular is more popular
2015-10-21 22:42:31	indeedwatson	yeah we have very different views on that
2015-10-21 22:42:37	spooky	for sure
2015-10-21 22:42:44	indeedwatson	i give very little importance to how i came across something
2015-10-21 22:42:56	spooky	oh i don't either
2015-10-21 22:43:03	spooky	i wish i could find everything i wanted on torrents
2015-10-21 22:43:05	spooky	i just can't
2015-10-21 22:43:22	spooky	80% of my itunes came from somewhere else
2015-10-21 22:43:41	spooky	maybe one day i will upload to a torrent site and get a big upload score
2015-10-21 22:43:51	indeedwatson	would you like that same music as much if you can find it easily on YT?
2015-10-21 22:44:09	spooky	sure. some i found on youtube
2015-10-21 22:44:16	spooky	i mean, thats how i knew what to look for
2015-10-21 22:44:30	spooky	many bands from other countries i have to search on youtube
2015-10-21 22:44:42	spooky	but the whole album i have to find somewhere else because youtube is only streaming
2015-10-21 22:45:11	indeedwatson	streaming?
2015-10-21 22:46:29	uguuuu	now i think he's trying to decide whether or not to explain the concept of streaming video/audio over the internet
2015-10-21 22:46:37	indeedwatson	haha
2015-10-21 22:46:39	spooky	no
2015-10-21 22:46:42	spooky	i was texting my gf
2015-10-21 22:46:42	indeedwatson	but you can download stuff from yt
2015-10-21 22:46:55	spooky	i don't download from youtube because of kwality
2015-10-21 22:47:05	uguuuu	yeah don't do that :o
2015-10-21 22:48:19	indeedwatson	aren't there some yt audio in 320kbps?
2015-10-21 22:48:19	spooky	yeah. i dont
2015-10-21 22:48:31	spooky	don't know. never downloaded
2015-10-21 22:48:57	indeedwatson	i'd do blind tests before you dismiss it, you might be surprised
2015-10-21 22:49:00	uguuuu	well anyway i don't think there's anything wrong with placing value in the physical artifact
2015-10-21 22:49:41	indeedwatson	personal value i guess, but i try not to let if influence my view of the content itself
2015-10-21 22:50:40	spooky	yeah of course
2015-10-21 22:51:01	spooky	its impossible to articulate because also the musical itself is very different from what is mainstream and available to everyone else
2015-10-21 22:51:19	uguuuu	i wouldn't download anything from youtube for my actual listening/watching collection because if the person who uploaded it could find it I probably could as well
2015-10-21 22:51:40	indeedwatson	i don't like mainstream music at all
2015-10-21 22:52:37	indeedwatson	nor most of recent music
2015-10-21 22:52:44	spooky	uguuu: sometimes this is not the case. i found some records ppl uploaded after t hey said they only got 1 song
2015-10-21 22:53:07	indeedwatson	uguuuu: i've had albums that i found and got stuck at 98% :(
2015-10-21 22:53:22	uguuuu	:v
2015-10-21 22:53:30	uguuuu	what sort of music DO you like?
2015-10-21 22:53:39	indeedwatson	or that have 2 seeds and take 6 weeks to download one CD
2015-10-21 22:53:48	indeedwatson	me? or spooky 
2015-10-21 22:53:52	uguuuu	both
2015-10-21 22:54:04	indeedwatson	mostly classical
2015-10-21 22:54:12	indeedwatson	then jazz, prog rock
2015-10-21 22:54:21	indeedwatson	and weird stuff like Dawn of Midi
2015-10-21 22:54:58	spooky	i listen to anything that's a little psychadellic, or progressive, or jazz, or funky. i like stuff from different countries. anything experimental and fun
2015-10-21 22:56:03	indeedwatson	i like psychadelic but i find it doesn't hold up much if i listen to it several times, like it wears off
2015-10-21 22:56:16	uguuuu	what do you consider mainstream when it comes to music?
2015-10-21 22:56:17	spooky	last record i found was psychadellic muisic from vietnam. and i recently compiled some german experimental synthpop to mp3
2015-10-21 22:56:38	indeedwatson	uguuuu: most stuff that most people like
2015-10-21 22:56:47	indeedwatson	uguuuu: just think of r/movies in terms of music
2015-10-21 22:57:27	indeedwatson	no regard for anything that's old, rehashes of cliches, over-hype, etc
2015-10-21 22:57:30	spooky	uguuu: anything like red hot chilli peppers, jay z, radiohead, the entire shoegaze genre, 98% of music reviewed by pitchfork
2015-10-21 22:57:49	indeedwatson	fucking taylor swift and kanye west
2015-10-21 22:58:04	spooky	haha i hate kanye west as a human being. i never listened to his album
2015-10-21 22:58:13	spooky	also idon't know taylor swift's music
2015-10-21 22:58:16	spooky	i never listened to her
2015-10-21 22:58:34	indeedwatson	im actually amused by his persona but im convinced it's the only reason people like him
2015-10-21 22:58:37	uguuuu	is it for reasons of quality or craft that you don't like mainstream music?
2015-10-21 22:59:17	spooky	uguuu: usually a little of both. i'm kind of interested in unique perspectives rather than celebrating the same perspective to encourage/entertain masses.
2015-10-21 22:59:21	indeedwatson	because of what I stated above :p
2015-10-21 22:59:37	spooky	i don't mind craft
2015-10-21 22:59:43	spooky	i like some music that isn't done well
2015-10-21 22:59:47	spooky	as long as it's interesting
2015-10-21 23:00:01	indeedwatson	people don't really know music, they just get a tune stuck and pay attention to lyrics
2015-10-21 23:00:07	spooky	most mainstream stuff is record with the best studio equiptment and very high session musicians
2015-10-21 23:00:21	indeedwatson	and whether the intruments and sonority fit their criteria of what is "cool"
2015-10-21 23:00:36	spooky	but it lacks the creativity that makes me smile. sometimes you can get that with a band playing with homemade instruments
2015-10-21 23:00:48	spooky	because it forces them to find a creative way to be entertaining or engaging
2015-10-21 23:01:25	indeedwatson	i kinda feel that there's nothing new, in pure musical terms
2015-10-21 23:01:58	indeedwatson	 but i also can enjoy listening to music that i don't think is very good music
2015-10-21 23:02:02	spooky	probably not. but i still find stuff i think is new. maybe it uses intruments i never imagined being used together
2015-10-21 23:02:08	spooky	or very bizarre concepts
2015-10-21 23:02:15	spooky	theres really nothing 100% new
2015-10-21 23:02:22	spooky	but there's always interesting ideas :)
2015-10-21 23:02:35	uguuuu	personally i don't feel that a majority of people liking it is sufficient to dismiss this category of "mainstream"
2015-10-21 23:02:35	indeedwatson	yeah but to me that's like a movie with a typical structure and new FX
2015-10-21 23:03:06	spooky	uguuu: i listen to some mainstream stuff. i just don't download it
2015-10-21 23:03:13	spooky	but i like some mainstream music a lot
2015-10-21 23:03:22	indeedwatson	uguuuu: imo mainstream music gets to be mainstream because it is a product designed for massive audiences
2015-10-21 23:03:27	spooky	i love yoko ono. she's kinda mainstream now, but she was very indie in the 60s
2015-10-21 23:03:37	indeedwatson	oh lord
2015-10-21 23:03:44	indeedwatson	i hate yoko ono
2015-10-21 23:03:48	spooky	i love hner
2015-10-21 23:03:50	spooky	her
2015-10-21 23:03:55	spooky	i think i can even marry her
2015-10-21 23:04:00	spooky	she used to be crazy
2015-10-21 23:04:08	indeedwatson	"used to be"
2015-10-21 23:04:23	spooky	yeah. she was in a mental instution
2015-10-21 23:04:31	spooky	and her first husband was either killed or committed suicide
2015-10-21 23:04:34	spooky	she wanted to do the same
2015-10-21 23:04:39	spooky	then she met lennon
2015-10-21 23:04:48	spooky	and she started making some really fucking amazing music <3
2015-10-21 23:04:54	indeedwatson	and she's famous only cause of lennon :p
2015-10-21 23:05:00	indeedwatson	you mean screaming
2015-10-21 23:05:01	indeedwatson	haha
2015-10-21 23:05:03	spooky	oh sure
2015-10-21 23:05:04	spooky	yes
2015-10-21 23:05:07	spooky	i love her screaming
2015-10-21 23:05:11	spooky	her music wasn't pop
2015-10-21 23:05:15	spooky	i said she was indie
2015-10-21 23:05:18	spooky	in her beginning
2015-10-21 23:05:22	spooky	she did everything herself
2015-10-21 23:05:32	spooky	and she wasn't good. her voice is very scretchy
2015-10-21 23:05:34	spooky	but i like that
2015-10-21 23:05:44	spooky	i said all this stuff
2015-10-21 23:05:51	spooky	i don't have to listen to 100% perfect quality
2015-10-21 23:06:06	spooky	i love her perspectives
2015-10-21 23:06:08	indeedwatson	me neither, but im talking about the music itself, not the recording quality
2015-10-21 23:06:23	spooky	me too
2015-10-21 23:06:28	spooky	i enjoy her music
2015-10-21 23:06:33	spooky	even herr recording wasn't perfect
2015-10-21 23:06:36	spooky	but it suited her music
2015-10-21 23:07:06	indeedwatson	eh
2015-10-21 23:07:58	spooky	she's kinda anti-pop but in a poppy way
2015-10-21 23:09:12	indeedwatson	well i guess both pop and anti pop is why i dislike most modern music
2015-10-21 23:10:07	spooky	i like anti pop
2015-10-21 23:10:34	spooky	if i made music there are many people i'd wanna work with, but #1 would be yoko ono
2015-10-21 23:12:03	spooky	well, gotta go now. gnite everyone
2015-10-21 23:12:07	spooky	thanks for t he chat
2015-10-21 23:12:43	indeedwatson	seeya
2015-10-21 23:13:30	tomflint	indeedwatson: have you ever rinsed your strawberries with salt water?
2015-10-21 23:14:33	indeedwatson	mm nope
2015-10-21 23:14:40	tomflint	do it up
2015-10-21 23:14:49	tomflint	you want the salt water to be sweet
2015-10-21 23:14:55	indeedwatson	i had them with sugar, strawberry yogurt, almonds, and peanuts
2015-10-21 23:15:07	tomflint	nuts 'n' gum
2015-10-21 23:15:12	indeedwatson	so i put salt and sugar in water and wash them there?
2015-10-21 23:15:19	tomflint	nah, just salt
2015-10-21 23:15:34	indeedwatson	why did you say sweet then
2015-10-21 23:16:00	uguuuu	cause of the sugar from the strawberries?
2015-10-21 23:16:09	tomflint	salt will taste sweet at a certain level
2015-10-21 23:16:19	tomflint	its a sign that you've hit the perfect amount
2015-10-21 23:16:35	tomflint	nah, even salt in water -- like, if you're going to rinse your mouth or anything.
2015-10-21 23:16:49	uguuuu	can't say i've experienced that
2015-10-21 23:16:49	tomflint	if its salty, you've got too much. If it's sweet, it's perfect
2015-10-21 23:16:53	indeedwatson	me neither
2015-10-21 23:18:02	indeedwatson	 tomflint you only use 5g salt for 1kg of flour??
2015-10-21 23:18:49	tomflint	yeah
2015-10-21 23:18:52	tomflint	salt kills yeast
2015-10-21 23:19:07	indeedwatson	i put 20g and it feels like it's not enough
2015-10-21 23:19:15	tomflint	and really, if you want to go pro, put the salt in second to last
2015-10-21 23:19:44	indeedwatson	but how do you make it not taste bland?
2015-10-21 23:19:50	tomflint	which dough calculator are you using?
2015-10-21 23:20:28	indeedwatson	the recipe i linked earlier
2015-10-21 23:20:30	indeedwatson	http://slice.seriouseats.com/archives/2012/07/the-pizza-lab-three-doughs-to-know.html
2015-10-21 23:20:54	tomflint	20g is fine -- you want to keep it below 3%
2015-10-21 23:21:04	indeedwatson	tho i;ve used 15-20g before knowing that recipe
2015-10-21 23:21:19	tomflint	just so long as you're getting a good rise
2015-10-21 23:21:38	tomflint	my toppings are salty though --
2015-10-21 23:21:38	indeedwatson	yeah, i can smell the fermentation a lot after one day in the fridge
2015-10-21 23:21:54	tomflint	i mainly use prosciutto, sundried olives, etc
2015-10-21 23:22:03	tomflint	I also season the pie with salt and pepper
2015-10-21 23:22:13	indeedwatson	when?
2015-10-21 23:22:14	tomflint	but it also depends on the type of salt you're using
2015-10-21 23:22:21	tomflint	like, never use table salt for anything..
2015-10-21 23:22:28	tomflint	http://www.pizzamaking.com/dough-calculator.html
2015-10-21 23:22:28		[ http://is.gd/an9Rfv ]
2015-10-21 23:22:31	indeedwatson	i don't use much in terms of toppings usually
2015-10-21 23:22:48	indeedwatson	ugh i don't have flash installed
2015-10-21 23:22:56	tomflint	ha. one sec then

2015-10-21 23:23:27		[ http://is.gd/hQTMkI ]
2015-10-21 23:24:03	tomflint	when you're making dough, its best to mix the salt in second to last, just before the oil --
2015-10-21 23:24:12	tomflint	but go with whatever yields the result you like
2015-10-21 23:24:20	indeedwatson	about the yeast... it comes in little envelopes of 15g
2015-10-21 23:24:24	indeedwatson	or 10g
2015-10-21 23:24:39	indeedwatson	i rarely use oil
2015-10-21 23:24:44	indeedwatson	or sugar
2015-10-21 23:24:46	tomflint	I don't either
2015-10-21 23:24:56	indeedwatson	i might experiment with that later on
2015-10-21 23:24:59	tomflint	but I'm always messing with different recipes
2015-10-21 23:25:05	indeedwatson	yes me too
2015-10-21 23:25:11	indeedwatson	my mom sometimes puts milk even
2015-10-21 23:25:18	tomflint	here's a bad photo of some other pizza -- http://i.imgur.com/r5B6PDe.jpg
2015-10-21 23:25:44	indeedwatson	i'll try to find my bad photo of the bbq pizza
2015-10-21 23:26:08	tomflint	I used to make BBQ pizza all the time
2015-10-21 23:26:21	tomflint	it works well

2015-10-21 23:28:42	tomflint	that cutting style is my own too -- I saw it in a dream
2015-10-21 23:28:56	indeedwatson	hah
2015-10-21 23:29:05	indeedwatson	my dream is to have a brick oven
2015-10-21 23:29:09	tomflint	I do a lot of problem solving and stuff in dreams
2015-10-21 23:29:11	indeedwatson	do you use a pizza stone?
2015-10-21 23:29:17	tomflint	baking steel
2015-10-21 23:29:22	tomflint	its better than a stone
2015-10-21 23:29:43	indeedwatson	yeah i read that, but i don't know where to get one, and it's probably expensive
2015-10-21 23:29:52	tomflint	do you live in a decent city?
2015-10-21 23:30:17	tomflint	http://www.kozknowshomes.com/2013/07/diy-baking-steel.html -- call a local fabricator and get one cut. Clean it, and you're good to go
2015-10-21 23:30:18		[ http://is.gd/TdB0v2 ]
2015-10-21 23:30:21	tomflint	its about $50
2015-10-21 23:30:23	indeedwatson	i likve in argentina...
2015-10-21 23:30:26	indeedwatson	so no
2015-10-21 23:30:35	tomflint	you should have someone near you who can do it
2015-10-21 23:31:24	indeedwatson	i'll look into it
2015-10-21 23:31:28	tomflint	http://www.cinter.com.ar/ ?
2015-10-21 23:33:14	indeedwatson	doesn't look like they'd sell a small bit of metal to a regular person
2015-10-21 23:33:31	tomflint	call 'em up. They might even have some scrap they'll give you
2015-10-21 23:33:35	tomflint	its such a small piece
2015-10-21 23:34:10	indeedwatson	i have a bit of trouble with the stretching sometimes
2015-10-21 23:35:24	tomflint	you need a little more water in your dough then
2015-10-21 23:35:50	indeedwatson	i did 600ml per 1kg flour last time
2015-10-21 23:36:05	indeedwatson	maybe it wasn't out of the fridge long enough
2015-10-21 23:36:33	tomflint	the guy that wrote the pizza bible did an ok talk at Google the other day

2015-10-21 23:43:48	tomflint	do you have a computer that's always on?
2015-10-21 23:44:10	indeedwatson	no
2015-10-21 23:44:42	indeedwatson	it's on most of the day if im home
2015-10-21 23:44:46	indeedwatson	but i turn it off at night
2015-10-21 23:45:43	Carson	my parents like to go to this chain called Brixx
2015-10-21 23:46:00	Carson	pizza chain, but I'm not a fan at all
2015-10-21 23:46:19	Carson	I don't mind the crust but everything else is pretty boring to me
2015-10-21 23:46:23	indeedwatson	do you know what empanadas are?
2015-10-21 23:46:39	tomflint	yup
2015-10-21 23:46:52	Carson	so much bread
2015-10-21 23:47:34	indeedwatson	they're the only food that i like as much as pizza
2015-10-21 23:47:54	indeedwatson	do you cook Carson ?
2015-10-21 23:48:02	Carson	yes
2015-10-21 23:48:09	Carson	but I must say not very well
2015-10-21 23:48:25	indeedwatson	heh
2015-10-21 23:48:28	Carson	and I'm very limited with shopping ie lack of income
2015-10-21 23:48:33	indeedwatson	me too
2015-10-21 23:49:00	Carson	I've been making tacos the last two days
2015-10-21 23:49:11	indeedwatson	usually i have pizza with just sauce and mozarella, unless i hangout with friends and we buy lots of bacon
2015-10-21 23:49:20	Carson	and every week i try to make a big batch of brown rice and black beans
2015-10-21 23:49:55	indeedwatson	i try to eat meat every day and it's quite expensive
2015-10-21 23:50:15	tomflint	Carson: you can eat for cheap if you shop at the farm and the butcher
2015-10-21 23:50:18	tomflint	avoid grocery stores
2015-10-21 23:50:26	Carson	I cook chicken breast and thighs regularly also
2015-10-21 23:50:47	Carson	yeah that's true
2015-10-21 23:50:54	tomflint	proteins at the grocery store are often 3x as much as the butcher for an inferior meat
2015-10-21 23:51:20	indeedwatson	yeah but even there it's more expensive than carbs
2015-10-21 23:51:28	indeedwatson	stupid cheap carbs
2015-10-21 23:51:44	tomflint	skip carbs
2015-10-21 23:51:53	tomflint	have some, but you don't need a lot
2015-10-21 23:52:16	indeedwatson	im saying they're cheap :p
2015-10-21 23:52:27	indeedwatson	i try to eat above 100g protein
2015-10-21 23:54:17	indeedwatson	my mom sometimes make cake so it's hard to resist carbs
2015-10-21 23:54:58	tomflint	yeah, carbs aren't all bad --- just balance it out with protein
2015-10-21 23:55:52	indeedwatson	i can't wait to bulk again
2015-10-21 23:55:56	tomflint	haha
2015-10-22 00:18:16	Carson	it's quiet now
2015-10-22 00:18:31	Carson	really been liking Naan a lot more recently
2015-10-22 00:25:54	Carson	tomflint so is Junun just PTA playing with a drone?
2015-10-22 00:37:52	tomflint	Carson: most of it.
2015-10-22 00:37:53	tomflint	haha
2015-10-22 00:38:09	tomflint	I loved it though
2015-10-22 00:38:44	Carson	i'm 20 minutes in
2015-10-22 00:39:29	Carson	do you have a rip of this film yet?
2015-10-22 00:40:22	tomflint	nope. I watched it on mubi
2015-10-22 00:41:23	Carson	yeah I haven't seen any rips yet, I imagine there will be whenever it gets a wide distribution
2015-10-22 00:42:30	tomflint	its great though
2015-10-22 00:42:34	tomflint	the music is fantastic
2015-10-22 00:42:43	tomflint	its not PTA or Jonny Greenwood though --
2015-10-22 00:43:03	tomflint	its just an indian band jamming and dealing with the local conditions
2015-10-22 00:43:43	Carson	i love that he's doing a lot of small projects like this right now
2015-10-22 00:43:52	tomflint	which others has he done?
2015-10-22 00:44:16	Carson	well he's also been doing some of the Joanna Newsome videos
2015-10-22 00:44:31	tomflint	oh yeah ---

2015-10-22 18:37:48	indeedwatson	AJ44: the series A Story of Film
2015-10-22 18:38:00	AJ44	yeah i started on that, but gave up halfway
2015-10-22 18:38:03	AJ44	i can't remember why
2015-10-22 18:38:55	Carson	I finished it around the time it was release a year or so ago
2015-10-22 18:39:29	Carson	also just think the novelty of the series wears off if you watch it too quickly
2015-10-22 18:40:38	AJ44	yeah
2015-10-22 18:40:45	AJ44	maybe it would be good to watch and episode at a time or something
2015-10-22 18:41:11	Carson	yeah I would say so
2015-10-22 18:41:20	Carson	also take notes about each episode
2015-10-22 18:41:47	Carson	to keep your attention, because the more you watch the more likely you will start losing attention
2015-10-22 18:42:12	indeedwatson	good point

2015-10-22 18:43:30	indeedwatson	hi tomflint 
2015-10-22 18:43:32	Carson	i tend to multitask after a while of watching shows
2015-10-22 18:43:47	Carson	anyone figure out why everyone was a guest?
2015-10-22 18:43:58	indeedwatson	Carson: i was getting distracted by irc watching ep 4 last night :p so im gonna watch it again today
2015-10-22 18:44:08	tomflint	did that happen to everyone or just people on bouncers?
2015-10-22 18:44:09	indeedwatson	i don't think i was guest
2015-10-22 18:44:41	Carson	idk
2015-10-22 18:45:12	Carson	spooky got guest-ed
2015-10-22 18:46:12	spooky	i did
2015-10-22 18:46:18	AJ44	do you guys watch tv shows as well?
2015-10-22 18:46:52	Carson	i do
2015-10-22 18:46:57	Carson	most people do
2015-10-22 18:47:08	spooky	i do
2015-10-22 18:51:27	AJ44	i haven't watched any :(
2015-10-22 18:51:30	AJ44	maybe i'll start on narcos
2015-10-22 18:51:42	AJ44	but i know that if I stat watching tv shows again, i'll neglect my readings
2015-10-22 18:56:47	indeedwatson	i rarely do nowadays, except rick & morty
2015-10-22 18:57:28	AJ44	haha i watched a couple of those
2015-10-22 18:57:33	AJ44	it's funny, but i guess its not my thing
2015-10-22 18:57:39	AJ44	i wouldnt go out of my way to watch it
2015-10-22 18:58:08	AJ44	i think i'll go watch the rest of that film
2015-10-22 18:58:12	AJ44	prince of the city
2015-10-22 18:59:04	Carson	it's hard for me to watch cartoons nowadays
2015-10-22 18:59:20	Carson	I like them
2015-10-22 18:59:33	spooky	i watch few tv shows (just like movies). i try and select the ones i'll think i'll like the best then watch those all the way
2015-10-22 18:59:38	Carson	I just feel like I have to be high or intoxicated to truly enjoy
2015-10-22 19:00:07	Carson	I have a lot of cartoons downloaded when that time comes
2015-10-22 19:00:24	spooky	do you mean present day cartoons or cartoons from any decade at your current age
2015-10-22 19:00:25	Carson	like Adventure time is hard for me to enjoy sober
2015-10-22 19:00:32	Carson	mmm idk
2015-10-22 19:00:37	Carson	I'm sure there are exceptions
2015-10-22 19:00:50	Carson	but almost every decade
2015-10-22 19:01:04	Carson	it's hard for me to devote long term time to a cartoon
2015-10-22 19:02:03	uguuuu	it's okay, we're adults, we don't have to enjoy cartoons that much!
2015-10-22 19:02:13	indeedwatson	pls
2015-10-22 19:02:31	indeedwatson	r&m is better than 98% stuff that's on tv
2015-10-22 19:02:58	uguuuu	:D
2015-10-22 19:03:07	Carson	I'm not saying I don't enjoy them, it can just be difficult long term
2015-10-22 19:03:08	spooky	haha i also watch cartoons, but i prefer the older ones :)
2015-10-22 19:03:33	Carson	I have a lot my favorite cartoons as a kid downloaded
2015-10-22 19:03:42	spooky	me too
2015-10-22 19:04:05	Carson	which older ones are you referring to?
2015-10-22 19:04:16	spooky	mine are mostly 80s toons
2015-10-22 19:04:36	spooky	thundercats, visionaries, m.a.s.k. johnny quest
2015-10-22 19:04:47	spooky	wait... the johnny quest i have is the 60s version
2015-10-22 19:04:56	spooky	flash gordon
2015-10-22 19:05:01	spooky	spiderman
2015-10-22 19:05:15	spooky	pole position
2015-10-22 19:08:40	Carson	i've got a lot of 90s stuff
2015-10-22 19:09:40	spooky	like?
2015-10-22 19:10:41	Carson	Reboot, Batman Animated Series, Animaniacs, Dragonball, X-Men Animated
2015-10-22 19:10:53	tomflint	Carson: we all know why you like X-Men...
2015-10-22 19:11:01	Carson	lol
2015-10-22 19:11:10	Carson	actually I didn't watch it that much as a kid
2015-10-22 19:11:16	tomflint	dirty, dirty Jean...
2015-10-22 19:11:18	spooky	i think the only 90s toon i have is C.O.P.S.
2015-10-22 19:11:31	Carson	which is odd, I started watching it more as an adult
2015-10-22 19:11:32	spooky	i might have gummi bears but i doubt it
2015-10-22 19:12:18	Carson	could anyone argue for the best cartoon show of the 90s?
2015-10-22 19:12:34	Carson	I would vote for Batman the Animated Series
2015-10-22 19:12:42	uguuuu	I say Batman as well~
2015-10-22 19:20:42	spooky	i wouldn't be able to vote because i'm unfamiliar with 90s cartoons
2015-10-22 19:25:21	tomflint	BAS is amazing
2015-10-22 19:25:34	tomflint	they developed that dark deco style
2015-10-22 19:26:45	tomflint	its brilliant because they animated everything on black paper with lighter inks
2015-10-22 19:27:02	tomflint	not only would it save time, but it kept everything ultra rich
2015-10-22 19:45:28	indeedwatson	i tried watching the Batman series a few years ago but I wasn't amazed
2015-10-22 19:52:40	spooky	the only batman i watched was the movie with jack nicolson as the joker
2015-10-22 19:58:00	tomflint	but indeedwatson, you don't like anything!
2015-10-22 19:58:19	tomflint	for its time it was a revolutionary cartoon
2015-10-22 20:00:50	tomflint	have you guys watched Call Me Lucky on Netflix?
2015-10-22 20:01:10	indeedwatson	i liked it at the time
2015-10-22 20:01:22	tomflint	ha. its tough to rewatch old cartoons
2015-10-22 20:01:45	indeedwatson	depends, space ghost coast to coast still cracks me up
2015-10-22 20:01:51	spooky	is call me lucky a tv show or a movie?
2015-10-22 20:02:20	tomflint	spooky: its a documentary / movie -- its about Barry Crimmins, a semi-legendary comic in the NY scene
2015-10-22 20:02:27	Carson	I'm watching coast to coast right now
2015-10-22 20:02:50	tomflint	he was one of the first comics to remove the goofy comedy from his set, only to get ultra political
2015-10-22 20:02:52	spooky	haven't watched it
2015-10-22 20:03:00	spooky	i really want to watch 'beasts of no nation'
2015-10-22 20:03:03	spooky	i keep putting it off
2015-10-22 20:03:18	tomflint	I started it last night -- but I couldn't watch a child soldier movie before bed
2015-10-22 20:03:31	tomflint	instead, I watched something which ended up being equally disturbing at times
2015-10-22 20:03:35	spooky	yeah that can be tough
2015-10-22 20:03:46	spooky	also i heard it's unflinching
2015-10-22 20:03:50	tomflint	it's the child abuse movie festival at tomflint's place
2015-10-22 20:04:24	tomflint	Beasts is sooooo well done, especially when you consider the budget they were on
2015-10-22 20:05:02	spooky	yeah it looks really good from the trailers
2015-10-22 20:05:10	spooky	and i like idris elba
2015-10-22 20:05:12	tomflint	Idris Elba is amazing
2015-10-22 20:05:54	spooky	he is
2015-10-22 20:06:39	tomflint	he's so cool too. When he's in the US, these hard kids will come up and say 'yo String...'
2015-10-22 20:06:46	tomflint	and he gets right into character
2015-10-22 20:07:00	indeedwatson	hah
2015-10-22 20:08:11	spooky	hehe
2015-10-22 20:09:35	tomflint	its funny, if you watch Stringer's death, he twitches his thumb
2015-10-22 20:10:26	tomflint	spooky: have you seen it?
2015-10-22 20:10:50	indeedwatson	i don't think he's watched The Wire iirc
2015-10-22 20:11:16	spooky	tomflint: seen which film?
2015-10-22 20:12:30	tomflint	spooky: you haven't watched The Wire?!
2015-10-22 20:13:36	spooky	never watched it
2015-10-22 20:13:42	tomflint	good Lord
2015-10-22 20:23:08	spooky	lol
2015-10-22 20:23:38	spooky	i don't even know what the wire is about
2015-10-22 20:26:28	tomflint	its a story of the urban crime environment in America and how the 'war on drugs' isn't working because of the various systems involved
2015-10-22 20:26:42	tomflint	so the first season is the police and the drug trade -- mainly one large, dominant crew...
2015-10-22 20:27:10	tomflint	the second season gets into the ports and how the unions and share a piece of the puzzle
2015-10-22 20:27:26	tomflint	season 3 is the politicians, 4 is children and the education system..
2015-10-22 20:27:31	tomflint	then 5 tackles the media
2015-10-22 20:27:47	tomflint	but its the story of a city as the main character, so you have ongoing stories that continue from season to season...
2015-10-22 20:27:58	tomflint	its the ultimate in world building.
2015-10-22 20:29:01	spooky	actually sounds interesting. not sure why i haven't watched it. i guess it just never came up even amongst peers who enjoy the same shows as i do
2015-10-22 20:29:03	tomflint	most of the writers for the show were journalists and authors before screen writers --- and the honest truth is that you'll be hard-pressed to find a more accurate, well-told description of what's happening in these oppressed inner-cities
2015-10-22 20:29:18	tomflint	you're lucky to watch it now. There are 1080p rips
2015-10-22 20:29:56	tomflint	the first season was shot 4:3 on film and David Simon refused to do HD for years --- but then he finally came around. The result is some of the best (if *the* best) television you'll watch
2015-10-22 20:31:08	tomflint	If you're downloading, also get the DVD rips from thepiratebay. They have the audio commentary ---
2015-10-22 20:31:09	spooky	hrm... i;ll check it out. though "best television" am not sure :D
2015-10-22 20:31:46	tomflint	it doesn't wank like Game of Thrones and those other things
2015-10-22 20:32:00	tomflint	this is pure storytelling --- no cliffhangers to trick you into watching more
2015-10-22 20:32:03	spooky	didn't like game of thrones
2015-10-22 20:32:10	tomflint	you watch more because you're invested in the story and characters
2015-10-22 20:32:12	tomflint	I hated GoT.
2015-10-22 20:32:18	spooky	my favorite tv shows (like movies) are mostly from before 2000
2015-10-22 20:32:22	tomflint	boobs and dragons.
2015-10-22 20:32:24	spooky	i think only a few are from the 90s
2015-10-22 20:32:48	spooky	i'd be curious what tv shows you like the best
2015-10-22 20:33:08	spooky	just to get an idea of where you're coming from when you say "some of the best television you'll watch"
2015-10-22 20:33:33	spooky	btw: found the wire. either HDTV or Web-DL
2015-10-22 20:33:45	tomflint	here's a list I made off the top of my head https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BWdtF3WJRKkOhiVb1yRAhji8YgZkG0z6wPnvRKGEaTg/edit?usp=sharing
2015-10-22 20:33:47		[ http://is.gd/c5d7dK ]
2015-10-22 20:33:48	tomflint	go with the web-DL
2015-10-22 20:33:54	uguuuu	there are blu-rays out now though
2015-10-22 20:33:58	spooky	3 seasons right?
2015-10-22 20:34:01	uguuuu	should be much better quality
2015-10-22 20:34:02	tomflint	5 seasons
2015-10-22 20:34:15	tomflint	the 1080p ones are ~2GB each
2015-10-22 20:34:38	spooky	ah okay
2015-10-22 20:34:42	spooky	found all 5
2015-10-22 20:35:04	spooky	Web-DL 1080p h264 23.35g/season
2015-10-22 20:35:27	uguuuu	just sayin'... if you want "best" quality
2015-10-22 20:36:06	spooky	writing quality > picture quality imo
2015-10-22 20:36:19	tomflint	the Wire on Bluray is only $118 too --
2015-10-22 20:36:26	spooky	but i'll get the web-dl
2015-10-22 20:36:43	tomflint	VENUE has 6gb rips! haha
2015-10-22 20:36:56	tomflint	that's crazy
2015-10-22 20:37:11	tomflint	they're french though
2015-10-22 20:37:22	uguuuu	what's venue?
2015-10-22 20:37:29	tomflint	a release group
2015-10-22 20:37:30	spooky	tomflint: interesting list. but only 3 shows from the 90s
2015-10-22 20:37:40	spooky	you never watched any 80s,70s or 60s tv?
2015-10-22 20:37:47	tomflint	I don't like sitcoms
2015-10-22 20:38:03	spooky	there were written dramas before the 90s too
2015-10-22 20:38:05	tomflint	but those are recent shows --
2015-10-22 20:38:06	indeedwatson	The Wire is pretty consistently considered the best TV show, if you take away the common IMDb/Reddit hype for GoT or Breaking Bad
2015-10-22 20:38:22	tomflint	but I didn't watch a lot of TV until about 2008
2015-10-22 20:38:30	spooky	oh wow
2015-10-22 20:38:30	tomflint	even later, actually.
2015-10-22 20:38:37	spooky	i actually watched more tv in the 90s than now
2015-10-22 20:38:46	tomflint	how old are you?
2015-10-22 20:38:52	spooky	28
2015-10-22 20:39:00	tomflint	I've got 7 years on you --
2015-10-22 20:39:09	Carson	imdb ratings are shit
2015-10-22 20:39:17	tomflint	I wasn't home a lot in the 90s
2015-10-22 20:39:20	indeedwatson	Carson: i know
2015-10-22 20:39:23	spooky	btw: tomflint: i loved danger 5 :)
2015-10-22 20:39:29	tomflint	so good, right!
2015-10-22 20:39:33	indeedwatson	danger 5 is great
2015-10-22 20:39:39	indeedwatson	i prefer darkplace tho
2015-10-22 20:39:40	spooky	Carson: kinda like me. i'm not home too much now
2015-10-22 20:40:00	spooky	i didn't like darkplace that much. had a few laughs but danger 5 season 1 is insanely amazing
2015-10-22 20:40:06	spooky	season 2 is hit and miss
2015-10-22 20:40:18	indeedwatson	oh wow, breaking bad is first
2015-10-22 20:40:19	spooky	imo perfect comedy
2015-10-22 20:40:29	indeedwatson	i liked breaking bad but not THAT much
2015-10-22 20:40:44	indeedwatson	the perfect comedy is arrested development for me
2015-10-22 20:41:07	spooky	<indeedwatson> The Wire is pretty consistently considered the best TV show <-- i've noticed this, but the same people don't seem to acknowledge television existed before the 90s
2015-10-22 20:41:46	indeedwatson	television wasn't generally given much artistic freedom before imo
2015-10-22 20:41:54	uguuuu	because it's also widely considered that a cultural shift took place in the tv landscape
2015-10-22 20:41:58	indeedwatson	the history of tv is different from the history of movies
2015-10-22 20:42:02	Carson	what's the best tv before 2000s?
2015-10-22 20:42:04	spooky	indeedwatson: haha. i'd argue there was more freedom
2015-10-22 20:42:11	spooky	you can't make a show like twilight zone today
2015-10-22 20:42:12	uguuuu	the started around twin peaks and reached its zenith with the sopranos
2015-10-22 20:42:21	indeedwatson	spooky: um, Black Mirror
2015-10-22 20:42:33	tomflint	Black Mirror was awesome
2015-10-22 20:42:35	spooky	never seen black mirror
2015-10-22 20:42:40	indeedwatson	could you make tv without commercial breaks before the 90s?
2015-10-22 20:42:43	tomflint	I've been watching Hitchcock Presents lately
2015-10-22 20:42:53	tomflint	indeedwatson: some boxes could
2015-10-22 20:42:55	uguuuu	well the BBC did
2015-10-22 20:42:58	indeedwatson	could you make a long arc story spanning several seasons?
2015-10-22 20:43:03	tomflint	the BBC is the best.
2015-10-22 20:43:11	spooky	indeedwatson: on hbo you could. and lots of english dramas did
2015-10-22 20:43:36	spooky	indeedwatson: yes (long arc story spanning several seasons)
2015-10-22 20:43:37	indeedwatson	spooky: well Black Mirror is similar to twilight zone, so that disproves your point :p
2015-10-22 20:43:57	spooky	usually you'd have a few episodes go away from the main story, but there was 1 main story and a few "side" stories
2015-10-22 20:44:27	spooky	indeedwatson: there are many shows like twilight zone, but there is only 1 twilight zone ;)
2015-10-22 20:44:45	indeedwatson	my point is that it could be made today
2015-10-22 20:45:04	indeedwatson	we could say the same about Band of Brothers or several landmarks in tv history
2015-10-22 20:45:12	indeedwatson	that there was only 1
2015-10-22 20:45:15	tomflint	spooky: if you watch Black Mirror, there will be a point where you'll say 'fuck this, this isn't worth it...' --- but hold out. It pays off
2015-10-22 20:45:27	spooky	indeedwatson: lol. black mirror is english isn;t it?
2015-10-22 20:45:28	indeedwatson	tomflint: are you talking about the 1st ep? haha
2015-10-22 20:45:33	indeedwatson	yeah
2015-10-22 20:45:42	spooky	okay
2015-10-22 20:45:49	indeedwatson	written by Charlie Brooker
2015-10-22 20:45:50	spooky	in united states, it's impossible today
2015-10-22 20:45:55	spooky	maybe on netflix or amazon
2015-10-22 20:45:58	spooky	but not on tv
2015-10-22 20:46:00	spooky	regular tv
2015-10-22 20:46:01	indeedwatson	who btw loces the wire :p
2015-10-22 20:46:06	indeedwatson	loves*
2015-10-22 20:47:36	indeedwatson	spooky: tell us a deep show from before the 90s that spans a big story
2015-10-22 20:47:39	indeedwatson	im curious now
2015-10-22 20:48:17	uguuuu	i think you have to be careful with the "long arc" bias, which is a modern one
2015-10-22 20:48:26	spooky	dangerous women (althought that's 91)
2015-10-22 20:48:26	uguuuu	it doesn't necessarily make for better television
2015-10-22 20:48:30	spooky	you won't find it anywhere though
2015-10-22 20:48:49	indeedwatson	uguuuu: of course not, but it's what interests me most
2015-10-22 20:49:24	spooky	good times had a story that last 1 season
2015-10-22 20:49:30	spooky	i think its between season 4-5
2015-10-22 20:49:36	spooky	its the one with janet jackson
2015-10-22 20:49:43	spooky	sorry not sure which season
2015-10-22 20:49:50	spooky	but the arc lasts the full season
2015-10-22 20:50:28	tomflint	indeedwatson: yeah -- that first episode is the cost of entry.
2015-10-22 20:50:29	spooky	dangerous women is 2 1/2 seasons of 5 long stories (each similar but slightly different)
2015-10-22 20:51:09	indeedwatson	it's a remake apparently
2015-10-22 20:51:19	tomflint	Dangerous Women sounds like those dirty 'women's prison' novels --
2015-10-22 20:51:38	spooky	tomflint: dangerous women is kinda like twin peaks
2015-10-22 20:51:43	indeedwatson	you mean orange is the new black?
2015-10-22 20:51:45	indeedwatson	heh
2015-10-22 20:51:45	tomflint	ha
2015-10-22 20:51:59	tomflint	Orange is the New Should-Be-Ended
2015-10-22 20:52:13	spooky	you know how twin peaks has comedy, drama, surreal soap opera type romance, etc.
2015-10-22 20:52:22	tomflint	si
2015-10-22 20:52:26	spooky	its like that
2015-10-22 20:52:34	spooky	but not as weird
2015-10-22 20:52:37	spooky	its more on the drama side
2015-10-22 20:52:40	spooky	but it has everything
2015-10-22 20:52:54	spooky	only a few episodes have the women in prison. then 1 woman is stuck in prison
2015-10-22 20:52:56	tomflint	I like Columbo
2015-10-22 20:53:09	indeedwatson	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB9oaRkAaE0
2015-10-22 20:53:11	spooky	then the rest are trying to survive outside of prison. but you find out why they were in prison...
2015-10-22 20:53:15	spooky	it just goes on and on
2015-10-22 20:53:15	tomflint	I think I like 70s and some 80s more
2015-10-22 20:53:21	spooky	yeah
2015-10-22 20:53:25	tomflint	oh wait, mostly 80s
2015-10-22 20:53:27	spooky	70s and 80s shows were fucking amazing
2015-10-22 20:53:30	tomflint	Hill Street Blues OWNS
2015-10-22 20:53:38	spooky	kojak
2015-10-22 20:53:43	spooky	streets of san francisco
2015-10-22 20:53:46	spooky	charlies angels

2015-10-22 20:53:54	tomflint	Streets is sooooo good

2015-10-22 20:54:14	indeedwatson	charlies angels is your favorite tv show?
2015-10-22 20:54:24	spooky	i never said it was my favorite
2015-10-22 20:54:33	uguuuu	i think he said twilight zone was :v
2015-10-22 20:54:34	spooky	i just said those are some of t he shows i enjoy
2015-10-22 20:54:37	spooky	nope
2015-10-22 20:54:40	spooky	i never said my favorite
2015-10-22 20:54:44	spooky	i only mentioned shows i enjoy
2015-10-22 20:54:45	spooky	haha
2015-10-22 20:54:47	uguuuu	better pick a story and stick with it!!
2015-10-22 20:54:54	indeedwatson	you did say best tv ever
2015-10-22 20:55:16	spooky	<spooky> best tv EVER imo <-- i meant this: <spooky> 70s and 80s shows were fucking amazing
2015-10-22 20:55:23	spooky	i meant in general
2015-10-22 20:55:30	spooky	the tv was good overral
2015-10-22 20:55:33	tomflint	have you guys watched Hitchcock Presents?
2015-10-22 20:55:34	indeedwatson	im watching this and it feels a bit too cheesy
2015-10-22 20:55:40	indeedwatson	no
2015-10-22 20:55:46	tomflint	its sooooooo gooood
2015-10-22 20:55:50	spooky	not the best show. but if i picked a decade, i would say 70s had so many good shows
2015-10-22 20:55:58	tomflint	kind of cheesy, but there are 30+ episodes per season..
2015-10-22 20:55:59	spooky	<tomflint> have you guys watched Hitchcock Presents? <-- of course
2015-10-22 20:56:08	spooky	that was 59
2015-10-22 20:56:11	tomflint	ha. you don't have to quote
2015-10-22 20:56:14	spooky	or 57
2015-10-22 20:56:27	spooky	sorry. very much used to doing that
2015-10-22 20:56:31	tomflint	I love how Hitchcock disses the sponsor
2015-10-22 20:56:50	spooky	yeah... i loved his little introductions or between episodes he does something
2015-10-22 20:57:37	indeedwatson	yeah Dangerous Women is too cheesy for me haha
2015-10-22 20:57:53	spooky	yeah its def. not for everyone
2015-10-22 20:58:00	spooky	some episodes were too weird
2015-10-22 20:58:11	spooky	and it never got finished
2015-10-22 20:59:51	spooky	theres also lots of tv thats been forgotten to history :P
2015-10-22 21:00:06	tomflint	indeedwatson: were you watching this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45BRGjFpwok
2015-10-22 21:00:07		[ http://is.gd/xlO6WQ ]
2015-10-22 21:00:12	spooky	and most ppl when they say "best show on tv" its always an american show
2015-10-22 21:00:38	indeedwatson	tomflint: i posted the whole pilot
2015-10-22 21:00:41	tomflint	uh... this seems like a PG porn
2015-10-22 21:00:50	tomflint	I don't trust a pilot though :)
2015-10-22 21:01:05	indeedwatson	i just wanted to check how the tone was
2015-10-22 21:01:07	tomflint	have you guys ever watched Dark Shadows?
2015-10-22 21:01:15	spooky	tomflint: of course
2015-10-22 21:01:23	tomflint	I made it about 12 episodes in....
2015-10-22 21:01:32	spooky	indeedwatson: you judged the show from a few minutes on youtube?
2015-10-22 21:01:34	spooky	lol
2015-10-22 21:01:37	indeedwatson	i don't know if this is the same ep as the pilot but the plot looks the same
2015-10-22 21:01:40	tomflint	at the 6 hour mark when she said 'my first night at the mansion...' --- fuck this, I'm out
2015-10-22 21:01:54	indeedwatson	spooky: well i watched 2 minutes and it was very obvious where it was going
2015-10-22 21:02:12	spooky	indeedwatson: now you know how i feel when i don't finish movies
2015-10-22 21:02:13	indeedwatson	shirtless husband greets young blond babysitter, wife becomes suspicious
2015-10-22 21:02:15	tomflint	indeedwatson: it felt like a Harlequin novel...
2015-10-22 21:02:31	tomflint	'I'm here to look after your boys'
2015-10-22 21:02:32	indeedwatson	what's Dark Shadows?
2015-10-22 21:02:37	spooky	indeedwatson: its true it has some cheesy parts. but others are weird. others are dark. it was very mixed in genre
2015-10-22 21:02:38	tomflint	'how about my boys look after you...'
2015-10-22 21:03:22	spooky	dark shadows was a soap opera but gothic
2015-10-22 21:03:23	tomflint	indeedwatson: Dark Shadows was this ultra low-budget soap opera --- they weren't really prepared to do one episode per day, so there are a lot of funny errors
2015-10-22 21:03:27	tomflint	the acting is awful..
2015-10-22 21:03:30	spooky	like 1 very very very long romance story
2015-10-22 21:03:37	indeedwatson	i like cheesy when it's either very charming, or self aware
2015-10-22 21:03:37	tomflint	and if you pay attention, you can see scripts around the set
2015-10-22 21:04:00	indeedwatson	that sounds like it inspired darkplace
2015-10-22 21:04:15	tomflint	indeedwatson: there are also 1225 episodes
2015-10-22 21:04:29	spooky	i thought darkplace was inspired by alfred hitchcock presents or twilight zone (especially the intro)
2015-10-22 21:04:35	indeedwatson	one of the reasons i love arrested development and darkplaces it's because it uses editing and the camera itself to make humor
2015-10-22 21:04:37	spooky	only difference they work in a hospital
2015-10-22 21:04:47	indeedwatson	holy shit tomflint 
2015-10-22 21:04:53	tomflint	yeah
2015-10-22 21:05:03	indeedwatson	spooky: yeah but im sure it was also inspired by forgotten, shitty B movies and shows
2015-10-22 21:05:11	indeedwatson	oh and also by stephen king
2015-10-22 21:05:13	tomflint	I mean, some people suffer in life... those who want more will watch Dark Shadows
2015-10-22 21:05:21	indeedwatson	with garth marenghi
2015-10-22 21:05:50	tomflint	I'm going to start building a new NAS
2015-10-22 21:06:05	indeedwatson	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40nlANmQb1k&list=PLNGoBOOB2JgBtessz__66wnzBvbDaS6i-
2015-10-22 21:06:14	spooky	indeedwatson: i think some of the episodes. but the way darkplace begins is definately twilight zone. how they interrupt the show and talk about the show and problems (alfred hitchock). individual episodes are mixture of early peter jackson and absurd british humor + b-movie horror
2015-10-22 21:06:43	tomflint	My name is Victoria Winters....
2015-10-22 21:06:52	spooky	its like they mixed things they loved and made it a comedy
2015-10-22 21:06:58	tomflint	after a few episodes, you'll start saying that in your sleep
2015-10-22 21:07:19	spooky	tomflint is possessed by dark shadows
2015-10-22 21:07:20	indeedwatson	well garth's persona and horrible acting, editing and props and fx are seen constantly throughout the whole show
2015-10-22 21:07:35	tomflint	hahahha
2015-10-22 21:07:42	tomflint	this is the best instructional video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=En2XDx_m2Fk
2015-10-22 21:07:42		[ http://is.gd/OuSLQg ]
2015-10-22 21:07:42	spooky	indeedwatson: yes. thats for t he humor
2015-10-22 21:07:58	indeedwatson	tomflint: sell the wire bluray and get dark shadows in bluray when it comes out
2015-10-22 21:08:04	spooky	just how in twilight zone: the narrators persona and acting and editing are constantly good t hroughtout the show
2015-10-22 21:08:22	tomflint	indeedwatson: I can buy about 10' of rope for cheaper.
2015-10-22 21:08:31	indeedwatson	lol
2015-10-22 21:08:44	tomflint	http://www.wikihow.com/Tie-a-Noose
2015-10-22 21:08:44		[ http://is.gd/YlkH0j ]
2015-10-22 21:10:42	indeedwatson	i should get a list of best twilight zone episodes
2015-10-22 21:11:40	AJ44	jesus christ

2015-10-22 21:12:07	spooky	w00t movie?
2015-10-22 21:12:15	AJ44	Prince of the city
2015-10-22 21:12:17	uguuuu	waT moofie
2015-10-22 21:12:31	spooky	ah. never seen that one
2015-10-22 21:12:36	spooky	i thought you watched dog day
2015-10-22 21:12:39	tomflint	get your Jerry Orbach on!
2015-10-22 21:12:40	indeedwatson	tomflint: which one of those has boobs and dragons???
2015-10-22 21:12:48	AJ44	yeah, it goes outside his usual canon
2015-10-22 21:13:07	AJ44	I did: dog day afternoon, the verdict, 12 angry men, serpico
2015-10-22 21:13:11	tomflint	indeedwatson: none.
2015-10-22 21:13:22	indeedwatson	there was a time when the top tv show in imdb was Planet Earth
2015-10-22 21:13:23	AJ44	his latest with philip seymour and ethan hawke
2015-10-22 21:13:26	spooky	holy fuck. i forgot he did 12 angry men
2015-10-22 21:13:37	AJ44	yeah
2015-10-22 21:13:39	spooky	planet earth is amazing
2015-10-22 21:13:48	indeedwatson	agree
2015-10-22 21:13:48	AJ44	there's a common element to all of his movies so far
2015-10-22 21:13:57	spooky	i love the episodes about insects and birds
2015-10-22 21:13:59	AJ44	and i've seen quite a few
2015-10-22 21:14:01	indeedwatson	tho i haven't seen the last 3 episodes
2015-10-22 21:14:11	indeedwatson	i gotta get a really high quality torrent
2015-10-22 21:14:16	indeedwatson	and some drugs
2015-10-22 21:14:17	indeedwatson	lol
2015-10-22 21:14:22	indeedwatson	AJ44: which elemnt
2015-10-22 21:14:34	spooky	grity realism?
2015-10-22 21:14:34	AJ44	it usually revolves around morality
2015-10-22 21:14:45	spooky	no music
2015-10-22 21:14:51	indeedwatson	as over the top as it is I love Network
2015-10-22 21:15:02	AJ44	oh yeah i've seen that one as well
2015-10-22 21:15:10	AJ44	it's actually the one I can't tie in to the other ones as well
2015-10-22 21:15:22	AJ44	because it's an entirely different theme
2015-10-22 21:15:34	AJ44	but you could say that is about the amorality of television
2015-10-22 21:16:12	tomflint	Prince of the City is in my list now -- thanks AJ44
2015-10-22 21:16:21	tomflint	only 1558 hours to go!
2015-10-22 21:16:32	indeedwatson	i haven't even seen Serpico yet :/
2015-10-22 21:16:39	tomflint	daaaamn
2015-10-22 21:16:41	AJ44	I really think you should all give a chance to his cinema
2015-10-22 21:16:45	tomflint	Serpico will change your life
2015-10-22 21:16:49	spooky	yeah
2015-10-22 21:16:50	tomflint	you will become cooler.
2015-10-22 21:16:56	tomflint	women will find you sexually attractive
2015-10-22 21:16:58	AJ44	if you enjoyed 12 angry men, it's as if he's been doing the same film all over his career
2015-10-22 21:17:02	AJ44	serpico is amazing
2015-10-22 21:17:04	tomflint	your hair will be thicker...
2015-10-22 21:17:04	spooky	or just watching some pre 90s movies in general :)
2015-10-22 21:17:08	uguuuu	serpico is quite good
2015-10-22 21:17:09	tomflint	but your speech will suffer
2015-10-22 21:17:21	AJ44	basically serpico and prince have the same story
2015-10-22 21:17:22	indeedwatson	tomflint: more than when watching the wire?
2015-10-22 21:17:30	AJ44	but very different takes on it
2015-10-22 21:17:42	AJ44	serpico is about a clean cop, prince is about a dirty one
2015-10-22 21:17:54	AJ44	they have some parallels, and prince is grittier I would say
2015-10-22 21:17:57	indeedwatson	AJ44: have you read Lumet's book?
2015-10-22 21:18:03	AJ44	nope. is it good?
2015-10-22 21:18:09	indeedwatson	yes
2015-10-22 21:18:11	AJ44	i've read that it is mostly about filmmaking
2015-10-22 21:18:15	indeedwatson	very enjoyable
2015-10-22 21:18:28	indeedwatson	and he goes into detail about some of his movies
2015-10-22 21:18:34	indeedwatson	and how the camera work relates to the message
2015-10-22 21:18:46	AJ44	oh
2015-10-22 21:18:57	AJ44	i'm actually not very acquainted with his pre 70 work
2015-10-22 21:19:04	AJ44	and he did a couple very important films on that period
2015-10-22 21:19:06	indeedwatson	pretty much the opposite of Tarkovsky's book haha
2015-10-22 21:19:29	AJ44	i don't read much about movies
2015-10-22 21:19:36	AJ44	i've got truffaut's book, and I consult it from time to time
2015-10-22 21:19:44	tomflint	I should go as Serpico for halloween
2015-10-22 21:19:48	AJ44	haha
2015-10-22 21:19:56	AJ44	serpico is great
2015-10-22 21:20:04	AJ44	i wouldn't watch those back to back though
2015-10-22 21:20:08	tomflint	I'm not sure I want to wear that much clothing though
2015-10-22 21:20:56	AJ44	i guess lumet is one of my favorites now lol
2015-10-22 21:21:01	AJ44	i really am enchanted by his filmmaking
2015-10-22 21:21:04	tomflint	I'm putting Serpico on my rewatch list
2015-10-22 21:21:17	uguuuu	remember to watch... The Pawnbroker
2015-10-22 21:21:20	AJ44	does his book explore his filmmaking decisions?
2015-10-22 21:21:27	AJ44	I have that one downloaded! is it good?
2015-10-22 21:21:33	uguuuu	I liked it a lot
2015-10-22 21:21:35	AJ44	my film had no subtitles, so I didn't watch it yet
2015-10-22 21:21:40	indeedwatson	AJ44: yeah
2015-10-22 21:21:58	AJ44	yeah, that's his period I know the less
2015-10-22 21:22:17	AJ44	about his filmmaking, I listened to his commentary on network for half of it, and it wasn't much interesting
2015-10-22 21:22:30	AJ44	he basically mentioned his lightning choices for the scenes, which I didn't find too amusing
2015-10-22 21:22:41	uguuuu	i've got some Lumet films that I still need to see
2015-10-22 21:22:49	tomflint	http://i.imgur.com/DTTcWaL.gif
2015-10-22 21:22:53	uguuuu	verdict, fail-safe, the hill
2015-10-22 21:23:02	AJ44	i would relate dog day afternoon to network, now that I think of it
2015-10-22 21:23:26	AJ44	verdict is nice as well
2015-10-22 21:23:44	AJ44	i don't know, maybe I should write about him sometime so I can organize all his films in my head
2015-10-22 21:25:25	AJ44	anyhow, i'm sorry about all the excitement
2015-10-22 21:26:01	indeedwatson	you better be sorry, we're all deeply offended by your excitement
2015-10-22 21:26:11	indeedwatson	tomflint: is that nick nolte?
2015-10-22 21:26:32	AJ44	haha i didn't want to cut your conversation about twilight zone
2015-10-22 21:26:39	AJ44	although I have no idea what that is
2015-10-22 21:26:43	AJ44	has anyone seen the wire? the tv sho?
2015-10-22 21:27:08	indeedwatson	we talked about the wire like 10mins ago :p
2015-10-22 21:27:23	indeedwatson	scroll up
2015-10-22 21:27:30	AJ44	yeah, i've seen that
2015-10-22 21:27:34	AJ44	that's why I asked
2015-10-22 21:27:47	AJ44	i tried to watch it once, but it seemed too dense and i couldn't get the slang
2015-10-22 21:27:50	indeedwatson	i watched it 3 or 4 times
2015-10-22 21:27:51	AJ44	really needed subs for that one
2015-10-22 21:27:57	indeedwatson	definitely
2015-10-22 21:28:08	AJ44	3 or 4 times, the whole thing?
2015-10-22 21:28:16	indeedwatson	yep
2015-10-22 21:28:26	indeedwatson	and im gonna watch it again soon
2015-10-22 21:28:35	uguuuu	i've heard of people here (britain) saying they needed subs for the wire
2015-10-22 21:28:36	tomflint	indeedwatson: Gary Busey!!!
2015-10-22 21:28:55	indeedwatson	uguuuu: im sure americans need subs for the wire
2015-10-22 21:29:10	uguuuu	i think americans can understand it mostly
2015-10-22 21:29:10	indeedwatson	tomflint: oh right. If it was nick nolte it'd probably have been even scarier
2015-10-22 21:29:13	uguuuu	i mean i could~
2015-10-22 21:29:14	AJ44	i feel we are straying away from this irc's point
2015-10-22 21:29:20	AJ44	yesterday was pizza, tonight is tv shows
2015-10-22 21:29:32	AJ44	but the wire seems interesting
2015-10-22 21:29:32	indeedwatson	you must not hang around irc channels much :p
2015-10-22 21:29:39	uguuuu	i haven't watched a film in weeks :V
2015-10-22 21:29:43	AJ44	haha i wish I did it more often to be honest
2015-10-22 21:29:52	AJ44	but I'll never settle in a nice chat
2015-10-22 21:30:03	tomflint	nothing is scarier than Gary!
2015-10-22 21:30:14	indeedwatson	ive been in a fitness channel for about a year and fitness is what we least talk about
2015-10-22 21:33:12	AJ44	haha yeah
2015-10-22 21:33:21	AJ44	i suppose you just get acquainted with the people
2015-10-22 21:36:17	indeedwatson	yea, by now i added a bunch of them on fb
2015-10-22 21:37:29	indeedwatson	Carson popped in once :p
2015-10-22 21:37:49	AJ44	i wouldnt have much to add to a fitness chanell
2015-10-22 21:37:57	AJ44	except that I do work out and like pilates
2015-10-22 21:39:42	indeedwatson	like i said we barely talk fitness :)
2015-10-22 21:41:28	uguuuu	so how about christopher nolan, great director or greatest director?
2015-10-22 21:41:58	indeedwatson	only director
2015-10-22 21:42:16	indeedwatson	does he have any movies planned?
2015-10-22 21:42:26	AJ44	i like him
2015-10-22 21:42:31	AJ44	i really liked inception
2015-10-22 21:43:00	AJ44	i didn't care so much about batman, but i've seen those a while ago
2015-10-22 21:43:35	indeedwatson	it's funny how his first film feels much more indie and "european"
2015-10-22 21:44:32	AJ44	i've seen prestige, inception, and memento
2015-10-22 21:44:39	AJ44	and the two first batmans
2015-10-22 21:44:42	AJ44	is his first any good?
2015-10-22 21:48:20	indeedwatson	i don't recall tbh
2015-10-22 21:48:25	indeedwatson	it's about a man following a woman
2015-10-22 21:48:28	indeedwatson	in b&w
2015-10-22 21:48:39	uguuuu	i believe it is called... the stalkening
2015-10-22 21:48:51	indeedwatson	i went through that phase of "i really like this director, i should watch all his work"
2015-10-22 21:48:56	indeedwatson	and i was disappointed
2015-10-22 21:48:58	indeedwatson	same with Fincher
2015-10-22 21:49:01	AJ44	with nolan?
2015-10-22 21:49:04	indeedwatson	yeah
2015-10-22 21:49:08	AJ44	i've been doing that with lumet, it's been fun
2015-10-22 21:49:13	uguuuu	maybe you should pick less plebeian directors!
2015-10-22 21:49:16	AJ44	you get a better grasp of a director's filmography
2015-10-22 21:49:21	AJ44	fincher is okay
2015-10-22 21:49:26	indeedwatson	oww sick burn
2015-10-22 21:49:30	indeedwatson	but it was years ago
2015-10-22 21:49:36	indeedwatson	so i was more pleb myself
2015-10-22 21:50:10	indeedwatson	i've been meaning to rewatch Zodiak and Social Network
2015-10-22 21:50:10	AJ44	aren't we ever
2015-10-22 21:50:30	AJ44	i've never seen zodiac
2015-10-22 21:50:38	AJ44	but I did rewatch social network a while ago
2015-10-22 21:50:41	AJ44	don't remember much
2015-10-22 21:50:45	AJ44	maybe that's not a good sign
2015-10-22 21:51:40	spooky	<indeedwatson> i've been meaning to rewatch Zodiak and Social Network
2015-10-22 21:51:42	spooky	loved zodiac
2015-10-22 21:51:55	spooky	never watched social network coz i don't even have facebook and i hate social networks
2015-10-22 21:52:05	indeedwatson	i didn't, that's why i want to rewatch it
2015-10-22 21:52:20	spooky	oh. i thought rewatch means to watch again
2015-10-22 21:52:26	indeedwatson	that's very silly reasoning
2015-10-22 21:52:33	spooky	really?
2015-10-22 21:52:35	indeedwatson	spooky: yes, i was saying i didn't love zodiak
2015-10-22 21:52:38	indeedwatson	zodiac
2015-10-22 21:52:42	spooky	so if i hate a subject i should watch the movie based on it?
2015-10-22 21:52:47	indeedwatson	I hate FB with a passion
2015-10-22 21:52:53	indeedwatson	the movie is not about social networks lol
2015-10-22 21:52:59	spooky	yeahj
2015-10-22 21:53:05	spooky	facebook is a social network
2015-10-22 21:53:15	indeedwatson	it's about how Zuckerberg made the site and his friendship and betrayals etc
2015-10-22 21:53:40	spooky	yeah. thats defiantely something am not interested in
2015-10-22 21:54:06	spooky	indeedwatson> spooky: yes, i was saying i didn't love zodiak <-- wow thats amazing
2015-10-22 21:54:11	AJ44	what
2015-10-22 21:54:16	AJ44	rewatch isn't watching again?
2015-10-22 21:54:20	uguuuu	it is that
2015-10-22 21:54:31	spooky	AJ44: what does rewatch mean to you?
2015-10-22 21:54:46	indeedwatson	you're not interested in human relations and how they're affected by power and money?
2015-10-22 21:54:53	AJ44	you watch a film for the first time -> you watched it. you watch it a second or third, rewatch
2015-10-22 21:54:59	uguuuu	i don't think simply not liking or participating on social networks is sufficient justifcation to not watch a film about one though
2015-10-22 21:55:14	indeedwatson	spooky: i watched zodiac too close to Memories of Murder, which is my favorite crime movie
2015-10-22 21:55:17	AJ44	the social network is good whether or not you like or use social networks
2015-10-22 21:55:25	indeedwatson	and i had some expectations from it, i guess
2015-10-22 21:55:29	AJ44	it isn't specifically about facebook
2015-10-22 21:55:33	uguuuu	like, they have immense cultural and social relevance these days
2015-10-22 21:55:45	uguuuu	watching a film about x isn't participating in x
2015-10-22 21:55:56	spooky	uguuu: i understand
2015-10-22 21:56:14	spooky	but i have no interest in the subjects relating to or even closely associated with facebook
2015-10-22 21:56:21	indeedwatson	yeah, it's kinda like saying i don't like slavery so I won't watch 12 Years a Slave
2015-10-22 21:56:28	spooky	i prefer to spend my time with subjects that interest me
2015-10-22 21:56:32	spooky	because i have finite time
2015-10-22 21:56:34	uguuuu	that's fine
2015-10-22 21:56:41	spooky	if i have all the time in the world, i will watch social network
2015-10-22 21:56:59	uguuuu	but i mean, personally, i think that what makes a good film and an enjoyable experience is largely unrelated to subject matter
2015-10-22 21:57:00	spooky	indeedwatson: its possible to dislike slavery but have an interest in the subject
2015-10-22 21:57:09	spooky	its also possible to dislike slavery and have no interest in the subject
2015-10-22 21:57:13	uguuuu	as long as there's sufficient human interest in the subject matter
2015-10-22 21:57:19	spooky	these sort of things shape our tastes and interest
2015-10-22 21:57:21	AJ44	i can't be sympathetic with spooky's argument
2015-10-22 21:57:21	uguuuu	and the filmmaking is solid
2015-10-22 21:58:09	spooky	uguuuu: its possible. i have been interested in films where i was never interested in the subject beforehand
2015-10-22 21:58:21	spooky	but i still first had an interest to watch the film
2015-10-22 21:58:29	spooky	i like fincher a lot as a filmmaker
2015-10-22 21:58:34	spooky	but i have no interest in watching all his films
2015-10-22 21:58:48	spooky	i never watched girl with the dragon tattoo or social network
2015-10-22 21:58:53	indeedwatson	if i could go back in time i'd unwatch The Game
2015-10-22 21:58:57	uguuuu	i haven't seen either of those either
2015-10-22 21:59:11	spooky	i thought zodiac was brilliant
2015-10-22 21:59:12	AJ44	oh boy, i would never watch the girl and the dragon tattoo either
2015-10-22 21:59:21	AJ44	unless, for strictly cinematographic purposes
2015-10-22 21:59:22	spooky	and i also loved gone girl
2015-10-22 21:59:23	indeedwatson	if nothing else, those movies are worth it based on the OST alone
2015-10-22 21:59:39	AJ44	by the way, i'm reading hulk's essay on cinematography
2015-10-22 21:59:43	AJ44	he took a jab at fincher lol
2015-10-22 21:59:50	indeedwatson	AJ44: the one about Tom Hooper?
2015-10-22 21:59:55	AJ44	yeah
2015-10-22 22:00:00	uguuuu	yeah, there's something about fincher's aesthetic and philosophy that disagrees with me
2015-10-22 22:00:01	AJ44	another jab on hooper as we speak
2015-10-22 22:00:07	indeedwatson	yeah im not sure i agree with his view on Fincher but I think he has a point
2015-10-22 22:00:42	indeedwatson	it's one of those "i disagree but i see your point and find it interesting"
2015-10-22 22:00:58	spooky	really? i think fincher is one of the most versed in film language (sorsese as well).
2015-10-22 22:01:39	AJ44	well i'm not reading the fincher article
2015-10-22 22:01:52	AJ44	he basically just says that fincher has a limited colour palette throughout his movies
2015-10-22 22:02:10	spooky	the way fincher's films are edited is a clinic in film language
2015-10-22 22:02:18	indeedwatson	spooky: the hulk says that Fincher is a perfectionist and GREAT at details and shit, but he's too cold and cynic for a particular style
2015-10-22 22:02:29	spooky	ah
2015-10-22 22:02:30	spooky	hehe
2015-10-22 22:02:31	spooky	interesting
2015-10-22 22:02:37	indeedwatson	and that shows mostly in Benjamin Button
2015-10-22 22:02:37	spooky	i don't mind cold and cynical :)
2015-10-22 22:02:41	indeedwatson	which i agree with 
2015-10-22 22:03:03	spooky	i think i'm personally cynical too so maybe thats why ii agree with fincher.
2015-10-22 22:03:03	indeedwatson	i dont either, i like it, but i gotta admit it's a mismatch when he tries to do something more suited for spielberg and the like
2015-10-22 22:03:11	indeedwatson	you know what i mean?
2015-10-22 22:03:13	spooky	maybe even sometimes i think he's not cynical enuff
2015-10-22 22:03:28	spooky	yes
2015-10-22 22:03:30	spooky	i think i do
2015-10-22 22:03:42	spooky	like seven is a good film for him
2015-10-22 22:03:45	spooky	or zodiac
2015-10-22 22:03:53	spooky	coz they're darker and play to his strength
2015-10-22 22:04:54	spooky	i just find when i watch films by fincher, i'm always being surprised and impressed by his choices
2015-10-22 22:05:04	spooky	except sometimes in casting :P
2015-10-22 22:05:30	spooky	casting tyler perry in gone girl was a weird choice
2015-10-22 22:05:34	indeedwatson	have you seen benjamin button?
2015-10-22 22:05:38	spooky	nope
2015-10-22 22:05:47	indeedwatson	well if you did, you'd know what i mean
2015-10-22 22:05:56	indeedwatson	it's a very forest gumpy movie
2015-10-22 22:06:13	spooky	oh boy. hjahaha. will definately not watch it now
2015-10-22 22:06:16	indeedwatson	but his style remains like you said, dark and clinic
2015-10-22 22:06:23	spooky	i hate that kind of hollywood film
2015-10-22 22:06:38	indeedwatson	i don't but they are a bit tiring
2015-10-22 22:07:23	spooky	yeah. 1 forrest gump type film is enough for me
2015-10-22 22:07:24	AJ44	hmm i've seen button
2015-10-22 22:07:29	spooky	i prefer to see something else
2015-10-22 22:07:30	AJ44	but it was so long ago, i can't join the conversation
2015-10-22 22:08:12	indeedwatson	AJ44: i think it's very forgettable
2015-10-22 22:08:28	AJ44	but talking about style is interesting
2015-10-22 22:08:33	indeedwatson	when i was thinking of Fincher films I didn't like, I only thought of The Game, and completely forgot about this one
2015-10-22 22:08:40	AJ44	so a forgettable film can be relevant in that context
2015-10-22 22:08:59	indeedwatson	AJ44: i really liked the part where Hulk talks about his teacher
2015-10-22 22:10:42	AJ44	yes!
2015-10-22 22:10:44	AJ44	that was impressive
2015-10-22 22:10:48	AJ44	it was in the beggining
2015-10-22 22:10:59	AJ44	makes me wonder how much I'm missing by having the wrong teachers at the wrong time
2015-10-22 22:11:07	AJ44	or maybe, the right teachers at the wrong time
2015-10-22 22:11:12	indeedwatson	heh
2015-10-22 22:11:20	AJ44	you can be so much influenced by a good lecture or a good teacher
2015-10-22 22:12:03	spooky	AJ44: are you studying film?
2015-10-22 22:12:19	AJ44	nope
2015-10-22 22:12:22	AJ44	i'm studying mathematics
2015-10-22 22:12:27	spooky	oh
2015-10-22 22:12:30	AJ44	so trust me, it can apply as well lol
2015-10-22 22:12:40	spooky	i know
2015-10-22 22:12:42	spooky	i studied film
2015-10-22 22:13:00	indeedwatson	AJ44: did you watch Les Miserables?
2015-10-22 22:13:29	AJ44	nope
2015-10-22 22:13:34	AJ44	he's ranting about it as well
2015-10-22 22:13:38	AJ44	are you reading the article too?
2015-10-22 22:14:54	indeedwatson	i read it a few months ago
2015-10-22 22:15:03	indeedwatson	im not planning on watching that movie
2015-10-22 22:15:08	indeedwatson	tho i want to read the book
2015-10-22 22:15:54	AJ44	this essay is actually very entertaining
2015-10-22 22:16:00	--	usr is now known as choomin
2015-10-22 22:16:01	AJ44	he's redeeming himself from that horrible birdman one
2015-10-22 22:16:09	--	choomin is now known as usr
2015-10-22 22:17:18	AJ44	he's talking about cassavetes now
2015-10-22 22:19:16	indeedwatson	AJ44: he did an ama in the sub a few months back, it's worth checking too
2015-10-22 22:19:28	AJ44	yeah, i gave it a light read
2015-10-22 22:19:37	AJ44	he really knows his way around stuff
2015-10-22 22:19:46	AJ44	i wonder who's the person behind the gimmick
2015-10-22 22:19:50	AJ44	i think someone asked him that
2015-10-22 22:19:54	indeedwatson	i recall reading it's actually a woman
2015-10-22 22:20:03	indeedwatson	but i didn't look into it
2015-10-22 22:20:07	AJ44	whoa

2015-10-22 22:20:16	uguuuu	what a tweest
2015-10-22 22:20:23	indeedwatson	he talks about feminism a lot
2015-10-22 22:20:24	AJ44	but anyhow, it makes us wonder, the internet is such a weird place
2015-10-22 22:20:33	indeedwatson	that reminds me, the gone girl article is also hood

2015-10-22 22:21:05	AJ44	i don't want to be harsh, but there's a lack of women in the industry
2015-10-22 22:21:07	indeedwatson	i never followed evert actually
2015-10-22 22:21:08	AJ44	i wonder why
2015-10-22 22:21:23	AJ44	i usually read his stuff on the films I watch
2015-10-22 22:21:25	AJ44	he was cute
2015-10-22 22:21:37	AJ44	they're not essays, it's just opinions
2015-10-22 22:23:47	AJ44	but I understand that, whoever hulk is, he doesn't want to come out
2015-10-22 22:24:25	indeedwatson	yeah, one theory is that s/he is someone famous
2015-10-22 22:24:29	indeedwatson	or relatively famous
2015-10-22 22:29:12	AJ44	it was a very fine article

2015-10-22 22:35:47	indeedwatson	haha
2015-10-22 22:36:22	indeedwatson	what did he say
2015-10-22 22:38:53	AJ44	they sucked each other basically
2015-10-22 22:39:34	AJ44	you could tell that if they ever met, they would talk for hours and a particular glow would come out of both of them
2015-10-22 22:39:34	AJ44	2) Do you think of yourself as espousing a primarily humanist point of view?
2015-10-22 22:39:34	AJ44	tony asked that
2015-10-22 22:39:38	AJ44	hulk replied with 8 lines of caps lock text
2015-10-22 22:40:02	AJ44	they were engaging so hard on a very philosophical level
2015-10-22 22:40:34	AJ44	hulk wrote some books, now that i didnt know

2015-10-22 22:49:59	indeedwatson	Soderbergh is one of those directors i know by name but struggle to recall what he made
2015-10-22 22:50:51	indeedwatson	Solaris remake, Ocean's 11, Magic Mike
2015-10-22 22:50:56	indeedwatson	im not impressed at all

2015-10-22 22:53:26	AJ44	you know, i bet some of those guys are really insightful
2015-10-22 22:53:48	AJ44	that reminds me, next saturday there will be a talk with a portuguese filmmaker
2015-10-22 22:53:52	AJ44	i'll be sure to attend
2015-10-22 22:54:15	AJ44	i've already met one of the most talented portuguese young directors, and it was very insightful
2015-10-22 22:54:29	AJ44	and it's a bit sad because you feel there aren't enough people appreciating their work
2015-10-22 22:55:44	AJ44	well, i really must go. have a test tomorrow, and it won't, very unfortunately, be about lumet's films lol
2015-10-22 22:56:07	Carson	good luck on the test, cya later

2015-10-23 15:25:21	Carson	no
2015-10-23 15:25:35	spooky	indeedwatson: i think that's a personal choice. some people prefer to read the books instead of watching a movie adaptation
2015-10-23 15:26:29	indeedwatson	spooky: but it's silly to generalize and say books are inherently better, without taking into account what a movie can a achieve that a book can't
2015-10-23 15:28:02	spooky	i agree. but for someone, the things that a movie achieves that a book cannot they see as unnecessary because also a film has to change A LOT of things to adapt the book
2015-10-23 15:30:19	spooky	also when you adapt a book to screen, unless you're the author of the original work, more than 20% has to be original

2015-10-23 15:43:19	Carson	lol what is wrong with me
2015-10-23 15:43:24	indeedwatson	:)
2015-10-23 15:43:40	indeedwatson	what are you hoping to put in it?
2015-10-23 15:43:54	indeedwatson	we really need a bot so we can store quotes, and quick yt and imdb searches
2015-10-23 15:44:18	Carson	well it will be a process
2015-10-23 15:44:53	indeedwatson	i will ask around cause i've got no idea how to get a bot
2015-10-23 15:44:54	Carson	well you can put youtube users
2015-10-23 15:45:00	Carson	and film critics
2015-10-23 15:45:18	Carson	yeah I need to find what happened to gitgud again
2015-10-23 15:45:26	Carson	find out
2015-10-23 16:08:41	Carson	i edited the sheet indeedwatson
2015-10-23 16:08:56	Carson	having trouble with links, i'd like to keep that box small
2015-10-23 16:09:03	Carson	but it will over lap
2015-10-23 16:10:57	indeedwatson	im sure tomflint can help you tidy it up, I know noting of spreadsheets :/
2015-10-23 16:11:41	Carson	lol
2015-10-23 16:11:58	Carson	i guess i should put everything in one main column
2015-10-23 16:12:04	Carson	and have the links at the end
2015-10-23 16:14:47	indeedwatson	nah i think it's good like that
2015-10-23 16:15:20	indeedwatson	if anything, make multiple tabs
2015-10-23 16:15:28	indeedwatson	but im sure the links can be shortened somehow
2015-10-23 16:49:59	tomflint	Carson: you want small links?
2015-10-23 16:50:18	Carson	yes
2015-10-23 16:50:22	tomflint	do this -- =IF(ISBLANK(D5),,(HYPERLINK("https://pfmonkey.com/search/"&E5&"&?t=2040", "🔗" )))
2015-10-23 16:50:22		[ http://is.gd/6Cbo0d ]
2015-10-23 16:51:00	tomflint	replace D5 with the cell with your Title (B3) and the link with whatever you want for the link...
2015-10-23 16:51:14	tomflint	oh wait, are these auto-generated links or ones you're pasting in?
2015-10-23 16:51:24	Carson	ones i'm pasting in
2015-10-23 16:51:42	tomflint	are you planning on sorting this data at any point?
2015-10-23 16:52:48	Carson	no
2015-10-23 16:52:58	tomflint	G6 --
2015-10-23 16:53:01	tomflint	that has your short link
2015-10-23 16:53:03	Carson	wanted to make a community paste board for links
2015-10-23 16:53:37	tomflint	hm. I'd almost have an input form that outputs to a data set that you can build from....
2015-10-23 16:53:59	tomflint	here's another thing you can do...
2015-10-23 16:53:59	Carson	okay, I'll probably wait
2015-10-23 16:54:17	tomflint	G doesn't overflow
2015-10-23 16:54:22	Carson	there is another service called enboard that might update soon, to do exactly what i want
2015-10-23 16:55:22	tomflint	do you see the G column though?
2015-10-23 16:56:16	Carson	yes
2015-10-23 16:56:52	tomflint	you could do something like that...
2015-10-23 16:57:02	Carson	ok
2015-10-23 16:57:11	tomflint	we could even use a VLookup from another data entry sheet to compile everything
2015-10-23 16:58:22	tomflint	if you want, I can build the sheet for you
2015-10-23 17:01:08	indeedwatson	yo tom im gonna pester you about pizza again
2015-10-23 17:01:28	indeedwatson	how do you usually cook it
2015-10-23 17:01:44	tomflint	I use a baking steel ---
2015-10-23 17:01:48	indeedwatson	directly on your baking steel?
2015-10-23 17:02:00	indeedwatson	you put it there with toppings and all and just wait?
2015-10-23 17:02:06	tomflint	I have it on the top rack, preheated at 550˚ for 30+ minutes, then broiled for 15 minutes.
2015-10-23 17:02:10	tomflint	nah
2015-10-23 17:02:28	tomflint	I make the pie on the dusted wooden pizza peel, shaking between each ingredient to ensure its not sticking
2015-10-23 17:02:39	tomflint	once the pie is ready, I launch it onto the steel ---
2015-10-23 17:02:51	indeedwatson	i usually cook the pie with sauce a bit first
2015-10-23 17:02:55	tomflint	after 3m30s I retrieve it with an aluminum peel
2015-10-23 17:03:00	indeedwatson	or the cheese gets too crispy
2015-10-23 17:03:06	tomflint	during that 3 minutes I make the second pizza
2015-10-23 17:03:19	tomflint	did you see the last pizzas I made?
2015-10-23 17:03:22	indeedwatson	yes
2015-10-23 17:03:32	indeedwatson	looked good
2015-10-23 17:03:41	indeedwatson	but im not sure i can get the dough charred like that at the top
2015-10-23 17:03:45	indeedwatson	without burning the cheese
2015-10-23 17:03:50	tomflint	yeah, if you have a peel you can
2015-10-23 17:03:56	tomflint	er... a steel
2015-10-23 17:04:12	indeedwatson	i don't :(
2015-10-23 17:04:14	indeedwatson	just a stone
2015-10-23 17:05:09	indeedwatson	i could preheat a baking sheet i guess
2015-10-23 17:07:25	tomflint	the steel is important
2015-10-23 17:07:28	tomflint	not just a sheet
2015-10-23 17:07:37	tomflint	the steel holds heat for hours
2015-10-23 17:07:51	tomflint	any sort of sheet will lose its heat within seconds of having a pizza on it

2015-10-23 17:12:51	tomflint	use the stone then
2015-10-23 17:12:53	indeedwatson	i could use the broiler and the stone i guess

2015-10-23 17:13:04	Carson	no, i just haven't organized it much yet
2015-10-23 17:13:09	tomflint	heat it for 45 minutes if you can
2015-10-23 17:13:17	indeedwatson	really? i usually had it at the bottom
2015-10-23 17:14:37	tomflint	another thing you can do is have the stone on the top rack, bake normally...
2015-10-23 17:14:50	tomflint	but before you put your pies in, preheat the broiler

2015-10-23 17:35:26	tomflint	I could do a vlookup to sort it all too
2015-10-23 17:35:36	tomflint	but you can use the filters for that

2015-10-23 18:09:47	tomflint	I mean, you could make a form to input all of the data and then make it pretty ---
2015-10-23 18:09:51	tomflint	but if it works, it's fine
2015-10-23 18:10:10	indeedwatson	if you have a guide that i can follow to do that I'd do it

2015-10-23 18:12:43	indeedwatson	when i do 3 sets of 8, for example, i write it 3*8, but sometimes i can't do all sets have the same reps
2015-10-23 18:12:49	indeedwatson	so i separate sets with a coma
2015-10-23 18:13:49	indeedwatson	how do you put the days in that one?
2015-10-23 18:14:05	indeedwatson	i use 1 column per day
2015-10-23 18:14:08	tomflint	hm. that's per week, actually --
2015-10-23 18:14:11	tomflint	not the best
2015-10-23 18:14:22	tomflint	you would change the SET to dates
2015-10-23 18:14:26	indeedwatson	ideally i guess it'd be like nested columns
2015-10-23 18:14:31	tomflint	yeah
2015-10-23 18:15:07	indeedwatson	but then there's different numbers of sets per exercise too

2015-10-23 18:20:25	Carson	but yeah I guess the form would be the best thing to do, because the spreadsheet may get messed up because it is open to all

2015-10-23 20:46:17	indeedwatson	nah
2015-10-23 20:46:30	indeedwatson	im upset cause i was hyped about it
2015-10-23 20:46:34	tomflint	so how was it ruined?
2015-10-23 20:47:03	indeedwatson	when i passed it from the bowl were it was rising to the counter i couldn't keep it the same shape
2015-10-23 20:47:20	indeedwatson	and then it got stuck on the counter and i just had to ball it and spread it again
2015-10-23 20:47:29	tomflint	ha. thats the worst
2015-10-23 20:47:46	indeedwatson	and then i tested putting the cheese at the same time as the dough in the oven, which everyone seems to do
2015-10-23 20:48:02	indeedwatson	i put it at the bottom of the oven planning to put it on the stone after a few mins
2015-10-23 20:48:20	indeedwatson	but when i was gonna do that i saw the cheese was pretty much almost liquid lol
2015-10-23 20:48:24	indeedwatson	so i just took it out
2015-10-23 20:48:33	tomflint	liquid is good though
2015-10-23 20:48:33	indeedwatson	...and it was stuck on the baking sheet
2015-10-23 20:48:36	tomflint	what kind of cheese?
2015-10-23 20:48:40	indeedwatson	mozarella
2015-10-23 20:48:49	tomflint	yeah, liquid is good for mozza
2015-10-23 20:48:56	indeedwatson	took me 10 minutes to scrape it off the sheet
2015-10-23 20:48:56	tomflint	but it was stuck to the pan?
2015-10-23 20:49:00	indeedwatson	yes
2015-10-23 20:49:16	indeedwatson	and it's underdone
2015-10-23 20:49:19	indeedwatson	the dough
2015-10-23 20:49:32	tomflint	do you still have it though?
2015-10-23 20:49:48	indeedwatson	im on the 3rd slice
2015-10-23 20:49:57	tomflint	ha. nice
2015-10-23 20:49:57	indeedwatson	a pizza has to be REALLY bad for me not to eat it :p
2015-10-23 20:50:07	tomflint	toss it onto the stone under the broiler
2015-10-23 20:50:11	indeedwatson	and the pepperoni saves it
2015-10-23 20:50:14	tomflint	well, if the stone is hot
2015-10-23 20:50:43	indeedwatson	nah there's 3 slices left
2015-10-23 20:50:50	indeedwatson	the stone was in the middle rack
2015-10-23 20:51:58	tomflint	how hot was the oven?
2015-10-23 20:52:55	indeedwatson	i have no idea
2015-10-23 20:52:59	indeedwatson	as hot as i could get it
2015-10-23 20:53:14	tomflint	ok sweet. how long did you preheat the stone?
2015-10-23 20:53:23	indeedwatson	i'll take a pic of a slice
2015-10-23 20:53:27	indeedwatson	like 40mins
2015-10-23 20:53:32	tomflint	nice
2015-10-23 20:53:33	indeedwatson	but i didn't get to use it
2015-10-23 20:53:39	tomflint	do you have a wooden cutting board?
2015-10-23 20:53:48	indeedwatson	tomorrow i hope i can do better
2015-10-23 20:54:03	indeedwatson	it's sad cause my last pizza was so much better
2015-10-23 20:54:05	indeedwatson	yes
2015-10-23 20:54:14	indeedwatson	i don't have one of those shovels for pizza tho
2015-10-23 20:54:20	tomflint	does it have any grooves or is it completely flat?
2015-10-23 20:56:14	indeedwatson	it has like the borders lifted

2015-10-23 20:59:16	indeedwatson	wait
2015-10-23 20:59:20	tomflint	what's the bottom of the cutting board like?

2015-10-23 20:59:49	indeedwatson	see that?
2015-10-23 20:59:51	tomflint	ha. that's raw dough!
2015-10-23 21:00:00	tomflint	why not give it a good broil?
2015-10-23 21:00:17	indeedwatson	because it was very stuck to the pan
2015-10-23 21:00:25	indeedwatson	and i was defeated
2015-10-23 21:00:31	indeedwatson	i just wanted to take it out
2015-10-23 21:00:45	tomflint	is the stone still hot?
2015-10-23 21:01:06	indeedwatson	a bit
2015-10-23 21:01:08	indeedwatson	but not very
2015-10-23 21:01:35	tomflint	move it to the top rack, broil for 5 minutes then slide the pizza onto the stone
2015-10-23 21:01:41	tomflint	use a lifter or something to get it in and out
2015-10-23 21:02:13	indeedwatson	the bottom is pretty charred
2015-10-23 21:02:21	indeedwatson	it'd burn i think
2015-10-23 21:02:47	indeedwatson	i just wanna figure out what i did wrong to avoid doing the same tomorrow
2015-10-23 21:02:51	tomflint	then give it a good broil --
2015-10-23 21:02:57	tomflint	it'll only cook the top
2015-10-23 21:03:05	tomflint	keep it about 6" away from the broiler
2015-10-23 21:03:35	indeedwatson	the broiler is at the bottom, im not sure how much there is between the fire and the tray
2015-10-23 21:03:59	tomflint	oh yeah, forgot about that
2015-10-23 21:04:02	tomflint	hm..
2015-10-23 21:04:22	indeedwatson	is it possible the dough was too wet?
2015-10-23 21:04:31	tomflint	next time you make pizza, it might be best to have the stone on the top top rack in order to capture the heat that bounces off the roof
2015-10-23 21:04:36	indeedwatson	should i oil the pan or put lots of flour?
2015-10-23 21:04:45	tomflint	nah, no oil --
2015-10-23 21:04:54	indeedwatson	how do i make it not stick
2015-10-23 21:04:58	tomflint	only the smallest bit of flour -- just enough so it doesn't stick
2015-10-23 21:05:06	tomflint	but don't use the pan...
2015-10-23 21:05:10	tomflint	put it directly onto the stone
2015-10-23 21:05:16	tomflint	do you have parchment paper?
2015-10-23 21:05:36	indeedwatson	no
2015-10-23 21:06:17	indeedwatson	why?
2015-10-23 21:06:35	tomflint	you can use that under the pie so it doesn't stick
2015-10-23 21:06:55	indeedwatson	i haven't had a pie stick in... idk, years
2015-10-23 21:06:59	indeedwatson	i can't even remember
2015-10-23 21:07:15	tomflint	you should be fine if you're launching it directly onto the stone
2015-10-23 21:07:31	indeedwatson	the stone, put at the top?
2015-10-23 21:07:47	indeedwatson	and then i put it on a pan, and try the broiler?
2015-10-23 21:07:55	tomflint	nah, no pans at all
2015-10-23 21:08:11	tomflint	the stone on top, preheated for a while, then you put the pie directly onto the stone
2015-10-23 21:08:30	indeedwatson	and just leave it there until it's done?
2015-10-23 21:08:36	tomflint	si
2015-10-23 21:08:55	indeedwatson	damn this bible guy and his 2 steels
2015-10-23 21:09:37	tomflint	a steel or two is the best
2015-10-23 21:09:50	indeedwatson	do you ever let it rise once it's already been stretched?
2015-10-23 21:10:33	tomflint	yeah, for about 10 minutes or so
2015-10-23 21:10:35	tomflint	not long
2015-10-23 21:11:11	indeedwatson	putting it on the stone with the toppings on top could be a disaster
2015-10-23 21:11:34	tomflint	nah, it should be perfect
2015-10-23 21:11:53	tomflint	what I would do is slide it from the dusted cutting board onto the stone...
2015-10-23 21:12:02	tomflint	pull the rack out a bit if you need to
2015-10-23 21:12:41	indeedwatson	given what happened today i think i'll make one pizza like that and another in a pan as backup :p
2015-10-23 21:12:50	tomflint	ha
2015-10-23 21:12:56	tomflint	I mean, pan pizza isn't bad
2015-10-23 21:13:02	tomflint	if you prefer it that way, go with it
2015-10-23 21:13:33	indeedwatson	i'll dust it a lot i guess
2015-10-23 21:13:45	tomflint	do you have any corn meal?
2015-10-23 21:15:40	indeedwatson	no
2015-10-23 21:15:44	indeedwatson	just corn starch
2015-10-23 21:15:52	indeedwatson	i thought i had semolina but i don't either
2015-10-23 21:16:04	tomflint	semolina or cornmeal is really nice for a pan pizza
2015-10-23 21:21:48	tomflint	Indeedwatson_: another thing you *could* do is put the stone on the second rack with the pan on the lowest rack
2015-10-23 21:22:10	tomflint	concentrate the heat as much as possible
2015-10-23 21:30:09	AJ44	no pizza again :(((
2015-10-23 21:30:13	AJ44	i'm so hungry
2015-10-23 21:32:05	tomflint	AJ44: what sort of oven do you have?
2015-10-23 21:32:11	AJ44	a normal one
2015-10-23 21:32:16	tomflint	top broiler?
2015-10-23 21:32:18	AJ44	oh! you said I should check something on it
2015-10-23 21:32:24	AJ44	what does a top broiler look like?
2015-10-23 21:32:41	tomflint	its that top element
2015-10-23 21:32:49	tomflint	its on the roof of the oven
2015-10-23 21:33:23	AJ44	likea a grid?
2015-10-23 21:33:30	tomflint	could be.
2015-10-23 21:33:52	tomflint	it might look like this http://www.eliteappliance.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/VikingOvenBroiler.jpg

2015-10-23 21:34:05	tomflint	sometimes its like two S's
2015-10-23 21:34:11	AJ44	yeah, sort of
2015-10-23 21:34:14	AJ44	it's a grid on the roof
2015-10-23 21:34:17	tomflint	perfect
2015-10-23 21:34:23	tomflint	how hot does your oven go?
2015-10-23 21:34:46	AJ44	less than what I had told you the other day
2015-10-23 21:34:52	tomflint	ha
2015-10-23 21:35:00	AJ44	410 fahrenheit :\
2015-10-23 21:35:11	AJ44	is it enough?
2015-10-23 21:35:18	tomflint	with the broiler it might be
2015-10-23 21:35:48	tomflint	a good baking steel would compensate for the lower temp
2015-10-23 21:35:59	AJ44	well if it helps, it does frozen pizza just fine
2015-10-23 21:35:59	AJ44	lol
2015-10-23 21:36:08	tomflint	sick
2015-10-23 21:36:16	tomflint	that cheese has wood on it, eh
2015-10-23 21:36:30	AJ44	haha
2015-10-23 21:36:34	tomflint	it does
2015-10-23 21:36:40	tomflint	they use cellulose
2015-10-23 21:36:48	AJ44	i haven't eat pizza in ages
2015-10-23 21:36:51	tomflint	its made of powdered wood chips
2015-10-23 21:36:54	AJ44	remember, i'm a veggie man
2015-10-23 21:37:03	AJ44	but that's disgusting nevertheless
2015-10-23 21:37:10	AJ44	so, you'd say i'm set for baking some pizzay
2015-10-23 21:37:11	AJ44	?
2015-10-23 21:37:24	tomflint	well, if you get a baking steel, yeah
2015-10-23 21:37:33	tomflint	its not hard to make great pizzas with the right tools
2015-10-23 21:37:55	AJ44	i don't think i'll get a baking steel for now
2015-10-23 21:38:06	tomflint	you can make your own for ~$50
2015-10-23 21:38:13	AJ44	i can't even figure my way with the dough, let alone get the fancy tools
2015-10-23 21:38:56	tomflint	ha. the tools make it easier
2015-10-23 21:39:04	tomflint	dough isn't hard. I have a fool-proof dough recipe
2015-10-23 21:39:11	AJ44	is it vegan though?
2015-10-23 21:39:15	tomflint	its easiest if you have a scale ---
2015-10-23 21:39:19	tomflint	yup
2015-10-23 21:39:24	tomflint	all dough should be vegan :)
2015-10-23 21:40:32	AJ44	hmm yeah, i sort of have a scale
2015-10-23 21:40:35	AJ44	it's not very fancy
2015-10-23 21:40:46	tomflint	any scale is good
2015-10-23 21:41:09	tomflint	even if its not accurate -- close enough is better than volumetric measurements
2015-10-23 21:42:31	indeedwatson	tomflint: so pan and stone?
2015-10-23 21:43:30	AJ44	have you got a tomato sauce recipe as well?
2015-10-23 21:43:33	tomflint	I'd put the stone on the second rack and the pan just below it
2015-10-23 21:43:37	AJ44	have you done pizza without sauce?
2015-10-23 21:43:38	tomflint	I do, AJ44
2015-10-23 21:43:50	tomflint	its not pizza without sauce
2015-10-23 21:43:53	indeedwatson	and then the pizza in the pan?
2015-10-23 21:43:59	tomflint	that'd be a flat bread
2015-10-23 21:44:03	tomflint	yeah, indeedwatson
2015-10-23 21:44:23	tomflint	indeedwatson: make sure the bottom is dusted and that it shakes around
2015-10-23 21:45:25	indeedwatson	yeah i usually have no problem with that
2015-10-23 21:47:23	tomflint	ultimately, for perfect pizza, you want to have the most heat hitting the top and bottom of the pie --
2015-10-23 21:47:33	tomflint	thats why that guy uses two steels
2015-10-23 21:47:45	tomflint	and really, getting your own cut isn't expensive
2015-10-23 21:48:26	indeedwatson	everything is expensive in argentina :p
2015-10-23 21:48:42	tomflint	yeah, that's understandable
2015-10-23 21:48:53	indeedwatson	but yeah the main issue would be finding someone to do it and make sure the material is appropriate for cooking

2015-10-26 15:05:41	indeedwatson	are any of those actually scary
2015-10-26 15:06:06	spooky	so far no. they're fun and interesting though
2015-10-26 15:06:17	spooky	i'm unfortunately not scared by much horror either
2015-10-26 15:06:27	spooky	i don't even know what's considered scary
2015-10-26 15:08:12	indeedwatson	rec scared me at the time, not sure now
2015-10-26 15:08:29	indeedwatson	like i was telling AJ44, i have to turn to games to get scared
2015-10-26 15:10:44	spooky	for me personally, i've always been a horror fan but it wasn't because the films scared me. i find the concept fun. the indian horror films have been very fun to watch. i really hate horror films that take themselves too seriously and fail (like paranormal activity series or the grunge)
2015-10-26 15:14:31	indeedwatson	i haven't seen the grudge
2015-10-26 15:14:36	indeedwatson	but i like horror atmosphere
2015-10-26 15:14:57	indeedwatson	there should be a separation between horror films because of content, and horror films because of atmopshere
2015-10-26 15:16:38	spooky	yes
2015-10-26 15:17:28	spooky	have you watched 'the visit'?
2015-10-26 15:18:35	spooky	imo that's the type of film that passes for horror today. it's more like a thrilling tv film with scenes that are supposed to be scary, but they rely on jump scares (moments where things get very quiet then suddenly THE VOLUME JUMPS TO 100)
2015-10-26 15:20:20	Carson	didn't like the visit, but I didn't think i would
2015-10-26 15:20:30	indeedwatson	i don't recall
2015-10-26 15:20:44	indeedwatson	oh
2015-10-26 15:20:45	indeedwatson	no
2015-10-26 15:20:46	spooky	i find foreign films have interesting ideas when it comes to horror films whereas american horror films are more manufactured
2015-10-26 15:20:51	indeedwatson	the shyamalangnag one
2015-10-26 15:21:02	spooky	yeah the grand parents film
2015-10-26 15:21:11	indeedwatson	aren't indian films like really manufactured too?
2015-10-26 15:22:31	spooky	kinda. it's a different type of manufactured. technically everything is, but the indian ones have what we'd (western audience) consider cheesy whereas in their culture it's normal for a film. it's a kind of naiive character trait for "good" characters. and of course, they have to have music
2015-10-26 15:23:26	indeedwatson	yeah i'd get tired of that, tho I'd watch like the most over the top of those movies
2015-10-26 15:24:49	spooky	yeah i don't mind them coz i also enjoy the music. but it's definately manufactured. i find it a little more honest though because it seems so junvenile.
2015-10-26 15:24:58	spooky	bollywood actually makes more films than hollywood

2015-10-27 22:32:15	tomflint	then in your file, reference everything on a second sheet and hide the form output sheet

2015-10-27 22:37:14	@Carson	how do you sort categories on output sheet?
2015-10-27 22:37:57	tomflint	there are a few ways. I used a basic filter on those columns
2015-10-27 22:38:57	AJ44	just watched another lumet
2015-10-27 22:39:04	AJ44	murder on the orient express
2015-10-27 22:39:22	@Carson	tom do you have to do something after someone inputs something and then it goes to the hidden sheet?
2015-10-27 22:39:36	@Carson	like approve the input?
2015-10-27 22:40:01	@Carson	nice AJ44
2015-10-27 22:40:05	@Carson	how was it?
2015-10-27 22:40:12	@Carson	what did you think of it?
2015-10-27 22:42:33	AJ44	it was nice, it's based on an agatha christie book
2015-10-27 22:42:43	AJ44	lumet writes a lot about it on his book, so I gave it a shot
2015-10-27 22:42:54	AJ44	again, you have the underlying moral situation
2015-10-27 22:43:04	AJ44	and a great story to tell
2015-10-27 22:44:29	tomflint	its all automated. The form input sheet is hidden
2015-10-27 22:45:43	indeedwatson	I wanna watch Collateral
2015-10-27 22:46:06	AJ44	ha! it's heavily referenced in that bordwell book, indeedwatson
2015-10-27 22:46:18	AJ44	i got curious as well

2015-10-27 22:46:32	AJ44	my parents watched it the other day, and I got to watch 2 minutes of it so I wouldn't get spoiled
2015-10-27 22:47:05	AJ44	tomflint, are we set on the dropbox?
2015-10-27 22:47:11	AJ44	too bad we can't put up descriptions on it
2015-10-27 22:47:13	indeedwatson	AJ44: that's why i wanna watch it :p
2015-10-27 22:47:14	tomflint	nah, not at all --
2015-10-27 22:47:19	tomflint	I'll find a better system for it
2015-10-27 22:47:23	AJ44	have you been reading it, indeedwatson ?
2015-10-27 22:47:37	AJ44	we ought to
2015-10-27 22:47:44	AJ44	it's really nice what we are setting up here
2015-10-27 22:49:08	indeedwatson	yes
2015-10-27 22:49:11	indeedwatson	started it today
2015-10-27 22:49:16	AJ44	well
2015-10-27 22:49:28	AJ44	i have it on a physical edition, and I think it reads very well
2015-10-27 22:49:49	AJ44	but i want to hear your opinion on reading it back to back instead of consulting certain chapters
2015-10-27 22:52:35	AJ44	but you should watch it before reading on, so you know what he'll be referencing in the next couple chapters
2015-10-27 22:54:17	tomflint	we might just end up with a spreadsheet with links and short descriptions
2015-10-27 22:55:09	AJ44	yeah, we really need the descriptions
2015-10-27 22:55:28	AJ44	but maybe on a doc, instead of spreadsheet
2015-10-27 22:57:02	@Carson	are we talking about the book database?
2015-10-27 22:57:08	AJ44	yep
2015-10-27 22:59:19	indeedwatson	we should add sculpting in time
2015-10-27 22:59:34	indeedwatson	all the epubs i found are set up poorly tho
2015-10-27 23:03:22	AJ44	what do you mean? badly formatted?
2015-10-27 23:03:46	AJ44	I think epubs are one of the best format for ebooks because they can be easily adapted by each device
2015-10-27 23:03:51	AJ44	i might be wrong though
2015-10-27 23:28:40	indeedwatson	yes it has page numbers in between the text
2015-10-27 23:29:21	indeedwatson	and there's parts where it has an image and a description, or a poem by arseny with no format distinction
2015-10-27 23:34:11	AJ44	i have never had any trouble with that though
2015-10-27 23:34:20	AJ44	maybe you should mess with the settings of your reader?

2015-10-28 10:55:46	indeedwatson	I'm watching Sicario tonight
2015-10-28 10:55:52	@Carson	nice
2015-10-28 10:56:06	indeedwatson	where do you usually sit in theaters?
2015-10-28 10:56:33	@Carson	around the middle row, middle seat
2015-10-28 10:57:03	@Carson	if it's a movie I don't care that much about, I will sit in on back row - middle
2015-10-28 10:57:33	@Carson	what about you?
2015-10-28 10:59:29	indeedwatson	i used to sit at the back but we chose closer seats now
2015-10-28 10:59:38	indeedwatson	i haven't been to the movies in a while tho
2015-10-28 11:00:22	@Carson	yeah I don't like the back row because sometimes you get distracted by people in front of you
2015-10-28 11:00:35	@Carson	sometimes because
2015-10-28 11:01:28	indeedwatson	i like going when there's barely any people
2015-10-28 11:01:35	indeedwatson	and based on the movies i like, that's often
2015-10-28 11:01:51	indeedwatson	when i saw Let the Right One in I think there were 3 people
2015-10-28 11:02:17	@Carson	plus the screen in larger in middle row :P

2015-10-28 11:03:07	@Carson	at like 12, and there were 2 other peopel
2015-10-28 11:03:08	indeedwatson	i regret not seeing that in theater
2015-10-28 11:03:12	@Carson	really like it though
2015-10-28 11:03:19	@Carson	hate filled theaters most of the time
2015-10-28 11:03:20	indeedwatson	yea
2015-10-28 11:03:30	@Carson	it was surreal

2015-10-28 11:56:48	indeedwatson	heh
2015-10-28 11:57:19	@Carson	not sure if I would be able to get into Adventure Time
2015-10-28 11:58:18	indeedwatson	AT is less focused
2015-10-28 11:58:22	indeedwatson	and less adult
2015-10-28 11:59:05	indeedwatson	most episodes are upbeat adventures with funny/creative stuff, and then out of nowhere you get an episode with background lore that makes the world and the character's bachkstory pretty rich
2015-10-28 11:59:21	indeedwatson	and like R&M it also deals with alternate dimensions and time travel
2015-10-28 12:03:10	@Carson	yeah i'm starting to get into it
2015-10-28 12:03:22	@Carson	I think it being more adult helps
2015-10-28 12:04:58	indeedwatson	AT is a show kids can watch and enjoy, and so can adults but adults will understand underlying themes
2015-10-28 12:05:05	indeedwatson	R&M is straight out adult
2015-10-28 13:27:30	@Carson	indeedwatson are you interested in No Man's Sky?
2015-10-28 13:29:42	indeedwatson	yes
2015-10-28 13:32:18	@Carson	just saw a new video from it
2015-10-28 13:32:36	@Carson	it looks nice, but I'm skeptical
2015-10-28 13:32:42	@Carson	why would I want to play this?
2015-10-28 13:33:15	@Carson	besides the x-wing
2015-10-28 13:33:29	@Carson	maybe exploring the world building will be fun?

2015-10-29 21:39:03	indeedwatson	Carson: have you seen Naked?
2015-10-29 21:39:09	@Carson	yes
2015-10-29 21:39:22	indeedwatson	did you like it?
2015-10-29 21:39:29	@Carson	I don't really remember what happened, but I enjoyed it a lot
2015-10-29 21:39:33	indeedwatson	i can't stand the mc for now
2015-10-29 21:39:43	@Carson	kind of like watching a roller coaster, not sure what it all meant
2015-10-29 22:47:34	@Carson	someone saw I had that film downloaded
2015-10-29 22:47:47	@Carson	they thought it was about porno
2015-10-29 22:48:24	indeedwatson	heh, sounds very generic and tame for a porno
2015-10-29 22:48:29	indeedwatson	it's getting more interesting
2015-10-29 22:48:41	@Carson	yeah I'm starting to remember the drug use in it
2015-10-29 22:48:55	@Carson	very philosophical
2015-10-29 22:49:42	indeedwatson	i've got to say i couldn't stand the first few scenes, until he goes out in the street
2015-10-29 22:52:11	indeedwatson	Carson: did i ask you if you planned any horror movies for halloween?
2015-10-29 22:52:27	@Carson	no nothing planned
2015-10-29 22:52:51	@Carson	I normally don't watch horror in October or anything either
2015-10-29 22:53:16	@Carson	my film watching is very spontaneous I suppose
2015-10-29 22:53:31	@Carson	I have been watching more Rick and Morty
2015-10-29 22:53:46	@Carson	and patiently enjoying it
2015-10-29 22:53:54	@Carson	you have anything planned indeedwatson?
2015-10-29 22:54:08	indeedwatson	nice! you watching the episodes in order now?
2015-10-29 22:54:18	@Carson	almost
2015-10-29 22:54:24	@Carson	I skipped the first two
2015-10-29 22:54:32	@Carson	and only watched 3-5
2015-10-29 22:54:45	@Carson	but next i will go to ep 1-2
2015-10-29 22:54:49	indeedwatson	im gonna have bbq with 2 friends and show them It Follows and maybe something fun like Evil Dead
2015-10-29 22:54:56	indeedwatson	nice nice
2015-10-29 22:54:57	@Carson	nice
2015-10-29 22:55:18	indeedwatson	some of the episodes get quite dark and emotional at times
2015-10-29 22:55:19	@Carson	It Follows can be hit or miss with non-film people
2015-10-29 22:55:38	@Carson	yeah the episode with the love potion ended very dark
2015-10-29 22:55:46	@Carson	but i'm sure it gets worse
2015-10-29 22:56:10	indeedwatson	i'm pretty sure they'll like it
2015-10-29 22:56:52	@Carson	no one really discusses this as much as I thought
2015-10-29 22:57:09	indeedwatson	film?
2015-10-29 22:57:19	@Carson	but what are your thoughts on the clam shell device in It Follows?
2015-10-29 22:58:03	indeedwatson	ohh
2015-10-29 22:58:07	@Carson	?
2015-10-29 22:58:10	indeedwatson	i didn't recall what you're talking about lol
2015-10-29 22:58:17	indeedwatson	hmm i didnt think much of it
2015-10-29 22:58:17	@Carson	really
2015-10-29 22:58:21	@Carson	it threw me off a bit
2015-10-29 22:58:44	@Carson	towards the beginning the main characters friends are sitting in a dark living room
2015-10-29 22:58:50	indeedwatson	the characters and setting were peppered with a few quirks so i didn't read into it (no pun intended)
2015-10-29 22:59:18	indeedwatson	yeah i recall cause i watched that scene yesterday to check the video quality of the file
2015-10-29 22:59:19	@Carson	and the other girl had a clam shell looking reading device
2015-10-29 22:59:53	@Carson	like what other examples?
2015-10-29 23:00:20	@Carson	I read a theory saying that it's set in a post-technology future
2015-10-29 23:00:31	indeedwatson	the fact that they sit outside playing gameboards or cards i guess, that is odd for teenagers to do
2015-10-29 23:00:35	@Carson	where it isn't popular to use technology anymore
2015-10-29 23:00:52	indeedwatson	based on that alone?
2015-10-29 23:01:11	indeedwatson	they also have like old crt tvs right?
2015-10-29 23:01:12	@Carson	well also the 80s style to the environments
2015-10-29 23:02:53	@Carson	I might rewatch Under the Skin
2015-10-29 23:03:18	indeedwatson	i'll pay attention when i watch it on the weekend
2015-10-29 23:03:25	indeedwatson	that's always a good idea
2015-10-29 23:03:48	indeedwatson	I wonder how good is the book
2015-10-29 23:06:48	indeedwatson	this kind of movie makes me wonder if people like this exist or if it's just characters behaving weirdly
2015-10-29 23:07:54	@Carson	in Naked?
2015-10-29 23:08:37	indeedwatson	yeah
2015-10-29 23:08:45	@Carson	they do
2015-10-29 23:09:25	indeedwatson	yeah i guess i don't go out enough
2015-10-29 23:09:36	@Carson	it's probably a good thing
2015-10-29 23:10:23	@Carson	a few years ago I spend some time with a camp of homeless people
2015-10-29 23:11:03	@Carson	although I've met a few homed people who are the same way

2015-10-29 23:11:45	indeedwatson	i'm mostly surprised at the waitress who just lets a guy follow her home and invites him in
2015-10-29 23:11:51	@Carson	director David Robert Mitchell specifically created it so that a real smartphone didn’t immediately date the film.
2015-10-29 23:12:09	@Carson	 It’s a ’60s shell compact that we turned into a cell phone e-reader.
2015-10-29 23:13:08	indeedwatson	haha
2015-10-29 23:13:21	indeedwatson	reading it like that, I think it's a smart move
2015-10-29 23:13:40	@Carson	also look out for red
2015-10-29 23:14:16	@Carson	I just read they use it a lot throughout when there is danger
2015-10-29 23:14:46	indeedwatson	i think i'd enjoy that movie high, specially the music
2015-10-29 23:15:36	@Carson	it follows?

2015-10-31 14:08:40	Carson_	that means I'll crash early tonight, which is for the best
2015-10-31 14:08:53	Carson_	a talk show?

2015-10-31 14:25:16	Carson_	you don't have to type it all out
2015-10-31 14:25:37	indeedwatson	i don't plan much cause i don't live alone
2015-10-31 14:25:42	indeedwatson	i try to eat meat every day
2015-10-31 14:25:57	indeedwatson	usually don't eat bread or drink sodas
2015-10-31 14:26:42	Carson_	how do you eat veggies and getting vitamins?
2015-10-31 14:26:51	indeedwatson	and of course everything goes out the window when i make pizza heh
2015-10-31 14:27:06	indeedwatson	i eat salads, usually lettuce, carrots
2015-10-31 14:27:10	indeedwatson	today i had broccoli
2015-10-31 14:27:44	indeedwatson	are you looking to lose weight?
2015-10-31 14:29:42	Carson_	no, just gain muscle and strength
2015-10-31 14:30:37	indeedwatson	do you know your TDEE?
2015-10-31 14:30:58	AJ44	indeedwatson , you should eat more veggies and less meat
2015-10-31 14:31:13	AJ44	that's not very healthy in the long run
2015-10-31 14:31:30	Carson_	well it depends what meats really
2015-10-31 14:31:39	indeedwatson	can't build muscle without protein
2015-10-31 14:31:46	Carson_	but yeah general less meat can be good
2015-10-31 14:31:49	indeedwatson	veggie diet with high protein is super expensive
2015-10-31 14:31:52	indeedwatson	at least here
2015-10-31 14:31:57	Carson_	it is
2015-10-31 14:32:22	Carson_	quality meats can be just as expensive
2015-10-31 14:33:14	indeedwatson	yeah, but they are also tastier to me
2015-10-31 14:33:31	Carson_	I've been trying to eat 2 eggs for breakfast, along with other stuff
2015-10-31 14:33:54	indeedwatson	i usually have 3 or 4, scrambled like alton brown does them
2015-10-31 14:34:27	Carson_	i make a batch of boiled
2015-10-31 14:34:40	indeedwatson	you could make them pickled
2015-10-31 14:34:54	Carson_	which makes cooking each morning easier
2015-10-31 14:35:33	indeedwatson	yeah, i get lazy often
2015-10-31 14:36:14	indeedwatson	whey powder is an alternative to meat
2015-10-31 14:37:02	Carson_	yeah i used to eat that
2015-10-31 14:38:21	Carson_	ran out of it, and only ate it when I worked out
2015-10-31 14:38:26	Carson_	and I haven't worked out in a while
2015-10-31 14:38:48	indeedwatson	yeah i haven't bought in a while, even tho i made some great shakes with it
2015-10-31 14:39:00	Carson_	indeedwatson what bodyweightfitness routine do you use?
2015-10-31 14:39:11	Carson_	TDEE?

2015-10-31 14:42:16	indeedwatson	np
2015-10-31 14:42:47	indeedwatson	the idea is to calculate it and then eat 300-500kcal extra, weigh yourself across weeks and adjust calories

2015-11-01 23:22:02	@Carson	yeah I have been thinking more about my sodium intake
2015-11-01 23:31:42	indeedwatson	that can be rough with certain foods
2015-11-01 23:45:09	@Carson	also I tend to get really hungry
2015-11-01 23:46:01	@Carson	and I feel like most of the healthy food I have isn't that filling

2015-11-01 23:50:03	indeedwatson	that's the good thing about meat, it's pretty filling

2015-11-02 21:16:01	@Carson	yeah a lot of people don't like it that much
2015-11-02 21:16:07	AJ44	i think its too overdone, but it didn't bother me that much
2015-11-02 21:16:20	AJ44	it's just that i've seen it with another film, one that had philip seymour hoffman
2015-11-02 21:16:26	@Carson	I was surprised that I enjoyed Prisoners so much
2015-11-02 21:16:28	AJ44	it's pretty and all but distracting
2015-11-02 21:16:38	AJ44	and there's the whole spider metaphor which i didn't get

2015-11-02 22:59:02	indeedwatson	i watched Persona and Wild Strawberries 
2015-11-02 22:59:02	dj	How its going everybody
2015-11-02 22:59:08	@Carson	nice
2015-11-02 22:59:11	@Carson	in theaters?
2015-11-02 22:59:37	indeedwatson	yes
2015-11-02 22:59:41	@Carson	good, just getting some work not done :)
2015-11-02 22:59:45	indeedwatson	was pretty cheap
2015-11-02 22:59:49	@Carson	nice
2015-11-02 22:59:54	@Carson	what did you think of his films?
2015-11-02 22:59:59	indeedwatson	it was the digital remaster or something
2015-11-02 23:00:23	indeedwatson	Persona had some artifacts which was annoying
2015-11-02 23:00:27	indeedwatson	I liked them both
2015-11-02 23:00:35	indeedwatson	tho obviously Persona was a bit confusing
2015-11-02 23:00:57	spooky	indeedwatson: the films you picked earlier for your cyberpunk film spree, you haven't seen them yet?
2015-11-02 23:01:04	spooky	or are you just watching them again
2015-11-02 23:01:07	indeedwatson	spooky: i have
2015-11-02 23:01:19	indeedwatson	akira i've seen like 10 times
2015-11-02 23:01:29	indeedwatson	BR and GitS just twice
2015-11-02 23:01:31	spooky	yeah me too
2015-11-02 23:01:45	spooky	tbh: i can't watch matrix anymore. i think twice was enuff
2015-11-02 23:02:35	spooky	br i've seen a few times. gits i think twice or once. didn't like it so much. i thought it was too short
2015-11-02 23:03:05	dj	What did you guys think of inside out if you've seen it. I've been on a bit of an animation binge for a while. I really wasn't a fan of the film
2015-11-02 23:03:28	indeedwatson	it took me a while to appreciate the themes in gits, and I keep thinking of it now that I'm reading Neuromancer
2015-11-02 23:03:41	indeedwatson	dj: i haven't seen it and I'm in no hurry to do so
2015-11-02 23:03:53	@Carson	it was okay, didn't really like the whole islands of memory story
2015-11-02 23:04:10	spooky	dj i haven't seen inside out yet :P
2015-11-02 23:04:32	dj	Yea, and the story felt a bit rushed imo. I watched big hero 6 recently and that really surprised me in a pleasant way
2015-11-02 23:04:52	indeedwatson	dj: animation in general or just modern 3D american movies?
2015-11-02 23:05:53	dj	trying to make my way through miyazaki's filmography
2015-11-02 23:06:04	indeedwatson	nice
2015-11-02 23:06:27	spooky	dj> trying to make my way through miyazaki's filmography
2015-11-02 23:06:31	spooky	that's a great filmography
2015-11-02 23:06:33	indeedwatson	in chronological order?
2015-11-02 23:07:50	dj	That's the plan. I saw princess mononoke a few years back but that's all i've seen from him, and I don't remember too much
2015-11-02 23:09:02	dj	Ooo and I just watched Seven Samurai recently. Gotta love Kurosawa
2015-11-02 23:09:07	indeedwatson	i still haven't seen Totoro :(
2015-11-02 23:09:50	spooky	dj: a few weeks ago, i showed my gf all of miyazaki's films in choronological order (she'd never seen them) and now they're some of her favorite animation movies
2015-11-02 23:10:44	indeedwatson	spooky: did you show her The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness?
2015-11-02 23:11:18	spooky	no. that's not by miyazaki it's a documentary about him
2015-11-02 23:11:25	spooky	i was showing her miyazaki's films
2015-11-02 23:11:59	indeedwatson	i know what it is
2015-11-02 23:12:07	indeedwatson	no reason why you couldn't show it anyway
2015-11-02 23:12:22	dj	:)
2015-11-02 23:13:37	spooky	the documentary and imo it's more about the technical approach of miyazaki's art and craft.
2015-11-02 23:14:18	indeedwatson	it was pretty emotional imo
2015-11-02 23:16:22	dj	I want to go through a bunch of these lists too. Feel like I haven't seen so many!  http://letterboxd.com/truefilmreddit/list/watch-this-not-that-afi-top-100-edition/detail/           http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/directors/

2015-11-03 22:25:14	@Carson	yeah same
2015-11-03 22:25:21	indeedwatson	Carson: i used to make an oatmeal that was almost a 1000 calories cup
2015-11-03 22:25:49	@Carson	nice
2015-11-03 22:26:01	@Carson	I've been back in the mood for oatmeal again
2015-11-03 22:26:09	indeedwatson	have you seen this
2015-11-03 22:26:11	indeedwatson	hang on
2015-11-03 22:26:11	@Carson	really good for my digestion as well so it's a win win right now

2015-11-03 22:26:41	@Carson	I put butter or vegan butter in my oatmeal, do you do that?
2015-11-03 22:27:24	indeedwatson	nope, never
2015-11-03 22:27:28	@Carson	it makes it 10x more enjoyable
2015-11-03 22:27:30	indeedwatson	and i don't know vegan butter
2015-11-03 22:27:55	indeedwatson	if i did that, that cup would be like 1500kcal haha
2015-11-03 22:28:02	@Carson	a company called Earth Balance makes it in the US, it's pretty common now
2015-11-03 22:28:20	@Carson	it's just a lot of oils instead, sometimes olive oil
2015-11-03 22:29:23	@Carson	i have a bag of flax chia mix that I keep forgetting to mix in
2015-11-03 22:29:47	@Carson	I'm surprised butter isn't more common w/ oatmeal
2015-11-03 22:30:13	@Carson	I mean every other breakfast carb and grain we eat has butter
2015-11-03 22:30:52	indeedwatson	i find the idea weird tbh, tho butter makes everything better

2015-11-04 21:05:36	tomflint	si
2015-11-04 21:06:01	indeedwatson	you should watch this video
2015-11-04 21:08:39	tomflint	ha. do you appreciate the film more now?
2015-11-04 21:08:52	indeedwatson	yes
2015-11-04 21:09:30	tomflint	gooood. It's such a fantastic film
2015-11-04 21:10:00	indeedwatson	none of the articles i had found explained why this well tho
2015-11-04 21:11:01	tomflint	yeah, its succinct
2015-11-04 21:11:17	tomflint	its always best to examine film with film

2015-11-04 21:13:51	tomflint	especially with films like Breathless, it's amazing to witness something that was new at a time
2015-11-04 21:14:05	tomflint	most of the films we have now are copies of these films

2015-11-04 21:29:45	indeedwatson	they should move into reddit so I can check them all from one place with one single account :)

2015-11-05 21:13:56	spooky	hai AJ44. i didn't think i was gone for long. just a day or two no?
2015-11-05 21:14:02	spooky	AJ44: not sure. might be around
2015-11-05 21:14:16	AJ44	yeah. the irc has been quiet though, with only carson indeedwatson and I
2015-11-05 21:14:27	AJ44	tom shows up every once in a while
2015-11-05 21:14:28	AJ44	haven't seen django as well
2015-11-05 21:14:39	AJ44	anyhow, what's so funny about what I said? it makes sense for me :P
2015-11-05 21:14:47	@Carson	spooky has been around some lol
2015-11-05 21:14:53	@Carson	maybe you just missed him
2015-11-05 21:15:16	spooky	AJ44: i'm the same way. i didn't think a lot of people share that mindset
2015-11-05 21:15:24	spooky	i like some b-movies more than hollywood stuff
2015-11-05 21:15:30	indeedwatson	i want to rewatch Ghostbusters
2015-11-05 21:15:32	AJ44	sidney opened my mind to that
2015-11-05 21:15:38	spooky	i even enjoyed the bollywood horror films  A LOT
2015-11-05 21:15:46	AJ44	guys, i'd love to join you know, but i'm still halfway of being there
2015-11-05 21:15:51	AJ44	will see you in a while! okay?
2015-11-05 21:16:00	indeedwatson	alright
2015-11-05 21:16:15	spooky	sometimes i like films that have fun (but not like american comedies which i think are manufactured fun) but real- sometimes unintentional fun
2015-11-05 21:16:39	indeedwatson	like Troll 2?
2015-11-05 21:16:47	spooky	isn't that american?
2015-11-05 21:17:07	spooky	well, i've never seen it
2015-11-05 21:17:07	spooky	but i think like that
2015-11-05 21:17:07	spooky	i really like bikini carwash company
2015-11-05 21:17:12	spooky	i don't like the second one though
2015-11-05 21:17:13	indeedwatson	a movie can't have unintentional fun based on nationality? lol
2015-11-05 21:17:34	spooky	<spooky> sometimes i like films that have fun (but not like american comedies <---check this part
2015-11-05 21:17:44	indeedwatson	it's not really a comedy
2015-11-05 21:18:30	indeedwatson	and the director was italian
2015-11-05 21:18:37	spooky	okay
2015-11-05 21:18:37	spooky	i've never seen it
2015-11-05 21:18:39	indeedwatson	and barely knew english, iirc from the documentary about it
2015-11-05 21:18:53	spooky	lol
2015-11-05 21:19:02	spooky	i doubt the film is considered italian just because of that
2015-11-05 21:19:05	indeedwatson	it's like The Room where the director thought he was making an actually good film
2015-11-05 21:19:34	indeedwatson	well the country label doesn't really matter to me
2015-11-05 21:19:38	indeedwatson	except with my own 
2015-11-05 21:19:45	indeedwatson	which is something i gotta overcome
2015-11-05 21:20:22	spooky	for me it matters only because i try not to only watch from one country (united states)
2015-11-05 21:20:29	spooky	i like to consider different countries/markets
2015-11-05 21:20:52	indeedwatson	yeah for sure
2015-11-05 21:20:56	spooky	in america, foreign films (not from here) are not given so much consideration
2015-11-05 21:21:23	spooky	thats why i like to consider the country. i like to explore different cultures and their approach to film/storytelling/art etc.
2015-11-05 21:22:00	indeedwatson	i like to pretend there are no countries heh
2015-11-05 21:22:25	indeedwatson	tho for now i'm trying to fill in lots of big gaps
2015-11-05 21:22:31	indeedwatson	actually i wanted to make a thread about that
2015-11-05 21:22:45	indeedwatson	what you consider are your biggest gaps in your film watching history
2015-11-05 21:23:41	spooky	i would love to pretend countries don't exist, but how do you overcome things like subtitles- or different structure in film? comedies are affected by culture a lot of time, so chinese comedy is very different from russian comedy
2015-11-05 21:23:51	spooky	i like the idea of different cultures
2015-11-05 21:23:54	spooky	but not borders
2015-11-05 21:24:24	indeedwatson	what do you mean? i've no problem with subtitles
2015-11-05 21:24:43	spooky	you said you like to think there are no countries. but diff. countries, speak diff. languages
2015-11-05 21:24:54	indeedwatson	yeah, i just download subs
2015-11-05 21:25:10	spooky	if you pretend there are no countries, thats a very american mindset. they just assume the whole world makes american film
2015-11-05 21:25:14	indeedwatson	what i mean is i try not to let the country of origin dictate whether i'll watch or avoid a film
2015-11-05 21:25:25	spooky	oh
2015-11-05 21:25:26	spooky	me too
2015-11-05 21:25:42	spooky	am actually more inclined to watch a foregin film than an american one
2015-11-05 21:25:45	spooky	haha
2015-11-05 21:25:59	indeedwatson	like i said for now i'm basig what i watch mostly on important directors
2015-11-05 21:26:05	indeedwatson	sometimes I don't even know where they're from
2015-11-05 21:28:02	indeedwatson	 spooky based on that, are you gonna watch SW?
2015-11-05 21:28:36	spooky	SW?
2015-11-05 21:28:43	spooky	star wars?
2015-11-05 21:28:49	indeedwatson	yea
2015-11-05 21:29:20	spooky	if i can get prescreening tickets i will. if i cannot i will wait until it's on dvd or something
2015-11-05 21:30:50	spooky	i  haven't paid for a movie ticket since maybe 2009 or 2008
2015-11-05 21:31:12	indeedwatson	lol
2015-11-05 21:31:48	spooky	if i can't watch a film early i wait until its on hbo or dvd
2015-11-05 21:32:32	indeedwatson	i don't have that chance
2015-11-05 21:33:47	indeedwatson	that lightsaber with the side lasers looks so silly
2015-11-05 21:34:18	spooky	i'm not a big fan of star wars. i didn't even watch the new ones hahaha
2015-11-05 21:34:22	spooky	the episode 1-3
2015-11-05 21:34:28	spooky	only 4-6
2015-11-05 21:34:34	spooky	so i don't really care much
2015-11-05 21:36:36	@Carson	I don't care about star wars
2015-11-05 21:36:52	@Carson	but the child inside of me is
2015-11-05 21:37:00	spooky	hehe
2015-11-05 21:37:06	@Carson	kind of excited about the new one
2015-11-05 21:37:17	spooky	understandable
2015-11-05 21:37:21	@Carson	I hate the prequels though
2015-11-05 21:37:21	indeedwatson	i hated SW until i was about 17 and my friend forced me to watch them
2015-11-05 21:37:30	@Carson	I find the management of the franchise interesting
2015-11-05 21:37:56	@Carson	I do enjoy the original films though, they are a little interesting
2015-11-05 21:38:26	spooky	i loved empire strikes back
2015-11-05 21:38:30	indeedwatson	i find Lucas intriguing
2015-11-05 21:38:32	indeedwatson	and a bit sad
2015-11-05 21:38:33	spooky	didn't think much about a new hope
2015-11-05 21:38:39	spooky	didn't enjoy return of the jedi
2015-11-05 21:38:39	@Carson	I kind of hope the completely wash away the Episode titles
2015-11-05 21:38:58	spooky	i like lucas
2015-11-05 21:38:58	spooky	i think he went thru hell to make his films
2015-11-05 21:38:58	spooky	and he won
2015-11-05 21:39:04	spooky	his first film (the sci-fi one) is amazing
2015-11-05 21:39:08	@Carson	I don't think the Episode title numbers make sense anymore, especially if they are building further
2015-11-05 21:39:24	indeedwatson	i kinda hate him i guess, his attitude in general
2015-11-05 21:39:34	spooky	Carson: they don't make sense because they're going to make them until FOREVER
2015-11-05 21:39:37	@Carson	yeah Empire and the original Star Wars are fun
2015-11-05 21:39:40	spooky	but they did in his original concept
2015-11-05 21:39:42	@Carson	"fun"
2015-11-05 21:39:49	spooky	btw: i loved THX-1138
2015-11-05 21:39:52	spooky	great film
2015-11-05 21:39:57	spooky	and american graffiti is good too
2015-11-05 21:39:58	@Carson	yes and they are making prequels sort of again
2015-11-05 21:40:02	indeedwatson	yeah i wanna watch that
2015-11-05 21:40:12	spooky	they bought star wars for about 4billion
2015-11-05 21:40:25	spooky	so they're going to make them until disney collapses
2015-11-05 21:40:28	spooky	so they don't care about episode titles
2015-11-05 21:40:32	indeedwatson	they should've made KotOR into a movie
2015-11-05 21:40:34	spooky	because also the original actors are old
2015-11-05 21:40:39	spooky	they need to make the whole thing new again
2015-11-05 21:40:46	spooky	so they can do it again for 20 years
2015-11-05 21:41:18	@Carson	yeah i'm kind of interested how interesting disney can make star wars
2015-11-05 21:41:37	@Carson	hopefully it will have some longevity
2015-11-05 21:41:48	indeedwatson	cue huge piles of cash montage
2015-11-05 21:42:08	spooky	i hope it has zero longevity
2015-11-05 21:42:11	spooky	i hate disney
2015-11-05 21:42:23	@Carson	a new star wars every year will be okay
2015-11-05 21:42:28	spooky	why would you want it to have longevity?
2015-11-05 21:42:33	@Carson	at least it's not more Marvel superheroes
2015-11-05 21:42:45	indeedwatson	they're gonna be like the CoD or Fifa of movies
2015-11-05 21:42:57	spooky	meh- i prefer new films not the same ones for every year
2015-11-05 21:43:07	@Carson	longevity, because it's fun to see how long a fire can burn
2015-11-05 21:43:19	@Carson	and how much money can they rake in out of this
2015-11-05 21:43:50	spooky	but it only does good for them. what good does it do for you?
2015-11-05 21:43:50	spooky	if i was making money from star wars, i would share your attitude
2015-11-05 21:43:52	indeedwatson	enough to cure world hunger probably
2015-11-05 21:43:57	spooky	bwahahha
2015-11-05 21:44:03	spooky	disney will never cure anything
2015-11-05 21:44:18	spooky	except blindness so ppl can watch their movies
2015-11-05 21:44:31	@Carson	lol
2015-11-05 21:44:32	@Carson	true
2015-11-05 21:44:39	indeedwatson	they will cure Walt of death if the technology to defreeze him comes around :]
2015-11-05 21:45:22	spooky	https://youtu.be/6_UI1GzaWv0
2015-11-05 21:45:23	HAL-9000	spooky: Title: THE HATEFUL EIGHT - Official Trailer - The Weinstein Company - YouTube
2015-11-05 21:45:27	indeedwatson	what i like about this is that I have no emotional involvement in it but some mild interest, so I don't care about potential spoilers etc
2015-11-05 21:45:30	spooky	there is a free screening for this on sunday
2015-11-05 21:45:38	spooky	brb
2015-11-05 21:45:46	indeedwatson	i haven't seen trailer for that
2015-11-05 21:45:49	indeedwatson	not even a poster
2015-11-05 21:45:51	indeedwatson	should I?
2015-11-05 21:45:55	@Carson	eh no
2015-11-05 21:45:59	@Carson	just go see it when it comes out
2015-11-05 21:46:16	indeedwatson	that's my usual M.O.
2015-11-05 21:46:29	@Carson	maybe I'm more optimistic about the new star wars franchise
2015-11-05 21:46:33	@Carson	not entirely sure why
2015-11-05 21:46:45	indeedwatson	except what I just said about SW, I'm watching a video about predictions 
2015-11-05 21:46:50	indeedwatson	maybe the trailers did it for you
2015-11-05 21:46:57	@Carson	maybe I'm just hoping that the quality of franchises in general will improve because of this
2015-11-05 21:47:25	@Carson	I think it's more of the behind the scenes stuff
2015-11-05 21:47:37	@Carson	I see all the love and care they are putting into it
2015-11-05 21:47:41	indeedwatson	i think they'll be alright but obviously way overrated
2015-11-05 21:48:10	@Carson	like not using full CGI people / characters
2015-11-05 21:48:15	@Carson	and actually building sets phyiscally
2015-11-05 21:48:29	@Carson	instead of huge greenscreens
2015-11-05 21:48:35	indeedwatson	maybe we can thank nolan for that :^)
2015-11-05 21:48:43	@Carson	yeah true heh
2015-11-05 21:48:52	indeedwatson	JJ didn't do that for star trek, did he?
2015-11-05 21:48:59	indeedwatson	greenscreen and lens flare everywhere
2015-11-05 21:49:03	@Carson	and maybe watching the awful prequel starwars
2015-11-05 21:49:21	@Carson	and seeing that they are actually making the right choices with production
2015-11-05 21:49:24	@Carson	with the new ones
2015-11-05 21:49:34	@Carson	yes he did
2015-11-05 21:49:46	@Carson	and I didn't like the new Treks that much
2015-11-05 21:50:11	indeedwatson	i'm not a trek fan but i sort of enjoyed the 1st, didn't watch 2nd
2015-11-05 21:50:57	@Carson	yeah I was just thinking I'm not really a big trek fan
2015-11-05 21:51:23	@Carson	but they JJ Treks just don't work for me

2015-11-05 21:52:26	@Carson	the new SW looks like his best project so far, from the looks of it
2015-11-05 21:52:44	@Carson	but I'm just a fanboy inside :(
2015-11-05 21:53:07	@Carson	I'll probably start hating it after a while lol

2015-11-05 21:53:43	indeedwatson	heh
2015-11-05 21:53:44	AJ44	hello - i'm back
2015-11-05 21:53:54	AJ44	why don't you pay for tickets spooky ?
2015-11-05 21:54:06	indeedwatson	you can have guilty pleasures that you enjoy while inside you know they're 'ok' movies
2015-11-05 21:54:34	AJ44	being there was cute
2015-11-05 21:55:48	indeedwatson	why did you choose it
2015-11-05 21:57:11	AJ44	to watch?
2015-11-05 21:57:39	indeedwatson	yes
2015-11-05 21:57:52	AJ44	i don't know
2015-11-05 21:57:57	AJ44	i was going to watch it eventually
2015-11-05 21:58:08	AJ44	i guess it sat on my backlog for too long, and today was world cinema day
2015-11-05 21:58:23	AJ44	and I wrote an article with some colleagues from the webzine, and one of them mentioned this one
2015-11-05 21:58:30	AJ44	I had no previous knowledge of ashby's work
2015-11-05 21:58:39	AJ44	but this surely deserves a re-watch. have you seen it?
2015-11-05 21:58:50	indeedwatson	nope
2015-11-05 22:00:02	AJ44	well, you've seen 2001 space oddissey?
2015-11-05 22:00:41	indeedwatson	obviously
2015-11-05 22:01:28	AJ44	so, 2001 has some deep relation with thus sprach zarathrustra, or whatever that is spelt like
2015-11-05 22:01:51	AJ44	both the book by nietzche and strauss (?) composition (was it wagner? i'm not sure)
2015-11-05 22:02:12	indeedwatson	strauss
2015-11-05 22:02:22	AJ44	and in this one, there's a jazz cover of thus sprach zarathrustra, which is fun and adds to the scene's symbolism. that was a nice detail and I'm glad I spotted it :P
2015-11-05 22:02:22	indeedwatson	i mean that's the theme from the movie
2015-11-05 22:02:35	AJ44	ha, yeah
2015-11-05 22:02:53	indeedwatson	i've read nietzche but not that book yet
2015-11-05 22:03:10	AJ44	i'm inclined towards the interpretation of the ubermench in that film
2015-11-05 22:03:13	AJ44	i haven't read much
2015-11-05 22:03:21	AJ44	to be honest, I really like philosophy but I don't read much
2015-11-05 22:03:39	indeedwatson	AJ44: have you seen rob ager's analysis of 2001?
2015-11-05 22:03:41	AJ44	i've only read plato's apology, and a book on philosophy's history. some 60 pages of it
2015-11-05 22:03:46	AJ44	nope. is it good?
2015-11-05 22:04:34	indeedwatson	well he says something which was pretty mindblowing to me, and he provides enough evidence
2015-11-05 22:04:43	AJ44	hmm, don't spoil it to me
2015-11-05 22:04:45	indeedwatson	regardless is what he says is "true", i find it really interesting
2015-11-05 22:04:46	AJ44	i'll check it soon enough
2015-11-05 22:05:02	AJ44	have you seen the shining and its documentary? ?
2015-11-05 22:05:04	indeedwatson	do you want the link?
2015-11-05 22:05:26	indeedwatson	i've seen the shining but only a sort of mocking review of the docu
2015-11-05 22:05:27	AJ44	well sure, I'll add it to the reading list
2015-11-05 22:05:34	indeedwatson	it's a video

2015-11-05 22:05:47	AJ44	i'll add it to my watchlist instead then lol
2015-11-05 22:06:03	indeedwatson	clickbaity title lol
2015-11-05 22:06:09	AJ44	i have a very rudimentary interpretation of the monolith
2015-11-05 22:06:17	indeedwatson	have you seen the docu you mentioned?
2015-11-05 22:06:28	AJ44	to me, it stands as some sort of totem for the advancement of humankind
2015-11-05 22:06:31	AJ44	yes!
2015-11-05 22:06:38	AJ44	you should watch it, if you enjoyed the shining
2015-11-05 22:06:58	AJ44	what I mean is, it shows 7 or 8 totally different views and interpretations of the film
2015-11-05 22:07:04	AJ44	and a handful of those are pretty valid
2015-11-05 22:07:27	AJ44	i would say kubrick knew most of it was open to interpretation, and I find it very interesting
2015-11-05 22:07:39	indeedwatson	ager also has one about the shining
2015-11-05 22:07:40	AJ44	I should read some stuff on semiotics
2015-11-05 22:07:43	spooky	<AJ44> why don't you pay for tickets spooky ?
2015-11-05 22:07:47	spooky	i go to prescreenings
2015-11-05 22:08:01	indeedwatson	AJ44: also i've had most of the doc spoiled from that review
2015-11-05 22:08:07	spooky	i'm part of the WGA so as long as i have my badge i can see movies early :)
2015-11-05 22:08:14	AJ44	what's the WGA?
2015-11-05 22:08:26	AJ44	well you probbaly had indeedwatson
2015-11-05 22:08:40	AJ44	but it's worth watching. some theories are somewhat dumb
2015-11-05 22:08:52	indeedwatson	i watched most kubrick more than once i think
2015-11-05 22:09:00	spooky	WGA = writers guild of america
2015-11-05 22:09:08	AJ44	but there's also one that has become pretty famous, regarding kubrick's intervention on the staging of the moon landing
2015-11-05 22:09:18	indeedwatson	hah yeah i know that one
2015-11-05 22:09:18	AJ44	wait spooky are you american?
2015-11-05 22:09:41	AJ44	i wouldn't say I believe it, because I'm VERY skeptic of it
2015-11-05 22:09:55	AJ44	but you can surely read it from the film
2015-11-05 22:09:59	AJ44	and i think that's pretty cool

2015-11-05 22:10:55	indeedwatson	i should read a book about kubrick after sculpting in time
2015-11-05 22:11:03	spooky	lol AJ44: where did you think i was from?
2015-11-05 22:11:07	AJ44	haha yes! you told me about that book and it got me curious
2015-11-05 22:11:15	AJ44	i'm still reading lumet's, it's really good
2015-11-05 22:11:27	AJ44	but I won't read tarkovsky's at least until I watch more of his stuff
2015-11-05 22:11:34	indeedwatson	oh i also gotta read kurosawa's
2015-11-05 22:11:36	AJ44	but his films are daunting, very slow and demanding
2015-11-05 22:11:46	AJ44	I haven't watched any kurosawa besides Ikuru
2015-11-05 22:12:00	AJ44	spooky , i thought you were latin american. but maybe I got you mixed up with indeedwatson
2015-11-05 22:12:04	indeedwatson	i'm trying to up my ratio in karagarga just to download a decent 1080p rip of Stalker
2015-11-05 22:12:15	spooky	i think so
2015-11-05 22:12:16	indeedwatson	you haven't seen 7 samurai??
2015-11-05 22:12:19	AJ44	isn't it available on pass the popcorn?
2015-11-05 22:12:38	spooky	hehe i didn't know you guys were members @ those trackers
2015-11-05 22:13:08	AJ44	spooky you should have figured it out since you spotted me at wcd
2015-11-05 22:13:11	AJ44	nope I didn't
2015-11-05 22:13:22	indeedwatson	AJ44: i download most movies above 9gb
2015-11-05 22:13:27	AJ44	I'm not a member of karagarga, because I don't think it would be worth it
2015-11-05 22:13:33	AJ44	is the community good?
2015-11-05 22:13:47	indeedwatson	i don't know, im not very involved
2015-11-05 22:13:49	AJ44	btw spooky, how come are you a member of WGA? what do you do?
2015-11-05 22:13:49	spooky	probably not. all the trackers share movies now so there is no point
2015-11-05 22:14:09	indeedwatson	they have really obscure movies afaik
2015-11-05 22:14:14	spooky	kg used to be good
2015-11-05 22:14:41	spooky	but now they're all sharing movies with PTP, DH etc. so if you're a member of 1 you will find all the movies
2015-11-05 22:14:54	spooky	AJ44: i work in film
2015-11-05 22:14:58	indeedwatson	it's the only invite i got
2015-11-05 22:17:08	AJ44	what do you do?

2015-11-05 22:19:08	AJ44	haha
2015-11-05 22:19:22	AJ44	and we are being set up for an interview with scientology.
2015-11-05 22:19:32	indeedwatson	hahah
2015-11-05 22:19:57	AJ44	lol :p
2015-11-05 22:20:10	AJ44	i should also watch kubrick's lolita
2015-11-05 22:20:19	AJ44	i got curious after django told us about his work
2015-11-05 22:20:28	spooky	AJ44: i create sides, help do schedules, provide producer with coverage etc.
2015-11-05 22:20:40	indeedwatson	yeah i saw it too long ago and i hadn't read the book by then
2015-11-05 22:20:43	AJ44	oh! lumet wrote about your kind :P
2015-11-05 22:20:57	AJ44	i'm curious on how he adapted it
2015-11-05 22:21:34	AJ44	i'm going to watch ager's video
2015-11-05 22:21:58	indeedwatson	cool, lemme know what you think

2015-11-05 22:41:08	@Carson	is it public?
2015-11-05 22:41:31	@Carson	I figure I didn't nudge you because it didn't colorize your lowercase name in my IRC client
2015-11-05 22:42:22	indeedwatson	caps are irrelevant carSON
2015-11-05 22:42:35	@Carson	true
2015-11-05 22:43:04	AJ44	it won't colorize yours either when I put carson without the @
2015-11-05 22:43:05	@Carson	though I do like the satisfaction of colorizing
2015-11-05 22:43:06	AJ44	i'm not sure about it
2015-11-05 22:43:22	AJ44	indeedwatson, it's still very open for interpretation
2015-11-05 22:43:29	indeedwatson	that is client based
2015-11-05 22:43:34	indeedwatson	AJ44: yeah for sure
2015-11-05 22:43:50	AJ44	i might be overlooking a lot of things on his video, because I'm a bit tired and grumpy, but I wouldn't say he has a strong case on that interpretation
2015-11-05 22:44:13	AJ44	i'll rewatch it tomorrow with a clear head but...say it's a cinema screen. so what?
2015-11-05 22:44:24	AJ44	what does it imply?
2015-11-05 22:44:52	indeedwatson	didn't he touch on that?

2015-11-05 22:49:12	AJ44	I think he did. i'll rewatch it again
2015-11-05 22:49:15	AJ44	but I was expecting more
2015-11-05 22:49:32	AJ44	i don't buy him looking at the rectangle shapes and saying "oh - another monolith"
2015-11-05 22:49:48	AJ44	kubrick played a lot with symbolism, but not ALL of it was symbolism
2015-11-05 22:50:08	indeedwatson	i like the idea of the screen going black because we're looking at the monolith
2015-11-05 22:50:28	indeedwatson	and it's not as outlandish as thinking the moonlanding was fake :p
2015-11-05 22:50:42	AJ44	well yeah
2015-11-05 22:50:59	AJ44	i wouldn't say it's fake, its just you can see the reasoning behind the theory
2015-11-05 22:51:06	AJ44	but I don't know...
2015-11-05 22:51:38	AJ44	i'll stick with my interpretation from now, although, as I say, it's very rudimentary and, for example, I have no way to explain why the monolith shows up in the first place
2015-11-05 22:51:43	AJ44	ager doesn't either, so we're even on that
2015-11-05 22:52:25	AJ44	and it's a bit cringy when he reveals the grand meaning of it, as he then juxtaposes some fireworks and all haha
2015-11-05 22:52:27	indeedwatson	i thought it was either marking, or somehow helping further, the development of the human race
2015-11-05 22:52:42	AJ44	yes! nothing to do with a cinema screen
2015-11-05 22:52:59	AJ44	anyway, I'll sleep on it
2015-11-05 22:53:05	AJ44	and maybe rewatch it tomorrow

2015-11-05 22:55:29	indeedwatson	i've been several times, it is great, it spoils all other movie screens :(

2015-11-06 20:41:56	muskrat	hey
2015-11-06 20:42:01	AJ44	hello muskrat!
2015-11-06 20:42:15	muskrat	if you're into horror movies, then you might like this french movie called inside
2015-11-06 20:42:25	muskrat	but it's pretty fucked up, i'm warning you :)
2015-11-06 20:43:27	AJ44	had you been around here before muskrat ?
2015-11-06 20:43:53	muskrat	don't think i have, i've been to ##filmclub and ##cinema, though

2015-11-06 20:47:09	muskrat	:)
2015-11-06 20:47:10	AJ44	anyway, the films are Long Day's Journey Into Night (an adaptation of a play by Sidney Lumet)
2015-11-06 20:47:23	AJ44	Sunrise, a Song of Two Humans (russian film from 1927)
2015-11-06 20:47:34	AJ44	Dziga Vertov's Man With a Movie Camera
2015-11-06 20:47:44	AJ44	and By The Bluest of Seas (1936), russian as well
2015-11-06 20:48:02	AJ44	I just listened to a known Portuguese film critic and he mentioned all of these
2015-11-06 20:48:04	AJ44	except for lumets'
2015-11-06 20:48:57	muskrat	i don't think i've seen any of those
2015-11-06 20:49:18	muskrat	i do recommend the movie robot & frank, though
2015-11-06 20:50:10	muskrat	it's drama / sci fi / comedy, basically
2015-11-06 20:50:23	AJ44	let me check it
2015-11-06 20:50:30	muskrat	ok
2015-11-06 20:50:47	AJ44	haha seems interesting
2015-11-06 20:50:53	AJ44	a burglar robot?
2015-11-06 20:50:54	AJ44	:P
2015-11-06 20:51:49	muskrat	lol yeah, it's a pretty neat concept, imo
2015-11-06 20:53:21	muskrat	the guy who plays frank does a fine job too
2015-11-06 20:53:25	muskrat	can't recal his name
2015-11-06 20:53:28	muskrat	*recall
2015-11-06 20:55:45	muskrat	i wonder if this seedbox malfunction you mentioned is connected to YIFY going offline
2015-11-06 20:56:15	muskrat	probably not
2015-11-06 21:00:53	AJ44	what's YIFI?
2015-11-06 21:00:57	AJ44	YIFY*?
2015-11-06 21:04:23	muskrat	used to be one of the most active torrent distributors, as far as i know
2015-11-06 21:04:54	muskrat	but he/they made a deal with MPAA to avoid going to court
2015-11-06 21:13:18	AJ44	well, I don't know
2015-11-06 21:13:26	AJ44	what.cd is down, and PTP is a bit slow
2015-11-06 21:13:37	AJ44	but, then again, those are a bit esoteric films, with not so many seeders
2015-11-06 21:13:42	AJ44	silence of the lambs downloaded at a good speed!

2015-11-06 21:24:07	muskrat	his films can be kind of mindfuck-ish
2015-11-06 21:24:27	muskrat	:)
2015-11-06 21:24:42	AJ44	how so?
2015-11-06 21:25:07	AJ44	I really have no idea what to expect from him
2015-11-06 21:28:38	muskrat	he often explores darker, more animalistic aspects of the human experience
2015-11-06 21:29:00	muskrat	but the same could be said for many other directors as well
2015-11-06 21:29:13	muskrat	you'd really have to watch one of his films, for example the one about kasper hauser
2015-11-06 21:29:27	muskrat	that's one of my favorite herzog films
2015-11-06 21:29:50	muskrat	the enigma of kaspar hauser
2015-11-06 21:30:07	AJ44	i'll bookmark it
2015-11-06 21:30:12	muskrat	alright
2015-11-06 21:31:07	AJ44	where are you from?
2015-11-06 21:31:23	AJ44	"The film follows Kaspar Hauser (Bruno S.), who lived the first seventeen years of his life chained in a tiny cellar with only a toy horse to occupy his time, devoid of all human contact except for a man who wears a black overcoat and top hat who feeds him." whoa
2015-11-06 21:33:02	muskrat	AJ44, finland
2015-11-06 21:33:09	muskrat	you're from portugal, right?

2015-11-06 22:39:00	indeedwatson	does anyone sometimes see a really shitty movie and think "i could make a better than movie than this"
2015-11-06 22:50:13	AJ44	hmmm maybe
2015-11-06 22:50:21	AJ44	I have a lot of respect for film production
2015-11-06 22:56:06	AJ44	read lumet - it will blow your mind
2015-11-06 23:01:43	indeedwatson	me?
2015-11-06 23:21:08	tomflint	indeedwatson: you should get into the fanedit scene!
2015-11-06 23:23:12	indeedwatson	tomflint: i always thought that'd be fun
2015-11-06 23:26:48	AJ44	what is fanedit?
2015-11-06 23:33:10	tomflint	AJ44: there are people who recut / edit films to make new or improved versions
2015-11-06 23:33:18	tomflint	there's also a scene dedicated to restorations
2015-11-06 23:33:24	tomflint	do you like star wars, AJ44 ?
2015-11-06 23:33:33	AJ44	not really, no
2015-11-06 23:33:35	AJ44	i have only watched the first movie
2015-11-06 23:33:42	AJ44	anyway, I think that is very interesting
2015-11-06 23:33:55	AJ44	but it would be a lot better if we had access to all the shot scenes
2015-11-06 23:34:19	AJ44	it must be hard to work around editing work without the master shots. know what  I mean?
2015-11-06 23:34:31	tomflint	here's a good example of a restoration -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHfLX_TMduY

2015-11-06 23:35:21	tomflint	I watched Derelict -- which combines Prometheus and Alien to make one really great film
2015-11-06 23:35:42	@Carson	I got all the despecialized star wars
2015-11-06 23:35:57	tomflint	its sooooo goooood
2015-11-06 23:36:18	@Carson	yeah it's my preferred way to watch
2015-11-06 23:36:52	@Carson	also really high quality, I've never downloaded a 20gb video file
2015-11-06 23:37:45	tomflint	ha. I have a 20gb copy of The Rear Window -- which is the Harris Restoration, but with the bluray autio

2015-11-06 23:38:30	tomflint	the largest I've had is 50gb -- which automatically downloaded by mistake. haha

2015-11-06 23:38:42	@Carson	yeah I know, I wish i could do that, but it's not a good idea right now
2015-11-06 23:38:57	@Carson	for me
2015-11-06 23:41:10	indeedwatson	that despecialized version seems cool, almost makes me wish i cared enough about SW to rewatch them :p
2015-11-06 23:42:36	@Carson	yeah that's true
2015-11-06 23:42:44	@Carson	it's not that special
2015-11-06 23:43:06	@Carson	more of a cultural craze than anything
2015-11-06 23:45:56	AJ44	is it even worth watching the rest of the SW series, considering I didn't think anything much of episode IV?
2015-11-06 23:48:03	@Carson	Empire Strikes Back is a bit better
2015-11-06 23:52:00	@Carson	you know what franchise I can't stand
2015-11-06 23:52:12	@Carson	well theres a lot but
2015-11-06 23:52:23	@Carson	I get annoyed with Back to the Future
2015-11-06 23:52:44	@Carson	maybe because I've seen it to many times because it was always on tv as a kid
2015-11-06 23:53:05	@Carson	and it was a family members favorite film
2015-11-06 23:53:15	indeedwatson	pls get out

2015-11-06 23:53:22	@Carson	you like BTTF?
2015-11-06 23:53:25	@Carson	ugh
2015-11-06 23:53:35	@Carson	I'm sick of it
2015-11-06 23:53:52	indeedwatson	there wouldn't be R&M without BTTF
2015-11-06 23:53:54	@Carson	it's like when people say Forest Gump is their favorite film
2015-11-06 23:54:00	@Carson	I like R&M
2015-11-06 23:54:03	@Carson	can't stand BTTF
2015-11-06 23:57:53	@Carson	I'm also not a Harry Potter fan
2015-11-06 23:58:19	@Carson	I enjoyed the first 2 films as a kid, but just stopped caring after that
2015-11-06 23:58:35	indeedwatson	me neither
2015-11-06 23:58:45	indeedwatson	i read 3 or 4 of the books as a kid
2015-11-06 23:58:54	@Carson	I think I was more interested in Hogwarts than the characters
2015-11-06 23:59:26	@Carson	I'm interested in the spin off film
2015-11-07 00:00:06	@Carson	mainly because it won't be based on a book plot
2015-11-07 00:01:59	indeedwatson	i once considered watching the films with fresher eyes but decided against it
2015-11-07 00:03:57	AJ44	i loved it also, but I've only watched it this year

2015-11-09 12:21:35		[ http://is.gd/Yp552L ]
2015-11-09 12:30:47	AlexandreJ	that was a pretty nice discussion
2015-11-09 12:30:56	AlexandreJ	he has a valid point, i undestand his position
2015-11-09 12:44:59	indeedwatson	i disagree with that mindset he has
2015-11-09 12:45:04	indeedwatson	i might reply as well
2015-11-09 12:47:10	AlexandreJ	i didn't even touch on the "art must be social critique"
2015-11-09 12:47:15	AlexandreJ	The Master is not social critique
2015-11-09 12:47:28	AlexandreJ	and it would be pretty hard to find some in there. or maybe not, with the scientology thing et al
2015-11-09 12:47:41	AlexandreJ	what I kind of agree is that art is influenced by its times
2015-11-09 12:55:15	indeedwatson	i responded
2015-11-09 12:55:20	indeedwatson	and i touched on that
2015-11-09 12:56:41	AlexandreJ	his is a skewed argument ovrall
2015-11-09 12:56:44	AlexandreJ	overall*
2015-11-09 12:56:53	AlexandreJ	i really should read more about art, though
2015-11-09 12:57:04	AlexandreJ	it must be like film, but 10x
2015-11-09 12:57:24	indeedwatson	what do you mean
2015-11-09 12:58:16	AlexandreJ	film has 100 years of history
2015-11-09 12:58:21	AlexandreJ	more or less, counting only with the sound
2015-11-09 12:58:28	AlexandreJ	art has like...2000
2015-11-09 12:58:33	AlexandreJ	art in general
2015-11-09 12:58:39	AlexandreJ	paintings, sculpture, etc.
2015-11-09 12:58:56	AlexandreJ	the same patterns you might find interesting in film and music, etc. are present in art
2015-11-09 12:59:59	indeedwatson	yeah
2015-11-09 13:00:35	indeedwatson	but when you go back very far it's more like an anthropological study of it
2015-11-09 13:01:10	AlexandreJ	i find it so interesting

2015-11-09 16:09:06	@Carson	offer help?
2015-11-09 16:09:25	spooky	yeah using irc. i think lots of ppl are newbies when it comes to irc
2015-11-09 16:09:57	@Carson	yeah the web browser client helps
2015-11-09 16:10:19	@Carson	but if they want to stick around
2015-11-09 16:10:19	spooky	but its fine. i think with the web link its not necessary
2015-11-09 16:10:38	@Carson	it is preferred that they get a client

2015-11-09 16:31:13	AJ44	hello bstone12 !
2015-11-09 16:31:21	AJ44	it's such a good movie
2015-11-09 16:31:23	bstone12	okay so who here has seen the new gaspar noe film?
2015-11-09 16:31:26	bstone12	hi guys!
2015-11-09 16:31:28	Tennsoccerdr	It's on netflix and I was in the modd
2015-11-09 16:31:31	Tennsoccerdr	mood
2015-11-09 16:31:39	Tennsoccerdr	nope haven't seen it
2015-11-09 16:31:50	AJ44	i haven't seen it in a while as well, but I will surely when the time comes for a kubrick marathon
2015-11-09 16:31:58	AJ44	bstone12 , I haven't seen any of his. it's called love, right?
2015-11-09 16:32:02	AJ44	with that super provocative poster
2015-11-09 16:32:18	bstone12	yeah that's it
2015-11-09 16:32:29	bstone12	recently came out, like a week ago.
2015-11-09 16:32:41	@Carson	I've seen Irreversible and Into the Void
2015-11-09 16:32:58	bstone12	thoughts?
2015-11-09 16:33:28	AJ44	i wanted to watch into the void pretty high, but I haven't got around to it
2015-11-09 16:33:38	AJ44	i have a friend who's crazy about that film, though
2015-11-09 16:34:02	@Carson	it might be hard to put into words, but Noe definitely want to have a special experience
2015-11-09 16:34:36	bstone12	yeah very true, his films are a lot to take in
2015-11-09 16:34:46	bstone12	just the intro to enter the void is something else
2015-11-09 16:35:32	@Carson	Noe also likes to play with time and space
2015-11-09 16:35:49	@Carson	giving new perspectives that are often never shown on film
2015-11-09 16:35:55	AJ44	I have this idea, that into the void is like the 2001 psychedelic sequence but for a whole film
2015-11-09 16:36:27	bstone12	yeah plus noe is heavy influenced by kubrick

2015-11-09 16:37:50	--	AJ44 is now known as AlexandreJ
2015-11-09 16:38:06	bstone12	yeah go see 'Love'.Honestly, its great and terrible at the same time

2015-11-09 16:38:25	AlexJ44	are you undeadzombie12?
2015-11-09 16:38:31	bstone12	it plays like a lars von trier film.
2015-11-09 16:38:33	bstone12	haha yeah
2015-11-09 16:38:36	AlexJ44	oh okay
2015-11-09 16:38:38	AlexJ44	you posted
2015-11-09 16:38:47	AlexJ44	i read a bit, just before the spoils came in. i have just one question
2015-11-09 16:38:52	AlexJ44	have you seen la vie d'adele?
2015-11-09 16:39:12	bstone12	yeah, thats one of my favourite films
2015-11-09 16:39:42	AlexJ44	okay, so in terms of +18
2015-11-09 16:39:53	AlexJ44	which is more aggressive?
2015-11-09 16:40:21	bstone12	Love
2015-11-09 16:40:31	AlexJ44	oh
2015-11-09 16:40:36	bstone12	have you seen nymphomaniac
2015-11-09 16:40:41	bstone12	like part one and two?
2015-11-09 16:40:59	AlexJ44	nope
2015-11-09 16:41:02	AlexJ44	never seen any von trier
2015-11-09 16:41:17	bstone12	damn, well change that because he's great.
2015-11-09 16:41:21	Tennsoccerdr	Nympho was interesting those posters were gold
2015-11-09 16:41:29	AlexJ44	well yeah
2015-11-09 16:41:37	AlexJ44	I suppose so, everyone keeps talking about his work
2015-11-09 16:41:41	bstone12	just don't watch Love with any family members
2015-11-09 16:41:42	AlexJ44	he's very controversial, though
2015-11-09 16:41:54	AlexJ44	maybe a stepsister, if you're into that kind of stuff?
2015-11-09 16:41:57	AlexJ44	:P
2015-11-09 16:41:58	bstone12	because the opening scene is just straight sex for 5 minutes.
2015-11-09 16:42:29	AlexJ44	i'll get around to his films soon enough
2015-11-09 16:42:40	AlexJ44	tonight i'll be watching the cinema cut for fanny & alexander
2015-11-09 16:44:04	Tennsoccerdr	haven't seen it
2015-11-09 16:44:27	bstone12	Bergman is great.
2015-11-09 16:44:35	AlexJ44	i've seen a few of his movies
2015-11-09 16:44:57	AlexJ44	persona, wild strawberries, the seventh seal and through a glass darkly
2015-11-09 16:45:16	bstone12	persona is awesome.
2015-11-09 16:46:23	AlexJ44	hmm, i had a weird experience with it
2015-11-09 16:46:43	AlexJ44	when that ended, I got that feeling where I know there is a lot to it, but it just didn't resonate with me much

2015-11-09 17:02:27	@Carson	yeah welcome everyone
2015-11-09 17:02:37	thundercat	Treaclehorse, kendrick lamar is a rapper, he put out a pretty significant hip-hop album earlier this year, its called To Pimp a Butterfly, you should give it a listen if you are into that kind of music
2015-11-09 17:02:55	Toddler	Talking box-office and such has its place but it is such a pleasure to at least read some deepter duscussion
2015-11-09 17:03:00	thundercat	sorry for responding kinda late
2015-11-09 17:03:09	spooky	hi thundercat. i have listened to krendrick and i don't understand the accolades
2015-11-09 17:03:22	bstone12	yeah, like /r/movie is so boring and so one sided
2015-11-09 17:03:22	spooky	i love jazz and funk but his stuff doesn't grab me
2015-11-09 17:03:26	Toddler	...and now I am confused
2015-11-09 17:03:35	AlexJ44	you probably know about kamasi washington as well then

2015-11-09 17:04:01	AlexJ44	we are watching rancho notorious now
2015-11-09 17:04:01	@Carson	If you guys have some time, the 1952 film Rancho Notorious is starting in the truefilm theater
2015-11-09 17:04:06	spooky	thundercat: accolades means praise. when you like someone you say good things.
2015-11-09 17:04:28	@Carson	I've never heard this film, but I'm always slacking on Westerns
2015-11-09 17:04:30	bstone12	i would but ive got to back to work haha
2015-11-09 17:04:34	thundercat	hm, so you don't get what the fuzz is all about around kendrick?
2015-11-09 17:04:44	spooky	thundercat: that is correct
2015-11-09 17:04:45	bstone12	im procrastinating so hard right now
2015-11-09 17:04:54	Toddler	I would too but I have to get back in 20 minutes
2015-11-09 17:05:01	bstone12	this is now, truemusic.
2015-11-09 17:05:10	AlexJ44	hello spooky!
2015-11-09 17:05:15	indeedwatson	i haven't seen enough westerns
2015-11-09 17:05:23	indeedwatson	i really liked The Proposition
2015-11-09 17:05:29	spooky	hello AlexJ44
2015-11-09 17:05:50	Toddler	So let's try to swerve into a non-Kendrick direction. Anyone want to share their current most-anticipated film?
2015-11-09 17:06:09	spooky	the new film with leo di caprio
2015-11-09 17:06:12	spooky	i forget the title
2015-11-09 17:06:12	bstone12	Carol
2015-11-09 17:06:16	Stricken157	Star wars...
2015-11-09 17:06:16	spooky	but it looks good
2015-11-09 17:06:20	indeedwatson	hmm, maybe the new scorcese about Leonard Berstein
2015-11-09 17:06:21	spooky	am anticipating that
2015-11-09 17:06:23	Toddler	For me it has to be Anomolisa. Star Wars will be great, but that trailer for Anomolisa had me hooked right away
2015-11-09 17:06:30	indeedwatson	or Villeneuve\s Blade Runner
2015-11-09 17:06:30	thundercat	i'm probably going to see "youth" sometime soon
2015-11-09 17:06:32	bstone12	oh the relevant or whatever
2015-11-09 17:06:34	@Carson	I want to see Carol
2015-11-09 17:06:34	indeedwatson	Toddler: oth that too!
2015-11-09 17:06:37	spooky	yes
2015-11-09 17:06:38	AlexJ44	hmmm
2015-11-09 17:06:47	thundercat	also anomolisa, yes!
2015-11-09 17:06:48	Toddler	What's Carol?
2015-11-09 17:06:48	Stricken157	Probably going to be disappointing
2015-11-09 17:06:50	spooky	Carson: i think you guessed the title correct
2015-11-09 17:06:52	AlexJ44	i'm not sure
2015-11-09 17:06:58	spooky	but i might be unsure
2015-11-09 17:07:00	thundercat	has anyone seen "the lobster"?
2015-11-09 17:07:03	spooky	the film looks interesting to me
2015-11-09 17:07:04	AlexJ44	I'm not really following the trends, but I'm curious about the oscar film
2015-11-09 17:07:09	Toddler	No. Would like to
2015-11-09 17:07:09	AlexJ44	i mean, the film about the chess players

2015-11-09 17:07:44	thundercat	toddler: if you like lanthimos' older work, you'd definitely like lobster as well
2015-11-09 17:07:48	bstone12	also, macbeth looks awesome, but my friend saw it and said its a chore just to watch.
2015-11-09 17:07:50	AlexJ44	i haven't heard of carol, I believe
2015-11-09 17:07:57	Toddler	Carol does sound good.

2015-11-09 17:55:46	@Carson	imdb ratings are awful
2015-11-09 17:55:46	thundercat	whats your fav PTA film?
2015-11-09 17:56:08	Porkepik	AlexJ44, yeah this is what i like since i started watching a lot of movies, especially old one and getting interested with filmmaking, i can have my own opinion and i feel like i'm decent at analyzing movies
2015-11-09 17:56:08	@Carson	probably There Will Be Blood, The Master, and Magnolia
2015-11-09 17:56:18	@Carson	that's top 3 in no order

2015-11-09 17:56:31	thundercat	haha, @Carson, those would be my picks as well :)

2015-11-09 17:57:47	AlexJ44	yeah, that happens
2015-11-09 17:57:53	AlexJ44	I really enjoyed her

2015-11-09 17:58:08	thundercat	her was good, yeah
2015-11-09 17:58:20	AlexJ44	not because of jonze's technical ability, just just because of the story and the scenery
2015-11-09 17:58:23	AlexJ44	some films just work like that
2015-11-09 17:58:45	Porkepik	i saw on the post about the irc, i think it's you AlexJ44 (look like your username), you talked about Film Critic Hulk, it's a blog about movie critics ?
2015-11-09 17:58:46	AlexJ44	no need to be analysing them further
2015-11-09 17:58:50	thundercat	who would you say impresses you for their technical ability?
2015-11-09 17:59:12	AlexJ44	haha film critic hulk is someone we all (or most of us) enjoy
2015-11-09 17:59:28	AlexJ44	it's a film critic, who hasn't yet (or maybe never will) reveal his/her true identify

2015-11-09 18:00:56	AlexJ44	so sometimes we discuss his essays on film. there's a very good one on Mullholand drive, if you have ever watched it. if not, it's has a lot of spoilers

2015-11-09 18:01:22	AlexJ44	as for the films that impress me technically...I don't know, really. For a while, i would pay a lot of attention to that
2015-11-09 18:01:42	AlexJ44	today has been a busy day FlargBikernes
2015-11-09 18:01:45	AlexJ44	a lot of new people!
2015-11-09 18:02:03	FlargBikernes	Kiwi Irc is so nice compared to Mibbit.
2015-11-09 18:02:04	AlexJ44	but now I'll pay more attention to the film's intention as a whole...I don't know
2015-11-09 18:02:13	Porkepik	thundercat, haven't watch any of his films, will check it out soon
2015-11-09 18:02:15	AlexJ44	as for your question thundercat , is he the one who directed force majeure?
2015-11-09 18:02:23	Porkepik	btw sorry if my english doesn't make sense, not my native language
2015-11-09 18:02:28	thundercat	he is

2015-11-09 18:02:58	AlexJ44	hmm...it made a lot more sense after I realised some of it was supposed to be comedy

2015-11-09 18:05:09	thundercat	ruben talked about where the general idea of the film came from, he talked about statistics which say that divorce rates among people who were a part of a plane hijacking were super high after the hijacking itself
2015-11-09 18:05:38	AlexJ44	yeah
2015-11-09 18:05:44	AlexJ44	I feel he explored a lot of tense situations in that film
2015-11-09 18:05:59	Porkepik	are plane hijacking so frequent we can have a good sample to make it an interesting stat ? ^^
2015-11-09 18:06:10	AlexJ44	when I mean comedy parts, I mean that part where he's loudly crying at the door of the room
2015-11-09 18:06:23	AlexJ44	haha good point Porkepik
2015-11-09 18:06:34	Zaiso	hmm that sounds like a really interesting origin of the film
2015-11-09 18:06:50	AlexJ44	have you seen it Zaiso ? it will make much more sense if you have
2015-11-09 18:06:55	thundercat	i agree about the exploration stuff
2015-11-09 18:06:57	Porkepik	sometimes the dumbest things give you the best ideas
2015-11-09 18:07:02	Zaiso	i have not but i'm really interested now
2015-11-09 18:07:03	thundercat	he's pretty interested in the generally perceived roles of men and women in society, men always being portrayed as the hero, women being portrayed as sex objects etc etc
2015-11-09 18:07:11	Zaiso	i'll give add it to my list
2015-11-09 18:07:18	Porkepik	like your young sister saying something random, or an ad
2015-11-09 18:07:20	AlexJ44	yeah - that's definitely one of the points of the film
2015-11-09 18:08:20	AlexJ44	it was an interesting film
2015-11-09 18:08:25	Porkepik	Might try to watch the movie tonight, i was looking trough my watchlist
2015-11-09 18:08:36	thundercat	@portkepik, he talked about other statistics as well, like how many adults would interfere if they saw a robbery between children in the center of a big city and how the behaviour of adults towards children has changed a lot from 30 years ago
2015-11-09 18:08:39	AlexJ44	do you guys have letterboxd profiles or something?
2015-11-09 18:08:56	thundercat	one of his earlier films is about that exactly
2015-11-09 18:09:10	Porkepik	thundercat, ok gonna watch it now
2015-11-09 18:09:17	Porkepik	Force majeur right ?
2015-11-09 18:09:18	thundercat	he is pretty interested in social studies and stuff i guess
2015-11-09 18:09:21	thundercat	yep
2015-11-09 18:09:27	Porkepik	majeure* fuck i'm french can't ever write it well

2015-11-09 18:10:54	AlexJ44	well, it's a bit more clean and social, I would say
2015-11-09 18:11:05	thundercat	@porkepik i should warn you though, he has a very static style, a 2 hour film is composed of probably 100 shots
2015-11-09 18:11:43	Zaiso	looking at letterbox now which reminded me
2015-11-09 18:11:48	Zaiso	what did you guys think of sicario?
2015-11-09 18:11:58	AlexJ44	i haven't yet watched it
2015-11-09 18:11:59	FlargBikernes	Not seen it yet, what's it about?
2015-11-09 18:11:59	Porkepik	thundercat, ok well i'm used to movies like that, i don't think i will mind something a little bit experimental
2015-11-09 18:12:08	FlargBikernes	Hispanic assassins?
2015-11-09 18:12:09	thundercat	haven't seen it, big fan of prisoners and enemy though
2015-11-09 18:12:09	Zaiso	I saw it but unfortunately not many of my friends saw it
2015-11-09 18:12:11	thundercat	especially enemy
2015-11-09 18:12:21	AlexJ44	i didn't enjoy enemy much

2015-11-09 18:12:33	Zaiso	yeup hispanic and i really enjoyed prisoners

2015-11-09 18:13:17	thundercat	as long as mom doesn't find out
2015-11-09 18:13:23	AlexJ44	it was fine, but I didn't enjoy the metaphoric part of it
2015-11-09 18:13:29	FlargBikernes	Can you say cunt? I got banned off an American-centric chatroom for using it frequently.
2015-11-09 18:13:38	AlexJ44	the whole spider thing and the unlinear narrative
2015-11-09 18:13:43	AlexJ44	well, you just said it
2015-11-09 18:13:50	FlargBikernes	DAMN.

2015-11-09 18:13:57	@Carson	yeah I surprised about how much I liked Prisoners
2015-11-09 18:14:02	Porkepik	btw, as a french i find it weird that curses are taken so seriously
2015-11-09 18:14:07	Porkepik	in france, many family movies are full of curses
2015-11-09 18:14:24	FlargBikernes	I'm from Ireland, It's hard to go a sentence without shoving a cunt or a bastard in there somewhere.

2015-11-09 18:15:17	thundercat	@AlexJ44, its actually an adaptation of a short story by one of my favourite authors. chris stuckman did an explanation video of enemy on his channel, have you checked that out? its pretty much his take on it, guided me personally towards understanding the film
2015-11-09 18:15:27	AlexJ44	i haven't

2015-11-09 18:17:21	Zaiso	I feel the same way thundercat
2015-11-09 18:17:29	Zaiso	he's been sticking to the mainstream films a lot more recently
2015-11-09 18:17:36	thundercat	exactly!
2015-11-09 18:17:39	Zaiso	thumbs up for YMS as well
2015-11-09 18:17:46	Zaiso	it's a shame he's been really busy recently
2015-11-09 18:17:46	AlexJ44	yes
2015-11-09 18:17:54	AlexJ44	who's YMS?
2015-11-09 18:17:57	thundercat	and i feel like his reviews have become more generic, i feel like sometimes he has much more to say about a film but doesn't just so he doesn't piss off some people

2015-11-09 18:18:33	AlexJ44	i know needledrop
2015-11-09 18:18:35	Zaiso	and he says for the purposes of his channel the mainstream films are the most reliable and consistent

2015-11-09 18:20:46	thundercat	he talks about different stuff, not necessarily album reviews

2015-11-09 18:21:12	Zyllber	Cool, my favorite film is easily "Brazil" by Terry Gilliam, what about you?
2015-11-09 18:21:22	Zaiso	haha yea pork i agree i like his reviews for certain genres of music
2015-11-09 18:21:28	AlexJ44	oh! i've seen that one
2015-11-09 18:21:29	Zaiso	:D Zyllber i love Brazil
2015-11-09 18:21:38	Zyllber	Its a movie worth loving
2015-11-09 18:21:47	Porkepik	yeah, i'm sure i know nothing about music compare to him
2015-11-09 18:21:48	Zaiso	i've probably seen it four times now and it gets better everytime
2015-11-09 18:22:12	Zyllber	Yeah, theres just so much to discover in it
2015-11-09 18:22:18	Porkepik	but i like electronic music and he likes some knowledge about that i think, but i should watch more of his stuff
2015-11-09 18:22:20	AlexJ44	to be honest, i found it to drag a bit sometimes

2015-11-09 18:25:38	thundercat	good choice mate
2015-11-09 18:25:45	Zaiso	my favourite recent film is whiplash
2015-11-09 18:25:51	Porkepik	yeah i will try not to forget to start mirc every day, i need more irc in my life
2015-11-09 18:25:54	Zyllber	Great film
2015-11-09 18:26:03	Porkepik	last scene of whiplash was Kreygasm
2015-11-09 18:26:04	thundercat	pretty good film
2015-11-09 18:26:09	Zyllber	Really made me appreciate drums in jazz more
2015-11-09 18:26:12	Porkepik	(sorry for use of twitch emote :D)
2015-11-09 18:26:23	Zaiso	haha kappa
2015-11-09 18:26:33	Zyllber	I think Whiplash really excels in editing, especially towards the end
2015-11-09 18:26:41	Zaiso	but yea after whiplash i watched an hour on youtube of jazz drummers was crazy

2015-11-09 18:27:06	Zaiso	I really liked how whiplash felt very contained which gave more room to grow for miles
2015-11-09 18:27:16	thundercat	funny thing about that movie, after i've told numerous people how much i love it, some of my friends that play music told me they didn't like it that much because it represents playing music and especially playing jazz music wrong
2015-11-09 18:27:18	Zaiso	kinda comes from the fact that the film was filmed in a really short time

2015-11-09 18:27:49	Zyllber	Really thundercat ? I have a friend who is a professional jazz musician and he said he loved it. Well, different people i guess
2015-11-09 18:27:49	Zaiso	I think the director who made whiplash made another one about a concert pianist right?
2015-11-09 18:28:03	thundercat	they didn't like how competitive they made jazz look like
2015-11-09 18:28:18	thundercat	and the director was actually a drum player in his college years
2015-11-09 18:28:20	Zyllber	Oh, is that such a problem for them?

2015-11-09 18:45:55	Porkepik	can i import anything like rating from imdb from letterboxd or i need to do it manually ?
2015-11-09 18:45:58	Porkepik	i guess manually ...

2015-11-09 18:49:02	@Carson	porkepik talking about importing reviews, I think there is a paid version on Letterboxd, which are allowed to import from imdb
2015-11-09 18:49:09	fitemil	I noticed something the other day that kind of crept up over the last 10+ years

2015-11-09 18:49:43	fitemil	when I joined the imdb, ca 1998, the top250 was almost entirely made up of "canon" films pretty evenly spread across the last 70 years
2015-11-09 18:49:47	Porkepik	Carson, yeah just saw their pro version
2015-11-09 18:50:05	fitemil	the kind of thing you would see on any critic's list, or in a 1001 movies type book
2015-11-09 18:50:15	tomflint	fitemil: its because there are more people voting and everyone either votes 10 or 2
2015-11-09 18:50:28	Porkepik	mainstream taste (not that i'm a hispter or what)
2015-11-09 18:50:31	fitemil	but at some point the top250 got renewed - now it seems to be very heavily skewed towards the last 10 years
2015-11-09 18:50:48	fitemil	tomflint: sure, but I'm going somewhere with this

2015-11-09 18:51:14	fitemil	10 years ago it was pretty much 100% hollywood, Kurosawa, and european art films
2015-11-09 18:51:26	Porkepik	the worst is how american it is ... i'm sorry i'm gonna do my french master race but seriously it's lacking some european movies
2015-11-09 18:51:44	fitemil	haha
2015-11-09 18:51:50	fitemil	but here's the thing
2015-11-09 18:52:11	fitemil	lately indian and turkish films have been creeping in
2015-11-09 18:52:18	fitemil	I think the turkish films are ballot stuffing

2015-11-09 18:56:35	Porkepik	at the top you find a lot of pixar and disney movie
2015-11-09 18:56:49	tomflint	on my spreadsheet I average out IMDB, RT Critics, RT civilians, and MetaCritic

2015-11-09 19:01:38	Porkepik	fitemil => Well, i usually give better ratings to old movies cause they had less knowledge and norms about film making
2015-11-09 19:01:55	fitemil	interesting
2015-11-09 19:02:22	fitemil	but I also think that whoever watches an older film is likely to be more knowledgeable on average

2015-11-09 19:19:06	BRCinephile	Mommy?
2015-11-09 19:19:08	BRCinephile	Dolan?
2015-11-09 19:19:11	@Carson	what did you think about Mommy
2015-11-09 19:19:13	for4saken	Same, just saw the post
2015-11-09 19:19:14	radbuscus	yeah, first Dolan movie
2015-11-09 19:19:26	Connoronnor	I've only seen Heartbeats
2015-11-09 19:19:31	Connoronnor	Is it worth the watch?
2015-11-09 19:19:38	radbuscus	really liked it, can't wait to get around to seeing his other work

2015-11-09 19:19:52	BRCinephile	It is impressive that he made it with 20 or 21 years
2015-11-09 19:19:56	radbuscus	yeah, I mean I really enjoyed it
2015-11-09 19:20:29	radbuscus	yeah, couldn't believe when I saw how old he was

2015-11-09 19:21:09	radbuscus	the only movie I've ever seen in a 1:1 ratio
2015-11-09 19:21:10	Connoronnor	Very obvious Godard influence
2015-11-09 19:21:32	radbuscus	but it really made sense for it to be this way
2015-11-09 19:22:01	BRCinephile	I think Dolan just need to work with a better editor
2015-11-09 19:22:20	BRCinephile	Some of his movies seem to long without reason
2015-11-09 19:22:24	Connoronnor	It'll be interesting to see how his work develops once he loses the whole "wunderkind" label as he moves into his older years
2015-11-09 19:22:29	for4saken	1:1? That's unusual. How long did it take to be comfortable with it?
2015-11-09 19:22:52	BRCinephile	Yeah Connoronnor, I think that maybe in 10 years he could be really great

2015-11-09 20:34:25	indeedwatson	i tried watching one of his films long ago and gave up :/ it wasn't even that long
2015-11-09 20:34:45	indeedwatson	but i think i'd have a different perspective now
2015-11-09 20:36:01	RyanSmallwood	Bela Tarr's films always start out slow and pay off a lot later
2015-11-09 20:37:04	RyanSmallwood	if you commit to the amount of time and say "Alright I'll sit here even if Bela Tarr just shows me shots of cows for hours" I think you're in the right mindset and you'll be pleasantly surprised
2015-11-09 20:37:22	indeedwatson	hah
2015-11-09 20:37:29	indeedwatson	yeah i will do that in the near future
2015-11-09 20:37:34	indeedwatson	not sure if with satantango yet
2015-11-09 20:39:39	Card74	Tarr was cool, he kept cheering the audience on as we watched Satantango
2015-11-09 20:39:44	Card74	One of these days I'm going to bookmark these goo.gl shortlinks, navigating these is pain
2015-11-09 20:41:13	RyanSmallwood	I've heard some funny stories about Tarr, like telling everyone in a Turin Horse screening that they should all leave because its a beautiful day outside instead of watching his depressing movie
2015-11-09 20:41:50	Card74	haha, yeah

2015-11-09 20:50:04	Porkepik	it's a place where people try to get likes but making short and baitclick review with popular or unpopular opinions
2015-11-09 20:50:12	Porkepik	but not fair ! it has to be one opposite
2015-11-09 20:50:22	Dema	Ah. No wonder I've never really checked it out
2015-11-09 20:50:47	Dema	I'm actually not one to read movie reviews too often. Which is probably something I should've waited to admit here.
2015-11-09 20:51:17	Porkepik	well depends on the reviewers, but don't try to find them on imdb, letterboxd or even reddit
2015-11-09 20:51:32	indeedwatson	hahah 63/100
2015-11-09 20:51:45	Dema	I much prefer discussion and interaction. So I'm sure I'll be alright here.
2015-11-09 20:51:54	indeedwatson	i barely use the stars there, i just log movies to keep track of them

2015-11-09 20:54:53	Card74	I just use IMDb's lists for that. Too many accounts in too many review / recommendation sites already - better stick to the database itself...

2015-11-09 20:56:33	BRCinephile	Brazil
2015-11-09 20:56:47	Dema	I was just hanging out with a Brazilian who moved here
2015-11-09 20:57:26	BRCinephile	I hope she/he is not a true brazilian
2015-11-09 20:57:31	BRCinephile	otherwise, I'm really sorry

2015-11-09 20:59:47	BRCinephile	I really love it
2015-11-09 20:59:55	BRCinephile	but i'm a Danny Boyle fan
2015-11-09 21:00:24	BRCinephile	I'd recommend it
2015-11-09 21:00:30	Porkepik	i actually was not a big fan of it ...
2015-11-09 21:00:33	Card74	It's ok, worth watching if you get the chance
2015-11-09 21:00:39	Porkepik	i think the movie should have ended sooner
2015-11-09 21:01:01	Dema	I heard it was a bit far fetched
2015-11-09 21:01:09	Dema	And Boyle is really hit or miss with me.
2015-11-09 21:01:26	BRCinephile	Well, this reminds me that I haven't watched Trance
2015-11-09 21:01:33	indeedwatson	i watched it in theater and enjoyed it, but i'm not compelled to watch it again
2015-11-09 21:01:33	BRCinephile	gonna do it in the next few days
2015-11-09 21:01:39	indeedwatson	BRCinephile: are you from brasil?
2015-11-09 21:01:56	indeedwatson	oh i just read up lol

2015-11-09 21:02:31	indeedwatson	im from argentina, i think we're the only south americans so far
2015-11-09 21:02:39	BRCinephile	nice!
2015-11-09 21:02:47	Dema	So are there any rules when discussing films in regards to spoilers or is it just kind of a free for all?
2015-11-09 21:02:56	BRCinephile	actually, i live in a city which borders Argentina and Paraguay
2015-11-09 21:03:05	BRCinephile	You're from Buenos Aires?
2015-11-09 21:03:06	indeedwatson	Dema: i think we should give warnings

2015-11-09 21:03:28	indeedwatson	i have an online friend in goiania
2015-11-09 21:03:46	Dema	Sounds good. Figured I'd ask. Thanks, indeedwatson.

2015-11-09 21:08:13	indeedwatson	hmm could be
2015-11-09 21:08:42	indeedwatson	yeah it could work, we'll see when something potentially spoilery comes up

2015-11-09 21:09:31	BRCinephile	there is a new Trapero movie who is making success in Argentina, right?
2015-11-09 21:10:10	Card74	I was an op at EFnet's #movies for years, before one of the US ops went insane. It's entirely possible to avoid the spoilers, take it to /msg or another channel...

2015-11-09 21:17:39	indeedwatson	obviously i've seen City of God, tho a long time ago
2015-11-09 21:17:47	indeedwatson	and bus... 147? something like that
2015-11-09 21:17:57	Dema	City of God is amazing
2015-11-09 21:18:30	Dema	Strictly due to the acting from all the kids
2015-11-09 21:18:33	Card74	Constant raving about it... and very unstable, I was worried that he might hurt someone
2015-11-09 21:18:34	indeedwatson	yeah i really gotta rewatch it
2015-11-09 21:18:45	indeedwatson	BRCinephile: and elite squad 1 and 2
2015-11-09 21:18:49	Dema	But also stylistically it was great
2015-11-09 21:19:21	Porkepik	Card74, but i don't understand, just the event ? i mean it was shocking but was he living in NY ?
2015-11-09 21:19:29	Dema	That sucks Card74. I have family who think Sandy Hook never happened
2015-11-09 21:19:39	BRCinephile	nice, good films
2015-11-09 21:19:56	Card74	I think he was at east coast
2015-11-09 21:19:59	RyanSmallwood	the Brazilian silent film Limite is pretty astounding
2015-11-09 21:20:11	Card74	not sure about NYC any more
2015-11-09 21:20:13	indeedwatson	BRCinephile: basically i think i only saw these 3 br films lol, but i only saw 1 or 2 from ar
2015-11-09 21:20:36	BRCinephile	Limite is pretty famous (out of Brazil, nowhere here ever heard of it)
2015-11-09 21:20:59	Dema	NYC has very strict gun laws
2015-11-09 21:21:16	Dema	So I would assume outside of the city.
2015-11-09 21:21:44	Dema	I finally saw Metropolis for the first time.
2015-11-09 21:21:50	BRCinephile	nowhere = nobody*
2015-11-09 21:21:57	Dema	I really enjoyed it.
2015-11-09 21:22:09	indeedwatson	still have to see that
2015-11-09 21:22:12	BRCinephile	Which version?
2015-11-09 21:22:21	Dema	The latest version
2015-11-09 21:22:30	Dema	2010 I believe
2015-11-09 21:23:20	Dema	It was definitely the one with the New Zealand and Argentinian footage.
2015-11-09 21:23:22	Card74	aargh, my Metropolis disc is still on the shelf... somehow I never find the time to watch my movies
2015-11-09 21:23:52	*	Card74 feels guilty
2015-11-09 21:23:53	BRCinephile	Card74: this is sad
2015-11-09 21:23:59	Dema	It's a great movie for one of those nights where you can't sleep
2015-11-09 21:24:09	BRCinephile	Card74: some years ago I could watch 3, 4 movies a day...now I hardly watch 1
2015-11-09 21:24:36	Dema	I used to watch movies with my best mate everyday after our Uni classes
2015-11-09 21:24:42	Dema	Then I moved to England :(
2015-11-09 21:24:55	Card74	At least I finally watched The rules of the game, about 4 years after I bought the Criterion dvd...
2015-11-09 21:24:56	indeedwatson	my friends don't have the same taste for some movies as me
2015-11-09 21:25:05	Card74	baby steps...
2015-11-09 21:25:11	Dema	I was lucky in that aspect indeedwatson

2015-11-09 21:35:40	TheManWithNoNick	I want to talk about Marvel and DC

2015-11-09 21:36:30	Porkepik	TheManWithNoNick, yeah of course ... and pixars are the new kubricks right ? ^^
2015-11-09 21:36:42	Dema	Porkepik: lol

2015-11-09 21:37:11	TheManWithNoNick	I believe if you plot out the timing and frequency of the punches in Man of Steel, you get a Morse Code message
2015-11-09 21:37:33	Card74	Bah, I like the MCU. Of course, I've been reading Marvel for 30 years...
2015-11-09 21:37:59	Dema	I kinda see how someone could say superhero movies are the new westerns. But it's really kinda splaying the style out and removing everything about it that makes it a "western"
2015-11-09 21:38:06	Porkepik	Guardians of the galaxy was cool tho
2015-11-09 21:38:13	Porkepik	the rest is shit ...
2015-11-09 21:38:37	TheManWithNoNick	With Westerns, we had Ford and Leone. With Superheros, we have Nolan and Synder. They are all equals.
2015-11-09 21:38:53	Porkepik	Nolan doesn't really do "superheroes"
2015-11-09 21:38:57	Porkepik	batman is a hero, doesn't have power
2015-11-09 21:39:27	TheManWithNoNick	He has the greatest power of all. Incoherent growling.
2015-11-09 21:39:52	Porkepik	and those sexy push ups <3
2015-11-09 21:40:01	Dema	I really feel like Man Of Steel had some really good things going for it.
2015-11-09 21:40:18	TheManWithNoNick	Even Superman would be struck dumb if Bale yelled WHARSDATRIGAR  at him.
2015-11-09 21:40:22	Dema	But maybe if someone other than Snyder had directed it...

2015-11-09 21:51:29	Dema	Yeah. That's how I felt about Youth In Revolt
2015-11-09 21:51:41	Porkepik	the movie is too fast, i get he had budget issue and this is still a good movie
2015-11-09 21:52:05	indeedwatson	im still hurt about snyder doing watchmen instead of terry gilliam
2015-11-09 21:52:43	Dema	As someone who read about 1/4 of the comic, I really enjoyed the movie.

2015-11-09 21:53:16	AlexJ44	just finished the film
2015-11-09 21:53:21	indeedwatson	how was it
2015-11-09 21:53:34	TheManWithNoNick	How many punches were thrown?
2015-11-09 21:53:36	Porkepik	my issue is that scott pilgrim in the movie looks like he is socially awkard but in the comic he is pretty normal and you understand he doesn't struggle to get good looking gfs
2015-11-09 21:53:39	AlexJ44	not sure. intense
2015-11-09 21:53:42	AlexJ44	i feel the 6h version must explain a lot more

2015-11-09 21:54:27	Dema	And also you don't get to see him develop a relationship with Ramona
2015-11-09 21:54:32	Dema	He's mostly just infatuated.
2015-11-09 21:54:50	Dema	I did enjoy Cera having a bit of a more confident role.
2015-11-09 21:54:53	Porkepik	indeedwatson, i'm not talking about his face etc ... in the movie he is weird socially, in the comic he is normal
2015-11-09 21:55:06	indeedwatson	true

2015-11-09 22:06:20	AlexJ44	crayons, I had it downloaded because of that TF thread. I didn't even read it, I was planning on watching the film and then read the thread
2015-11-09 22:06:21	crayons	it's really dependent on the film in question as to why it's important. Maybe it's a hard to find print that was restored, maybe it's got commentary, maybe it's got documentary features, maybe the art was done by a famous artist,   maybe it has cultural relevance that goes beyond anything that we'll understand unless we know our history
2015-11-09 22:06:32	indeedwatson	AlexJ44: no, i only upvoted you haha, i tend not to upvote or downvote at all

2015-11-09 22:19:03	AlexJ44	"t is sad to think that many have only seen the 188 minute 'Theatrical Cut' which saw much of the fantasy elements that Bergman stated was particularly troubling: “as I had to cut into the nerves and lifeblood of the film.”. I could not imagine Fanny and Alexander to be complete without some of these more memorable elements where ghosts and magic exist in the same space as reality, sometimes haunting and sometimes comforting the

2015-11-09 22:20:53	AlexJ44	6h
2015-11-09 22:20:57	crayons	I wanna watch Persona

2015-11-09 22:21:03	Card74	Start with Wild Strawberries, I'd say
2015-11-09 22:21:07	noiseworld	Persona is far more accessible than his others IMO.
2015-11-09 22:21:08	AlexJ44	but really, I don't think those are the better ones to start

2015-11-09 22:27:20	AlexJ44	I'm a bit put off by persona, in the sense that it's a bit denser than others
2015-11-09 22:27:34	indeedwatson	fair enough, i was talking about the movie itself and its qualities
2015-11-09 22:28:13	crayons	I didn't understand why Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon was so highly regarded until like 2 years ago

2015-11-09 22:29:31	crayons	alexj44 Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is about a lot of things. It's about a sword and a bunch of people who want to take it from the person who wants to give it up. It's a lot deeper than that tho.

2015-11-09 22:30:12	AlexJ44	"“When a film is not a document, it is a dream. . . . At the editing table, when I run the strip of film through, frame by frame, I still feel that dizzy sense of magic of my childhood.” Bergman, who has conveyed this heady sense of wonder and vision to moviegoers for decades, traces his lifelong love affair with film in his breathtakingly visual autobiography" The Magic Lantern."

2015-11-09 22:45:46	AlexJ44	btw carson, i stayed up in the theater for a while
2015-11-09 22:45:55	AlexJ44	at some point, I was alone there with a guest, even monty had left
2015-11-09 22:45:59	AlexJ44	I felt so bad
2015-11-09 22:46:08	@Carson	nice, it didn't seem too busy yeah
2015-11-09 22:46:14	AlexJ44	we should show up en masse the next time
2015-11-09 22:46:18	@Carson	it happens a lot I'm sure
2015-11-09 22:46:26	AlexJ44	being empty? sure does
2015-11-09 22:46:31	@Carson	well tonight at 9 is another showing
2015-11-09 22:46:40	@Carson	15 minutes
2015-11-09 22:46:44	AlexJ44	maybe that's a bit more active, as it's appealing to another timezone
2015-11-09 22:46:54	Dema	What's playing?
2015-11-09 22:47:04	AlexJ44	fritz lang's western film
2015-11-09 22:47:09	@Carson	Rancho something
2015-11-09 22:47:14	AlexJ44	Rancho Notorious
2015-11-09 22:47:15	Dema	I think I tried joining the theater once and then ended up watching Twilight Zone episodes.
2015-11-09 22:47:25	@Carson	i never knew Lang did a western
2015-11-09 22:47:42	AlexJ44	I had no idea, granted I've only seen his M
2015-11-09 22:47:49	AlexJ44	" legendary German director Fritz Lang’s tale of hate, murder, and revenge on the frontier, which starred Marlene Dietrich in a performance many will recognize from the parody of it in Blazing Saddles."
2015-11-09 22:47:58	indeedwatson	i was gonna watch a Lynch one on that theater but i couldn't stand the streaming quality :( i have to download them in advance
2015-11-09 22:48:20	AlexJ44	they put a lot of effort onto the theater, though
2015-11-09 22:48:31	BRCinephile	Speaking of Lynch, why did he postpone Twin Peaks again? :(
2015-11-09 22:48:46	indeedwatson	he did?
2015-11-09 22:48:47	AlexJ44	although, to me, it seems kinda counter-intuitive to watch a film and chat at the same time. it's probably best for rewatches, so you can comment and maybe pick up on stuff you hadn't noticed before
2015-11-09 22:48:57	indeedwatson	maybe he knew i was rewatching it and he wanted to give me more time 
2015-11-09 22:49:34	BRCinephile	yes
2015-11-09 22:49:40	BRCinephile	it will be in 2017 now

2015-11-09 22:51:54	Dema	Brilliant?
2015-11-09 22:51:55	BRCinephile	me neither, and I think that watching it for the first time nowadays wouldn't work, at least for me
2015-11-09 22:52:08	BRCinephile	watched some episodes, felt really dated
2015-11-09 22:53:24	indeedwatson	no, hank moody is fox mulder hiding from aliens

2015-11-09 23:18:50	Dema	My best friend explained that apparently part of it was filmed as a television pilot or something and then it was all turned into a movie.
2015-11-09 23:19:13	Card74	This is common knowledge
2015-11-09 23:19:23	Dema	So all I thought was, "well this certainly feels fragmented."
2015-11-09 23:19:34	Dema	Which is the point

2015-11-09 23:19:52	Dema	But idk there was just something nagging me. Maybe it made me a little uncomfortable.
2015-11-09 23:19:59	BRCinephile	hey, speaking of rewatching, do you guys rewatch movies more than you watch new ones?
2015-11-09 23:20:40	Dema	Yeah
2015-11-09 23:20:43	Dema	Not on purpose
2015-11-09 23:20:51	Dema	Just cause they're on Film 4
2015-11-09 23:21:19	Card74	Hmm. Probably. I love to show my movies to friends, so that explains part of the multiple viewings
2015-11-09 23:21:31	Dema	Me too
2015-11-09 23:21:51	BRCinephile	I see
2015-11-09 23:21:57	BRCinephile	good, makes me feel a little less crazy
2015-11-09 23:22:03	Dema	What ever happened to Ashley Judd?
2015-11-09 23:22:16	Dema	Did she have a rough couple years?
2015-11-09 23:22:17	BRCinephile	i think that 80% of what I watch is actually a rewatch
2015-11-09 23:23:40	Card74	OTOH I have been rather selective with my small collection; there aren't that many blind or impulse buys

2015-11-09 23:31:34	Raxivace	'Sup y'all
2015-11-09 23:31:44	indeedwatson	hi Raxivace 
2015-11-09 23:31:51	RyanSmallwood	hello
2015-11-09 23:31:53	BRCinephile	hello Raxivace
2015-11-09 23:32:06	indeedwatson	RyanSmallwood: yeah i do the same but that's like twice a month or less
2015-11-09 23:33:04	ravenous	So did you guys already talk about that Mulholland Dr. thread?
2015-11-09 23:33:31	Raxivace	Oh god that thread
2015-11-09 23:33:34	BRCinephile	I just read it
2015-11-09 23:33:47	BRCinephile	actually I never posted anything
2015-11-09 23:34:04	ravenous	It seemed like there were quite a few people that didn't fully understand the movie...
2015-11-09 23:34:30	BRCinephile	Well, it is a very subjective film
2015-11-09 23:34:39	indeedwatson	i replied to one guy who got downvoted
2015-11-09 23:34:43	BRCinephile	A full understanding may never be achieved
2015-11-09 23:35:10	RyanSmallwood	I'm woefully behind on David Lynch viewing so I haven't seen MD yet
2015-11-09 23:35:22	ravenous	I agree, but that just makes me love it more to be honest
2015-11-09 23:35:28	Raxivace	Lynch was one of the first directors I really got into
2015-11-09 23:35:49	ravenous	it just seemed like there were a few people in the thread ready to bash it (because they didn't understand the significance of certain scenes)
2015-11-09 23:36:11	indeedwatson	i haven't seen a Straight Story, is it worth it if I like crazy lynch?
2015-11-09 23:36:11	BRCinephile	Me too, and I think that there are a few movies that grow in you when you're watching it in the right mood
2015-11-09 23:36:23	Raxivace	Straight Story isn't crazy Lynch
2015-11-09 23:36:32	BRCinephile	indeed, but it is worth
2015-11-09 23:36:34	Raxivace	As the name implies, it is a straight forward story
2015-11-09 23:36:38	Raxivace	But it is good
2015-11-09 23:36:52	ravenous	lol
2015-11-09 23:37:25	Raxivace	Only movie of his to get a G rating too lmao
2015-11-09 23:37:41	BRCinephile	I remember when I watched La Mujer Sin Cabeza from Lucrecia Martel...didn't like that much
2015-11-09 23:37:46	RyanSmallwood	I know it's not a great film, but I have a huge fondness for Dune
2015-11-09 23:37:56	BRCinephile	Then I watched it again when I was passing through a situation like the main character
2015-11-09 23:38:06	ravenous	Were you into the novel? Or did you watch the movie solely?
2015-11-09 23:38:06	Raxivace	Dune has good qualities
2015-11-09 23:38:10	BRCinephile	and then I found the movie wass full perfection
2015-11-09 23:38:27	Raxivace	I like the atmosphere, the general set design etc.
2015-11-09 23:38:28	BRCinephile	I don't have the guts to watch Dune
2015-11-09 23:38:39	BRCinephile	even less after I watched Jodorowsky's Dune
2015-11-09 23:38:47	indeedwatson	Raxivace: i might watch Dune for the lulz, because i adore the book
2015-11-09 23:39:04	Raxivace	It's not terrible, though I haven't read the book fwiw
2015-11-09 23:39:08	RyanSmallwood	It's worth looking for some of the Dune fan edits
2015-11-09 23:39:15	indeedwatson	BRCinephile: we were talking with spooky the other day about what would've happened if Dune got made instead of Star Wars
2015-11-09 23:39:19	RyanSmallwood	both of the commcercial edits are compromised in different ways
2015-11-09 23:39:30	Raxivace	Patrick Stewart of all people is in the movie too. Crazy to think he worked with Lynch, albeit in a minor role
2015-11-09 23:40:34	BRCinephile	indeedwatson: that must have been a nice discussion
2015-11-09 23:40:49	BRCinephile	indeedwatson: could be a landmark in cinema
2015-11-09 23:41:32	Raxivace	Hey guys Rancho Notorious is actually playing now
2015-11-09 23:41:50	ravenous	Can I ask what you guys thought about the blue box in Mulholland Dr?
2015-11-09 23:42:18	Raxivace	IMO it is a box but also blue
2015-11-09 23:42:22	BRCinephile	I don't remember very well...I think it represented her guilt or something like that
2015-11-09 23:42:34	Dema	I can't recall
2015-11-09 23:42:43	Dema	I wasn't taken by the film though
2015-11-09 23:43:14	ravenous	Well, I guess it's a discussion best had after a recent viewing
2015-11-09 23:43:20	BRCinephile	for sure
2015-11-09 23:43:26	Raxivace	It's been a while since I've last seen the movie
2015-11-09 23:43:27	Dema	Yeah, I should probably watch it again.
2015-11-09 23:43:27	ravenous	That thread today got me all excited about the movie again though lol
2015-11-09 23:43:36	Raxivace	I have the new Criterion blu though
2015-11-09 23:43:40	BRCinephile	what I remember is that the diner scene was one of the scarier moments I had with cinema
2015-11-09 23:43:50	ravenous	Yes.
2015-11-09 23:44:04	indeedwatson	BRCinephile: more than THAT face in Inland Empire (you know what i'm talking about right?)
2015-11-09 23:44:09	Card74	Yeah
2015-11-09 23:44:13	Raxivace	OH JESUS THAT FACE IN IE
2015-11-09 23:44:19	ravenous	I swear I used to have nightmares about that guy as a kid, before even seeing the movie
2015-11-09 23:44:22	BRCinephile	indeedwatson: lol the face too
2015-11-09 23:44:22	Raxivace	Why did you have to remind me it exists
2015-11-09 23:44:29	BRCinephile	but IE is all bizarre
2015-11-09 23:44:37	Raxivace	INLAND EMPIRE is like
2015-11-09 23:44:38	indeedwatson	im so sorry
2015-11-09 23:44:40	ravenous	If you watch it on repeat, it gets to be comical
2015-11-09 23:44:41	BRCinephile	the rabbits scared me as well, and when she entered the set
2015-11-09 23:44:42	BRCinephile	omg
2015-11-09 23:44:51	Raxivace	You remember those videos of fake car commericals with jumpscares
2015-11-09 23:44:54	BRCinephile	That's something I love about Lynch...i dont like IE that much
2015-11-09 23:44:59	Raxivace	IE is a three hour version of that
2015-11-09 23:45:06	BRCinephile	but it does have a great mood and atmosphere
2015-11-09 23:45:15	indeedwatson	there's also that scene of the woman walking down a road at night coming toward the camera
2015-11-09 23:45:19	indeedwatson	that stuck with me too
2015-11-09 23:45:46	BRCinephile	indeedwatson: that scene is just after a giant clown face is on the screen
2015-11-09 23:45:49	BRCinephile	I remember it
2015-11-09 23:45:52	BRCinephile	scared me too lol
2015-11-09 23:45:58	Raxivace	In general IE is a movie I hated but I feel I'd like it more if I rewatched it...but I really don't want to because of how much I didn't like it and the runtime
2015-11-09 23:45:58	Dema	You guys make me feel like I really didn't take anything away from that movie haha
2015-11-09 23:46:09	BRCinephile	in fact, david lynch is one of the few things that scare me
2015-11-09 23:46:24	indeedwatson	his hair tho
2015-11-09 23:46:26	BRCinephile	The series finale of Twin Peaks gives me the creeps
2015-11-09 23:46:44	Card74	I first saw IE after having slept like 2 hours during the previous night. I kept nodding off at times, and the viewing was even more surreal than subsequent viewings.
2015-11-09 23:46:57	BRCinephile	lol
2015-11-09 23:46:57	Card74	would recommend :p
2015-11-09 23:46:58	indeedwatson	Card74: i had a similar experience
2015-11-09 23:47:14	Raxivace	Love the Twin Peaks finale
2015-11-09 23:47:17	indeedwatson	i never saw any lynch while being high, that'd be interesting
2015-11-09 23:47:26	Raxivace	And FWWM. Can't wait for the new season
2015-11-09 23:47:36	ravenous	I watched The Grand Budapest Hotel while on mushrooms
2015-11-09 23:47:43	ravenous	I cried for like an hour afterwards haha
2015-11-09 23:47:43	Card74	haha
2015-11-09 23:47:50	Dema	Lol
2015-11-09 23:48:07	Dema	It's rather beautiful
2015-11-09 23:48:15	BRCinephile	hahahaha
2015-11-09 23:48:31	BRCinephile	speaking of which
2015-11-09 23:48:40	Raxivace	The shot at the end of the GBH of the girl turning the page in the book always stuck with me
2015-11-09 23:49:00	BRCinephile	I really like the "new" Wes Anderson (from Moonrise Kingdom and GBH)
2015-11-09 23:49:13	BRCinephile	I couldn't stand the "old" one
2015-11-09 23:49:20	ravenous	Darjeeling limited was pretty
2015-11-09 23:49:21	BRCinephile	too much beauty, too little substance
2015-11-09 23:49:23	Dema	Really?
2015-11-09 23:49:24	indeedwatson	i saw that in theaters and i can't remember much of that movie, everyone says it's like his best movie but i didn't feel it
2015-11-09 23:49:38	Dema	DL? His best?
2015-11-09 23:49:41	indeedwatson	i really liked MK and rushmore
2015-11-09 23:49:47	indeedwatson	no, GBH
2015-11-09 23:49:50	Raxivace	Hotel Chevalier is cool
2015-11-09 23:49:52	RyanSmallwood	I like old Wes too, but I agree I think his new stuff is an improvement for me
2015-11-09 23:49:55	Dema	Ah ok.
2015-11-09 23:50:02	Raxivace	Wes Anderson in general seems to work best with hotels
2015-11-09 23:50:19	ravenous	If Wes Anderson remade the shining
2015-11-09 23:50:31	Dema	GBH is awesome in that it's a memoir of a true story
2015-11-09 23:50:41	Dema	"True"
2015-11-09 23:50:51	Dema	It's a story within a story
2015-11-09 23:51:24	Dema	I was always a bit partial to MK but I think I've become more critical in the ensuing years.
2015-11-09 23:51:32	BRCinephile	GBH to me was easily on a top 10 of 2014
2015-11-09 23:51:38	Dema	Agreed
2015-11-09 23:52:05	indeedwatson	how about sizou or whatever it was spelled
2015-11-09 23:52:24	Dema	Zissou?
2015-11-09 23:52:28	ravenous	depressing imo
2015-11-09 23:52:30	indeedwatson	yeah
2015-11-09 23:52:32	RyanSmallwood	I haven't seen it in quite a while, but I remember liking it a lot
2015-11-09 23:52:33	Dema	I think that's his funniest
2015-11-09 23:53:01	Dema	He does wry really well
2015-11-09 23:54:33	BRCinephile	before MK, the only movie from that I liked was Fantastic Mr. Fox
2015-11-09 23:54:50	Dema	Really?
2015-11-09 23:55:07	Dema	I really liked Tenenbaums
2015-11-09 23:55:43	Dema	I really didn't enjoy Rushmore though
2015-11-09 23:55:43	BRCinephile	I didn't :(
2015-11-09 23:56:00	Dema	I found the characters irritating.
2015-11-09 23:56:42	BRCinephile	this is exactly my problem with him
2015-11-09 23:56:54	BRCinephile	in almost all of his movies, his characters are the same
2015-11-09 23:57:02	BRCinephile	which changed a little in the last ones
2015-11-09 23:59:02	Dema	I see what you mean. Although I wouldn't fully agree.
2015-11-09 23:59:14	ravenous	To talk about another Anderson, did you guys see Inherent Vice?
2015-11-10 00:00:10	RyanSmallwood	I still need to see it
2015-11-10 00:00:25	BRCinephile	I didn't, and I'm already afraid
2015-11-10 00:00:34	BRCinephile	The Master was a big letdown for me
2015-11-10 00:00:49	Raxivace	I saw Inherent Vice
2015-11-10 00:00:51	RyanSmallwood	I loved The Master
2015-11-10 00:00:54	Raxivace	Can't recommend it
2015-11-10 00:01:00	ravenous	I read the book first and loved the film
2015-11-10 00:01:12	ravenous	my friends complained that it relied too heavily on the source material though
2015-11-10 00:01:26	indeedwatson	ravenous: literally watching right now
2015-11-10 00:01:30	ravenous	!!
2015-11-10 00:01:32	indeedwatson	about to finish it
2015-11-10 00:01:37	ravenous	The voice overs....
2015-11-10 00:01:41	ravenous	do you like it or?
2015-11-10 00:02:03	indeedwatson	im loving it, it made me laugh a lot at some points
2015-11-10 00:02:51	ravenous	there are definitely a few hilarious scenes, but overall the movie is pretty dark
2015-11-10 00:03:03	ravenous	beautiful neo-noir imo
2015-11-10 00:03:10	BRCinephile	is time for me to go
2015-11-10 00:03:13	BRCinephile	bye!
2015-11-10 00:03:23	RyanSmallwood	cya
2015-11-10 00:03:36	indeedwatson	i haven't read the book tho im interested in the author
2015-11-10 00:03:59	indeedwatson	ravenous: im pretty much watching it like a comedy

2015-11-10 00:04:48	ravenous	Pynchon is pretty hit or miss for a lot of people. His books are super dense and his dialogue is super relaxed in Inherent Vice
2015-11-10 00:05:07	ravenous	I had to reread sections over and over just to understand what the characters were really saying to each other
2015-11-10 00:05:25	tomflint	I loved the Master --- but mostly because I've studied cults with a focus on Scientology and The Family International (the cult that the Phoenix brothers were raised in)
2015-11-10 00:05:33	indeedwatson	i've had that happen with cormac mccarthy
2015-11-10 00:05:43	ravenous	There is a cult in Inherent Vice haha

2015-11-10 00:06:56	muskrat	indeedwatson, you were right. martyrs was definitely more fucked up than inside
2015-11-10 00:07:10	indeedwatson	i read blood meridian and it took me 3 tries to get into it, but it turned out to be probably my favorite contemporary book

2015-11-10 00:11:52	ravenous	It was really creepy, but the scene on the stairs ruined it for me

2015-11-10 00:15:55	ravenous	Yeah, exploitation was never my thing
2015-11-10 00:16:06	ravenous	I watched quite a few movies when I first discovered it
2015-11-10 00:16:21	chasingstatues	Dogtooth was fucked up
2015-11-10 00:16:24	ravenous	but after a while, you realize a great majority of it is senseless
2015-11-10 00:16:28	chasingstatues	And very good, I thought
2015-11-10 00:16:30	ravenous	I really liked Dogtooth
2015-11-10 00:16:45	ravenous	If anyone can really say that in polite company
2015-11-10 00:16:55	chasingstatues	Lol
2015-11-10 00:17:08	muskrat	that greek movie, right?
2015-11-10 00:17:11	chasingstatues	Yeah
2015-11-10 00:17:23	ravenous	I hated how it ended though
2015-11-10 00:17:32	ravenous	how long do you think she stayed locked in that trunk?
2015-11-10 00:17:34	chasingstatues	I was okay with the ambiguity
2015-11-10 00:17:34	RyanSmallwood	I prefer to stick with the more fun fucked up horror movies like Tetsuo: The Iron Man
2015-11-10 00:18:15	ravenous	Ichi the Killer: fun fucked up, or just plain fucked up?
2015-11-10 00:18:24	RyanSmallwood	Ichi the Killer is super fun
2015-11-10 00:18:37	chasingstatues	My favorite ghost movie is The Eclipse (not twilight related), it's got some terrifying scenes but it's mostly just this beautiful story about a man
2015-11-10 00:18:49	ravenous	chasing: what year?
2015-11-10 00:19:03	chasingstatues	I'm not sure off the top of my head, I can look it up
2015-11-10 00:19:21	ravenous	2009?
2015-11-10 00:19:27	chasingstatues	Yeah
2015-11-10 00:19:30	chasingstatues	It's a sad movie
2015-11-10 00:19:41	indeedwatson	i gotta go sleep
2015-11-10 00:19:44	ravenous	I saw part of this because my mom was watching it

2015-11-10 21:39:57	AlexJ44	i played a bit of resident evil 4 on the game cube emulator
2015-11-10 21:40:05	AlexJ44	but it bugs me that I can't adjust the controllers sensitivity
2015-11-10 21:40:23	AlexJ44	and BRCinephile , have you seen the documentary king of kong and ecstasy of order?
2015-11-10 21:40:36	indeedwatson	AlexJ44: why emulator
2015-11-10 21:40:49	indeedwatson	there's a steam version of RE4
2015-11-10 21:41:01	AlexJ44	i was just trying i tout

2015-11-10 21:41:09	indeedwatson	ah
2015-11-10 21:42:22	indeedwatson	what sensitivity do you mean
2015-11-10 21:42:25	AlexJ44	the analogs
2015-11-10 21:42:34	AlexJ44	the movement in RE4 is so clunky
2015-11-10 21:42:42	AlexJ44	but that might be the game itself
2015-11-10 21:42:45	AlexJ44	you must stop to shot and aim
2015-11-10 21:42:53	indeedwatson	not really
2015-11-10 21:42:59	indeedwatson	have you ever played RE1 to 3?
2015-11-10 21:43:25	AlexJ44	nope
2015-11-10 21:43:34	AlexJ44	never played any, I believe
2015-11-10 21:43:37	AlexJ44	a friend of mine is crazy about these games though
2015-11-10 21:43:38	indeedwatson	ever heard of tank controls?
2015-11-10 21:43:41	AlexJ44	and I played with him once
2015-11-10 21:43:45	AlexJ44	nope. what's that?
2015-11-10 21:44:15	indeedwatson	i could describe it but it's best if you experience it :p
2015-11-10 21:44:44	AlexJ44	let me google it
2015-11-10 21:45:04	AlexJ44	"Tank controls refers to a movement style in third person games where the character, not the camera, is used as the point of reference when choosing which control moves them in a given direction." yeah, definitely

2015-11-10 21:45:08	AlexJ44	and it's counter intuitive as well
2015-11-10 21:45:32	indeedwatson	that doesn't encompass it all
2015-11-10 21:45:35	AlexJ44	"Because the characters in such games don't move like human beings (agile), but tanks (slow and awkward)." this?
2015-11-10 21:45:36	AlexJ44	lol

2015-11-10 21:46:10	tomflint	I think Bruce Campbell should do a Mitt Romney-based action movie

2015-11-10 21:46:28	AlexJ44	but maybe later
2015-11-10 21:46:34	AlexJ44	i wasn't much impressed by the controls though

2015-11-10 21:47:34	indeedwatson	you can run around them
2015-11-10 21:47:58	indeedwatson	re4 is an action game basically
2015-11-10 21:48:05	indeedwatson	the ones before are survival horror

2015-11-10 21:48:52	AlexJ44	is the documentary worth it?
2015-11-10 21:49:48	indeedwatson	i watched it on a whim cause i was curious and it's pretty entertaining
2015-11-10 21:49:55	indeedwatson	saw it in 2 nights, pretty late

2015-11-10 22:08:36	AlexJ444	He says that he couldn't be influenced by Bergman, because he is a genius and woody isn't
2015-11-10 22:09:04	AlexJ444	And they would talk on  the phone for hours, but wouldn't meet because woody didn't like plane trips and didn't feel like having yogurt for lunch or something lol

2015-11-10 22:35:54	indeedwatson	i answered 1!
2015-11-10 22:36:06	@Carson	what was it?
2015-11-10 22:36:11	indeedwatson	Dune
2015-11-10 22:36:22	@Carson	oh yeah
2015-11-10 22:36:23	@Carson	why?
2015-11-10 22:37:21	@Carson	also what are you watching tonight, still on cyber punk stuff?
2015-11-10 22:37:24	indeedwatson	it's probably the most important work of sci fi
2015-11-10 22:38:33	indeedwatson	and it has so much stuff from so many different angles, the guy created societies and cultures so well, and how social changes took place, how technology arised from these imagined landscapes and necessities, as well as the inner world and personal philosophy of its characters
2015-11-10 22:39:08	indeedwatson	im just watching an ep of story of film, i have to go to bed in a bit cause i work tomorrow again :/
2015-11-10 22:41:28	indeedwatson	maybe hamlet and brothers karamazov
2015-11-10 22:41:43	indeedwatson	and if it's not cheating cause it's a comic, watchmen
2015-11-10 22:41:55	indeedwatson	i'll think the 5th one tomorrow :p
2015-11-10 22:41:59	indeedwatson	how about yours?

2015-11-10 22:49:50	indeedwatson	My great adventure is really Proust. Well—what remains to be written after that? I’m only in the first volume, and there are, I suppose, faults to be found, but I am in a state of amazement; as if a miracle were being done before my eyes. How, at last, has someone solidified what has always escaped—and made it too into this beautiful and perfectly enduring substance? One has to put the book down and
2015-11-10 22:49:50	indeedwatson	gasp. The pleasure becomes physical—like sun and wine and grapes and perfect serenity and intense vitality combined.

2015-11-10 22:51:20	ravenous	to the best of my ability
2015-11-10 22:51:29	ravenous	its been a couple of months since I've seen it last
2015-11-10 22:51:32	@Carson	raven, we were briefly talking about books
2015-11-10 22:51:39	@Carson	what about Vice?
2015-11-10 22:51:47	indeedwatson	i don't have much to say and it's not spoilery
2015-11-10 22:52:03	ravenous	well, I'm ready for it haha
2015-11-10 22:52:04	indeedwatson	but while i highly enjoyed it, i wonder how much was simply the performances and the writing
2015-11-10 22:52:41	ravenous	yeah, visually I was a little disappointed with the film
2015-11-10 22:53:14	indeedwatson	a lot of the dialogue seemed lifted from the book
2015-11-10 22:53:15	ravenous	especially since pynchon gave him so much to work on, and even if he didn't the era could've been played up more imo
2015-11-10 22:53:22	ravenous	it definitely was
2015-11-10 22:53:44	indeedwatson	and most of the times i laughed was because of joaquin phoenix
2015-11-10 22:53:55	indeedwatson	he was so good 
2015-11-10 22:54:39	ravenous	he was great for the part -- he did a really amazing job with her as well
2015-11-10 22:55:09	ravenous	are there any scenes that you particularly enjoyed?
2015-11-10 22:55:25	indeedwatson	the pancakes scene
2015-11-10 22:55:36	indeedwatson	even tho for some reason i dislike josh brolin's face
2015-11-10 22:56:03	indeedwatson	what i liked least was something towards the end but that gets kinda spoilery
2015-11-10 22:56:32	ravenous	so I'll never get to know then?
2015-11-10 22:56:53	ravenous	my favorite scene was the one with reese witherspoon
2015-11-10 22:57:05	@Carson	you can say it without being super specific
2015-11-10 22:57:19	indeedwatson	we could do what someone else said and make a channel to talk about it
2015-11-10 22:57:48	@Carson	eh I wouldn't worry that much about it
2015-11-10 22:57:48	indeedwatson	ravenous: there were a few of those
2015-11-10 22:57:56	@Carson	as long as your aren't announcing big reveals
2015-11-10 22:58:09	ravenous	yeah -- the longest one, where she's at his house haha
2015-11-10 22:58:27	indeedwatson	well, it felt kind of weird towards then end when it started feeling like it was gonna resolve everything happily
2015-11-10 22:58:35	ravenous	hahaha
2015-11-10 22:58:44	ravenous	i love how it ended
2015-11-10 22:58:50	@Carson	like with the Owen Wilson returning home scene?
2015-11-10 22:58:59	indeedwatson	like because of how the movie was up until that point, to suddenly have everything tied with a bow tie
2015-11-10 22:59:03	@Carson	the sun was setting and happier music was playing
2015-11-10 22:59:04	indeedwatson	yeah that and the boat
2015-11-10 22:59:22	indeedwatson	but then the last scene, wth was with that light
2015-11-10 22:59:33	ravenous	well he was driving into the mist
2015-11-10 22:59:41	ravenous	the mystery of the future, right
2015-11-10 22:59:43	@Carson	and then the last scene got really erie and tight
2015-11-10 22:59:53	indeedwatson	he was driving?
2015-11-10 22:59:59	indeedwatson	i thoought they were stationary
2015-11-10 23:00:00	@Carson	yeah
2015-11-10 23:00:03	indeedwatson	hang on im gonna check
2015-11-10 23:00:04	@Carson	hmm
2015-11-10 23:00:10	ravenous	maybe I'm thinking the book .__.
2015-11-10 23:00:11	@Carson	I thought he was driving as well
2015-11-10 23:00:21	@Carson	I imagine it was fake driving
2015-11-10 23:00:27	@Carson	the light of his face was so odd
2015-11-10 23:00:31	ravenous	i remember the dialogue from the book and he was driving at the end lol
2015-11-10 23:00:37	@Carson	borderline surreal

2015-11-10 23:01:22	ravenous	at least it wasn't a Chinatown ending
2015-11-10 23:01:51	indeedwatson	the only indication that they're driving is that the car moves VERY slightly
2015-11-10 23:01:58	indeedwatson	they even look like they're on the back seat
2015-11-10 23:02:09	indeedwatson	and the outside is a complete misty blur
2015-11-10 23:02:48	ravenous	damn, well I guess I was thinking about the book
2015-11-10 23:03:10	@Carson	wow
2015-11-10 23:03:16	ravenous	I feel really bad because when I first saw this movie I was PUMPED to talk about it with someone, and now i've forgotten a lot :/
2015-11-10 23:03:20	@Carson	yeah didn't see that either
2015-11-10 23:03:48	indeedwatson	he just looks at the light and smirks and says huh and it ends
2015-11-10 23:04:43	indeedwatson	ohh the scene where bigfoot stomps down his door was great too

2015-11-10 23:10:44	ravenous	Doc got on the Santa Monica Freeway, and about the time he was making the transition to the San Diego southbound, the fog began its nightly roll inland. He pushed his hair off his face, turned up the radio volume, lit a Kool, sank back in a cruising slouch, and watched everything slowly disappear, the trees and shrubbery along the median, the yello

2015-11-10 23:12:35	indeedwatson	oh but he was alone in the book
2015-11-10 23:12:48	ravenous	yeah
2015-11-10 23:13:08	ravenous	its funny that I remember the book better than the movie, especially since I read it first
2015-11-10 23:13:12	ravenous	even longer ago than seeing the film
2015-11-10 23:13:32	indeedwatson	i had the same happen with LotR

2015-11-10 23:14:52	ravenous	Honestly, I think she was a spy or something
2015-11-10 23:14:52	indeedwatson	im not sure
2015-11-10 23:14:52	@Carson	Joanna Newsons character in IV?
2015-11-10 23:15:39	@Carson	well it almost seems like she isn't there
2015-11-10 23:15:55	@Carson	she doesn't really directly interact with any characters besides Doc
2015-11-10 23:16:36	indeedwatson	why does she narrate tho?
2015-11-10 23:16:54	@Carson	I always had the thought that she may be a spirit or illusion
2015-11-10 23:16:59	@Carson	that's a bit crack potty though
2015-11-10 23:17:07	ravenous	She is the narrator? I thought it was another lady lol
2015-11-10 23:17:34	ravenous	which, I really didn't care for the narration -- a lot of the passages were just read wrong
2015-11-10 23:17:46	ravenous	weird emphasis mainly, but thats imo
2015-11-10 23:17:51	@Carson	no
2015-11-10 23:18:09	indeedwatson	oh i thought it was her narrating
2015-11-10 23:18:39	@Carson	it is sorry, no to raven, Sort is narrator
2015-11-10 23:18:46	@Carson	I just looked this up on Wiki By February 2011, Anderson had written a first draft and was more than halfway done with a second draft. The first draft was written without a narrator but the character of Sortilège was later turned into the voice of the narrator.
2015-11-10 23:19:21	@Carson	Sort really doesn't have much of a purpose besides narration?
2015-11-10 23:19:53	@Carson	and she seems to disappear in the car when they are going to that real estate trailer
2015-11-10 23:20:07	indeedwatson	oh yes i noticed that
2015-11-10 23:20:17	@Carson	was that just playful, or was it literal?
2015-11-10 23:20:20	indeedwatson	any good posts on r/truefilm about it?
2015-11-10 23:20:48	@Carson	I checked a few months ago, mostly stuff about figuring out the plot
2015-11-10 23:21:39	@Carson	you all know she is a musician and singer right? she has really weird lyrics though
2015-11-10 23:21:52	@Carson	she's also the wife of comedian Andy Sandberg
2015-11-10 23:21:53	ravenous	weird in what way?
2015-11-10 23:21:54	indeedwatson	is the basic plot that hard to follow for most people?
2015-11-10 23:22:04	indeedwatson	no, i don't think i ever saw her before
2015-11-10 23:22:15	@Carson	weird like you can't understand them, or it just sounds like nonsense words to most people
2015-11-10 23:22:26	@Carson	yeah I think the plot is hard to follow for most people
2015-11-10 23:22:32	chasingstatues	are you talking about Inherent Vice?
2015-11-10 23:22:41	@Carson	it's because you aren't clearly introduced to characters and names
2015-11-10 23:22:46	chasingstatues	i love her lyrics
2015-11-10 23:22:48	indeedwatson	maybe if i wasn't prepared beforehand?
2015-11-10 23:22:57	@Carson	and you can't connect the names with faces fast enough, too many characters
2015-11-10 23:23:18	indeedwatson	yes the constant influx of names was confusing, but i wouldn't call that the plot
2015-11-10 23:23:23	@Carson	chasing, I don't mind it, but it's just a general opinion I here
2015-11-10 23:23:25	indeedwatson	but i wonder why that was done
2015-11-10 23:23:28	chasingstatues	i just stopped caring about Newsom's narration and that made the movie more enjoyable
2015-11-10 23:23:29	@Carson	hear*
2015-11-10 23:23:56	ravenous	hahaha, agreed chasing
2015-11-10 23:23:59	indeedwatson	im guessing a normal director would've trimmed the characters down and even merged them
2015-11-10 23:24:05	@Carson	I didn't mind it
2015-11-10 23:24:21	chasingstatues	oh i agree they're weird Carson, lol, but they're really interesting, it makes me think of epic poetry
2015-11-10 23:24:33	indeedwatson	chasingstatues: yeah at times it felt like "say this bit of the good out loud, it sounds good"
2015-11-10 23:24:50	indeedwatson	of the book*
2015-11-10 23:24:54	indeedwatson	sry im sleepy
2015-11-10 23:25:01	chasingstatues	lol watson, i know what you mean
2015-11-10 23:25:18	chasingstatues	they just tried to tell too much of the important details of the story through her narration and it was overloaded
2015-11-10 23:28:14	@Carson	chasing do you know why she disappeared when Doc was going to the real estate trailer?
2015-11-10 23:29:47	chasingstatues	no, honestly i got like 2/3 of the way through and then had to go out so i never finished it
2015-11-10 23:29:58	chasingstatues	it's possible that happened during a part i was watching though and missed it lol
2015-11-10 23:31:22	indeedwatson	maybe ravenous can recall from the book
2015-11-10 23:32:45	chasingstatues	anyone ever read Haruki Murakami?
2015-11-10 23:32:53	chasingstatues	Inherent Vice reminded me a little bit of his books
2015-11-10 23:33:17	uguuuu	i've read haruki murakami ╰(°ㅂ°)╯
2015-11-10 23:33:18	indeedwatson	i cannot keep track of how many times i see murakami mentioned
2015-11-10 23:33:19	chasingstatues	just a little, but like in the way the main character just kind of meets all these crazy people and gets sucked into some situation that he doesn't fully understand
2015-11-10 23:33:28	chasingstatues	lol
2015-11-10 23:33:31	indeedwatson	i guess the universe wants me to read him
2015-11-10 23:33:35	chasingstatues	i'm taking a seminar course on him now at school
2015-11-10 23:34:24	indeedwatson	maybe murakami was influence by pynchon?
2015-11-10 23:35:46	chasingstatues	i've never read him
2015-11-10 23:36:23	chasingstatues	definitely by kafka and dostoyvesky and hesse
2015-11-10 23:36:47	chasingstatues	wait is that the author of inherent vice?
2015-11-10 23:37:50	indeedwatson	yes
2015-11-10 23:38:26	chasingstatues	ah okay
2015-11-10 23:38:32	ravenous	i'm sorry I was distracted by my rats
2015-11-10 23:38:58	chasingstatues	pet rats?
2015-11-10 23:39:04	indeedwatson	chasingstatues: uguuuu if you reach a consensus in 5 mins about which muramaki book is best to start with, i will download it before i go to bed
2015-11-10 23:39:07	indeedwatson	brb
2015-11-10 23:39:11	ravenous	yeah :3
2015-11-10 23:39:18	chasingstatues	nice
2015-11-10 23:39:23	ravenous	I've only read The Windup Bird by Murakami
2015-11-10 23:39:34	chasingstatues	Windup Bird was what i started with
2015-11-10 23:39:42	uguuuu	I started with that too
2015-11-10 23:39:54	chasingstatues	a wild sheep chase is my favorite
2015-11-10 23:39:58	chasingstatues	hands down
2015-11-10 23:40:11	ravenous	the descriptions of people being skinned x_x
2015-11-10 23:40:14	chasingstatues	"We can, if we so choose, wander aimlessly over the continent of the arbitrary"
2015-11-10 23:40:32	chasingstatues	oh yeah, that was brutal
2015-11-10 23:41:08	uguuuu	wild sheep chase or dance dance dance might be better to start with, wind-up bird is one of the longer ones
2015-11-10 23:41:19	ravenous	did you feel any sympathy for the main character? He more or less just wandered aloof the whole book -- I would've left him too
2015-11-10 23:41:20	chasingstatues	yeah, those two together are wonderful
2015-11-10 23:41:38	chasingstatues	his characters always seem kind of stoic
2015-11-10 23:42:10	chasingstatues	but they're also kind of devoid, like there's a great emptiness, sometimes he describes it well enough that you feel like the tragedy of their isolation
2015-11-10 23:42:16	chasingstatues	they're all very lonely, i think
2015-11-10 23:42:20	ravenous	alienated
2015-11-10 23:42:40	chasingstatues	yeah
2015-11-10 23:42:44	ravenous	I thought it was creepy how he connected with that young girl so much
2015-11-10 23:42:51	ravenous	talking to her while she was sunbathing
2015-11-10 23:42:53	chasingstatues	yeah, Murakami likes young girls
2015-11-10 23:42:58	ravenous	lol wth
2015-11-10 23:43:11	chasingstatues	but the relationships are always innocent, like i don't think they're necessarily meant to represent something sexual
2015-11-10 23:43:17	chasingstatues	maybe more like something youthful and hopeful
2015-11-10 23:44:02	indeedwatson	ok i'll download windup bird
2015-11-10 23:44:03	ravenous	Have you read any Kafka?
2015-11-10 23:44:20	indeedwatson	any translation in particular?
2015-11-10 23:44:49	chasingstatues	i haven't, but i'd like to
2015-11-10 23:44:56	chasingstatues	let me look at who translated my copy
2015-11-10 23:45:30	ravenous	Metamorphosis is pretty short
2015-11-10 23:45:40	indeedwatson	i need to start another "main" book since i finished neuromancer today
2015-11-10 23:45:42	ravenous	and arguably his most famous
2015-11-10 23:45:48	ravenous	next to The Trial
2015-11-10 23:46:23	chasingstatues	Alfred Birnbaum translated my copy of A Wild Sheep Chase
2015-11-10 23:46:25	ravenous	I've got Notes From the Underground waiting for me next
2015-11-10 23:46:46	ravenous	Notes From Underground* haha

2015-11-10 23:47:21	chasingstatues	this is her bf
2015-11-10 23:47:33	ravenous	what? lol
2015-11-10 23:47:39	chasingstatues	What makes you wanna read notes from underground? Have you read any other dostoyvesky?
2015-11-10 23:47:52	ravenous	I haven't! I'm really excited for it to be my first by him

2015-11-10 23:48:56	indeedwatson	i downloaded the first version i found of windup bird
2015-11-10 23:49:10	indeedwatson	chasingstatues: i read it entirely on my tiny phone screen
2015-11-10 23:49:15	indeedwatson	so that should answer it
2015-11-10 23:49:23	ravenous	damn

2015-11-10 23:50:36	indeedwatson	what genre is windup bird?
2015-11-10 23:50:44	chasingstatues	magical realism
2015-11-10 23:50:49	chasingstatues	is murakami's genre
2015-11-10 23:50:51	indeedwatson	cool
2015-11-10 23:51:14	chasingstatues	i think A Wild Sheep Chase might be more accessible if you don't find yourself into Windup
2015-11-10 23:51:22	@Carson	I have a bunch of his books downloaded, but haven't got around to it yet, I don't read books regularly :(

2015-11-11 21:34:20	@Carson	I would do additional research about these films
2015-11-11 21:34:50	@Carson	and then you should probably look for a more obscure list
2015-11-11 21:35:21	@Carson	High Noon is my favorite from that list
2015-11-11 21:35:29	indeedwatson	woah no TGTBATG in that? or once upon a time in the west?
2015-11-11 21:35:29	RyanSmallwood	Man of the West (Anthony Mann 1958), Rio Bravo (Howard Hawks 1959), Once Upon a Time in the West (Sergio Leone 1968), Red River (Howard Hawks 1948) , Johnny Guitar (Nicholas Ray 1954), My Darling Clementine (John Ford 1946), The Searchers (John Ford 1956), The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (Sergio Leone 1966), Winchester '73 (Anthony Mann 1950), The W

2015-11-11 21:35:52	@Carson	i wonder if it is excluded because Leone is Italian?

2015-11-11 23:30:16	keqin	yeah going by director sounds like a good idea - probably i need to identify what aspects of film i want to focus on learning

2015-11-11 23:31:16	Carson-PHONE	What do you mean by that indeed?

2015-11-12 10:37:46	Card74	It's a tool. I mostly use it to track what I've seen
2015-11-12 10:38:12	Sati1984	and to compare ratings with other users :-)
2015-11-12 10:38:17	Card74	The vote manipulation has gone out o hand
2015-11-12 10:38:26	indeedwatson	yeah i just like the letterboxd interface the most
2015-11-12 10:38:37	indeedwatson	black background with movie covers
2015-11-12 10:41:38	AlexJ44	i like imdb for the trivia section

2015-11-12 10:45:31	indeedwatson	i don't think so
2015-11-12 10:45:59	indeedwatson	oh yes, Halloween
2015-11-12 10:46:13	indeedwatson	i should watch Escape From New York

2015-11-12 10:48:06	Card74	I remember this on movie rating site... The grades had stars + description, and were mostly "I liked it", "I really liked it", "I loved it", "I really loved it", "It was awesome" etc
2015-11-12 10:48:26	Card74	and the scale was - get this - 1 to 13
2015-11-12 10:48:50	Card74	They just added more and more stars
2015-11-12 10:49:20	indeedwatson	heh
2015-11-12 10:49:30	Card74	Their recommendation algorithm was quite good, though
2015-11-12 10:51:01	indeedwatson	as good as criticker's?

2015-11-12 12:28:17	indeedwatson	hey Carson 
2015-11-12 12:46:45	@Carson	someone should make a film with only actors that have the same birthday
2015-11-12 12:46:53	@Carson	and release it on that birthday date
2015-11-12 13:01:21	indeedwatson	can you pass that joint Carson :^)
2015-11-12 13:01:32	@Carson	lol
2015-11-12 13:01:54	@Carson	Ryan Gosling and Anne Hathaway both have a birthday today
2015-11-12 13:07:19	kerozene	joel edgerton is a surprisingly good writer
2015-11-12 13:08:16	kerozene	especially if you've seen his earlier tv acting

2015-11-12 13:12:21	@Carson	he played opposite Christian Bale, in Ridley Scotts Exodus Gods and Kings
2015-11-12 13:12:51	@Carson	he also played the husband in the new Great Gatsby
2015-11-12 13:12:58	indeedwatson	haven't seen either
2015-11-12 13:13:08	@Carson	both awful
2015-11-12 13:13:21	@Carson	but his performance is normally good
2015-11-12 13:13:28	@Carson	he's really good in the film Warrior
2015-11-12 13:13:35	indeedwatson	but kerozene said writer
2015-11-12 13:14:30	@Carson	he wrote The Rover
2015-11-12 13:14:44	@Carson	and most recently starred in and wrote The Gift
2015-11-12 13:14:46	indeedwatson	is that any good?
2015-11-12 13:14:56	kerozene	I just watched the gift. it's not Great by any means but it ticks a lot of good boxes
2015-11-12 13:15:06	@Carson	The Rover, I haven't seen, but is probably better than most
2015-11-12 13:16:12	kerozene	the rover is stylistically nice, especially if you've spent time in australia
2015-11-12 13:16:28	kerozene	but it tries to hard to be grave and meaningful
2015-11-12 13:16:31	kerozene	too*
2015-11-12 13:17:07	kerozene	the soundtrack is amazing though
2015-11-12 13:17:28	kerozene	and he uses sound really well in the gift too
2015-11-12 13:17:37	kerozene	have to watch The Square soon

2015-11-12 13:27:55	indeedwatson	hey
2015-11-12 13:30:08	AlexJ44	i was thinking of watching something
2015-11-12 13:30:25	AlexJ44	maybe a james bond, as I've never see any
2015-11-12 13:30:39	indeedwatson	it's rainy here, perfect for watching something, but nothing's downloaded yet
2015-11-12 13:30:47	indeedwatson	i saw one of the old ones
2015-11-12 13:30:51	indeedwatson	from russia with love i think
2015-11-12 13:30:55	indeedwatson	wasn't a fan
2015-11-12 13:32:46	AlexJ44	it seems like these latest craig films have been good
2015-11-12 13:34:39	AlexJ44	i'm torn between a fassbinder
2015-11-12 13:34:45	AlexJ44	or maybe a kubrick
2015-11-12 13:35:55	indeedwatson	never seen fassbinder
2015-11-12 13:36:15	AlexJ44	i like watching 2 or 3 from a director's oeuvre
2015-11-12 13:36:23	AlexJ44	you can grasp a little better what they're trying to do in the major plan
2015-11-12 13:37:20	AlexJ44	by the way, have you ever seen a thomas altman?
2015-11-12 13:37:25	AlexJ44	robert* altman?
2015-11-12 13:37:34	indeedwatson	i don't think so

2015-11-12 17:46:08	indeedwatson	i have fresh yeast so i have to use it quick
2015-11-12 17:47:50	tomflint	the starters I've made don't have yeast added
2015-11-12 17:48:35	indeedwatson	yeah but that takes too long for me
2015-11-12 17:49:34	tomflint	check the measurements re: fresh yeast and all, but you should make a lot of dough.
2015-11-12 17:49:55	tomflint	I have to jet for a meeting --- but I'll be back in a few hours
2015-11-12 17:50:44	indeedwatson	i always make 1kg flour

2015-11-12 19:32:49	AlexJ44	you can upload stalker
2015-11-12 19:33:53	AlexJ44	that shia pic LOL
2015-11-12 19:44:48	indeedwatson	there's several stalker versions
2015-11-12 19:45:05	indeedwatson	just none that look very good, im guessing the BR isn't a proper remaster or something

2015-11-12 20:22:38	AlexJ44	i just finished nashville
2015-11-12 20:22:49	AlexJ44	i don't even know what to think of it
2015-11-12 20:22:50	@Carson	what did you think?
2015-11-12 20:22:52	@Carson	heh
2015-11-12 20:25:19	AlexJ44	it was weird
2015-11-12 20:25:22	AlexJ44	almost 3h too
2015-11-12 20:26:01	AlexJ44	halfway through it clicked that I was watching an altman
2015-11-12 20:27:03	AlexJ44	so I shouldn't be excepting much in the narrative department
2015-11-12 20:27:20	AlexJ44	but jesus, was shelley duvall annoying
2015-11-12 20:27:28	AlexJ44	her character, at least
2015-11-12 20:33:06	@Carson	yeah there is a lot of singing
2015-11-12 20:33:49	AlexJ44	yeah - a whole lot
2015-11-12 20:33:53	AlexJ44	but I feel there's more to it
2015-11-12 20:34:00	AlexJ44	the characters were diverse and some were very interesting
2015-11-12 20:34:54	AlexJ44	it's funny that people say it's the quintessential american film

2015-11-12 20:47:13	Card74	It's 1:45am, the movie night with friends went on longer than I suspected, and I still have a rental I need to watch...
2015-11-12 20:47:24	Card74	oh well ->
2015-11-12 20:48:19	AlexJ44	haha, movie nights with friends is always fun
2015-11-12 20:48:20	AlexJ44	what did you have to watch?
2015-11-12 20:48:34	indeedwatson	25min for stalker, lets hope it doesn't crash again
2015-11-12 20:48:44	TheHoopsProphet	my friends have shit taste in movies
2015-11-12 20:49:24	AlexJ44	good luck indeedwatson !
2015-11-12 20:49:36	AlexJ44	well so do mine, but some stuff is fun to watch with them
2015-11-12 20:50:35	indeedwatson	mine have decent taste i guess
2015-11-12 20:55:04	TheHoopsProphet	indeedwatson: are you torrenting Stalker?
2015-11-12 20:55:35	indeedwatson	AlexJ44 lent me his seedbox :)
2015-11-12 20:56:00	TheHoopsProphet	very nice
2015-11-12 20:58:36	Card74	I showed them Videodrome, they hadn't seen it before
2015-11-12 20:58:48	TheHoopsProphet	haha how did they like it?
2015-11-12 20:59:36	AlexJ44	I haven't seen any cronenberg
2015-11-12 21:00:03	Card74	They liked it. The ending had them a bit confused, but they had a good time
2015-11-12 21:00:31	TheHoopsProphet	AlexJ44: Eastern Promises is a good one, perhaps my favorite of his.
2015-11-12 21:00:44	AlexJ44	doesn't he work mostly with suspense et al?
2015-11-12 21:01:37	indeedwatson	i really wanna watch videodrome
2015-11-12 21:01:45	TheHoopsProphet	Some of his are suspensful, yeah.
2015-11-12 21:01:48	indeedwatson	Card74: would you consider it cyberpunk?
2015-11-12 21:02:26	AlexJ44	what would you consider cyberpunk?
2015-11-12 21:02:42	AlexJ44	that's a term I see people use a lot
2015-11-12 21:02:50	Card74	AlexJ44: definitely check out Videodrome when you have a chance.
2015-11-12 21:02:56	AlexJ44	I'll bookmark it
2015-11-12 21:03:05	AlexJ44	I have been watching stuff from all over the place, which isn't very good
2015-11-12 21:03:12	AlexJ44	sometimes you learn more by sticking to a genre, or specially, a director
2015-11-12 21:04:12	indeedwatson	dystopic future, marginalized characters
2015-11-12 21:04:19	indeedwatson	obviously technology
2015-11-12 21:04:23	Card74	indeed: hmm... more like surreal / body horror. But I can see why one would ask that.
2015-11-12 21:04:38	indeedwatson	maybe with some noir too
2015-11-12 21:05:20	AlexJ44	and the other day someone was discussing the dune novel, that interested me as well
2015-11-12 21:05:32	AlexJ44	what about cronenberg's the fly? have you seen it Card74 ?
2015-11-12 21:05:44	indeedwatson	AlexJ44: that was probably me
2015-11-12 21:06:01	Card74	Yeah, I love that version.
2015-11-12 21:06:03	AlexJ44	hehe I didn't want to point out names!
2015-11-12 21:07:34	indeedwatson	:)
2015-11-12 21:07:43	indeedwatson	you should read it asap
2015-11-12 21:09:22	Card74	I also happened to see the horrible The Fly 2 at an impressionable age, so I have slightly nostalgic feelings towards that. It's trash, and I can't really recommend it. But, you know... sometimes you get too nostalgic for your early horror movies :)
2015-11-12 21:09:24	AlexJ44	oh well, i'm reading kirkegaard at the moment
2015-11-12 21:09:44	AlexJ44	because woody allen said you bergman is very very influenced by kirkegaard
2015-11-12 21:09:49	AlexJ44	Card74 , I don't really like horror movies
2015-11-12 21:09:56	AlexJ44	but I'm making an effort to be more broad with my tastes
2015-11-12 21:11:05	Card74	Check out The Fly some day. It's well made, considering it was done in 1986.
2015-11-12 21:11:14	AlexJ44	is it inspired in the book?
2015-11-12 21:11:53	TheHoopsProphet	AlexJ44: what kind of movies do you usually watch?
2015-11-12 21:12:01	AlexJ44	I don't know...dramas?
2015-11-12 21:12:10	AlexJ44	http://letterboxd.com/aj44
2015-11-12 21:12:26	TheHoopsProphet	just curious, since you said you were broadening your tastes
2015-11-12 21:12:43	Card74	It's a remake of the 50s movie of the same name. And along with The Thing, one of the few remakes worth watching
2015-11-12 21:12:53	indeedwatson	wow i just realized i wasn't following you AlexJ44 
2015-11-12 21:13:11	AlexJ44	i've seen the original the thing yesterday!
2015-11-12 21:13:31	AlexJ44	TheHoopsProphet , i'm a bit new to film. have only been serious about watching films for like an year or so
2015-11-12 21:13:49	AlexJ44	so i'm still picking my ground, but have never had any particular interest in horror
2015-11-12 21:13:59	TheHoopsProphet	ah i see. im following you now though XD
2015-11-12 21:14:11	indeedwatson	AlexJ44: carpenter's is a remake i think
2015-11-12 21:14:23	AlexJ44	indeedwatson  and TheHoopsProphet , put your usernames here so I can follow you as well
2015-11-12 21:14:29	AlexJ44	is it? I thought it was the original
2015-11-12 21:14:30	TheHoopsProphet	im thewillmatic
2015-11-12 21:14:37	indeedwatson	http://letterboxd.com/spookyfox/
2015-11-12 21:14:49	AlexJ44	yes
2015-11-12 21:14:50	indeedwatson	im gonna delete those old reviews
2015-11-12 21:14:55	indeedwatson	they're embarrassing
2015-11-12 21:14:55	AlexJ44	it's a remake of a 1952 film
2015-11-12 21:15:54	AlexJ44	there you go, i'm now following you both
2015-11-12 21:15:55	Card74	Carpenter's is a new version. The 1952 and 82 films are based on a novel
2015-11-12 21:16:18	Card74	and Carpenter follows the story more faithfully
2015-11-12 21:16:19	AlexJ44	I haven't seen alien as well
2015-11-12 21:16:33	Card74	..!
2015-11-12 21:17:03	AlexJ44	i don't really enjoy body horror, but i'll have to make an effort to watch the fly
2015-11-12 21:17:09	Card74	Come ON. Buy the Alien Legacy set and watch the first two
2015-11-12 21:17:14	Card74	oh right
2015-11-12 21:17:19	indeedwatson	stalker 98%, 40min remaining, wtf
2015-11-12 21:17:45	indeedwatson	i listened to an Alien commentary that made me want to watch the 3rd one
2015-11-12 21:18:44	AlexJ44	i'm rooting for you indeedwatson
2015-11-12 21:18:49	AlexJ44	have you seen any tarkovsky?
2015-11-12 21:19:07	Card74	the correct versions to watch are:  Alien (theatrical), Aliens (theatrical for your first time, director's cut for subsequent viewings)
2015-11-12 21:19:46	Card74	I'd say avoid anything made after those two
2015-11-12 21:19:48	indeedwatson	me? i've seen everything except the sacrifice and nostalgia
2015-11-12 21:20:07	indeedwatson	i rarely see them discussed
2015-11-12 21:21:13	AlexJ44	oh really? do you like his style?
2015-11-12 21:21:33	indeedwatson	TheHoopsProphet: haha you have a list of movies you won't watch?
2015-11-12 21:21:42	TheHoopsProphet	yeah lol
2015-11-12 21:21:42	indeedwatson	AlexJ44: he's one of my favorite directors
2015-11-12 21:21:54	TheHoopsProphet	got bored one day. have you seen any of them?
2015-11-12 21:21:58	indeedwatson	kill bill seems out of place there :p
2015-11-12 21:22:00	indeedwatson	no
2015-11-12 21:22:05	AlexJ44	"movies i will probably never watch" lol
2015-11-12 21:22:19	AlexJ44	why not kill bill? too gory?
2015-11-12 21:22:24	AlexJ44	indeedwatson i've seen solaris...it was nice
2015-11-12 21:22:31	indeedwatson	TheHoopsProphet: it is also telling that you only listed pall blar mall cap TWO, implying you've seen the first ;)
2015-11-12 21:22:48	indeedwatson	AlexJ44: i might like solaris more than 2001, im not sure yet
2015-11-12 21:22:49	TheHoopsProphet	i want to see the first one lol
2015-11-12 21:22:59	indeedwatson	O:
2015-11-12 21:23:04	TheHoopsProphet	also kill bill 2 is a mistake
2015-11-12 21:23:07	AlexJ44	yes, I'm aware they are kind of opposites
2015-11-12 21:23:09	TheHoopsProphet	idk why that on there
2015-11-12 21:23:12	TheHoopsProphet	indeedwatson: we have a lot of movies in common. did you enjoy Caché and Memories of Murder?
2015-11-12 21:23:17	indeedwatson	yes
2015-11-12 21:23:36	indeedwatson	MoM is my favorite crime mystery movie
2015-11-12 21:23:50	TheHoopsProphet	yeah i thought it was great
2015-11-12 21:23:53	indeedwatson	made me dislike Zodiac
2015-11-12 21:23:59	AlexJ44	I'm listening to rubber soul for the first time
2015-11-12 21:24:12	AlexJ44	memories of murder? never seen it
2015-11-12 21:24:28	indeedwatson	i haven't seen any korean films in ages
2015-11-12 21:25:35	indeedwatson	1 minute!!!
2015-11-12 21:26:25	AlexJ44	Go stalker!
2015-11-12 21:26:39	AlexJ44	i think i've only seen one korean, and I'm not even sure what it was
2015-11-12 21:27:05	indeedwatson	i had a phase with korean cinema
2015-11-12 21:27:54	TheHoopsProphet	they’re pretty well made movies
2015-11-12 21:27:56	AlexJ44	too bad thundercat didn't show up again
2015-11-12 21:28:14	AlexJ44	because I just found my metamorphosis copy around the house, and it's prefaced by one of my favorite authors, vladimir nabokov
2015-11-12 21:28:40	indeedwatson	i only ever see lolita mentioned by him
2015-11-12 21:29:20	indeedwatson	sometimes in top novels of all time, lolita is at the top, but then in the following 20 there's 2 or 3 dostoievky novels
2015-11-12 21:30:01	AlexJ44	lolita is a curious case..
2015-11-12 21:30:08	AlexJ44	I'm very fond of that book
2015-11-12 21:30:19	AlexJ44	it's very powerful, so to say
2015-11-12 21:30:55	AlexJ44	but he was a very knowledgeable literary critic
2015-11-12 21:31:04	AlexJ44	he wrote a book full of essays on russian literature
2015-11-12 21:32:26	RyanSmallwood	yet another thread on The Assassin
2015-11-12 21:32:49	AlexJ44	oh, pmcinem posted his thread
2015-11-12 21:33:07	indeedwatson	nice
2015-11-12 21:33:14	indeedwatson	i get the feeling he won't come back, for some reason
2015-11-12 21:33:19	AlexJ44	and yes - another thread on the assassin. why is that so? I haven't seen the film and I wanted to understand all the fuss
2015-11-12 21:33:25	indeedwatson	AlexJ44: i was a bit disappointed with Lolita
2015-11-12 21:33:25	AlexJ44	it's likely he won't
2015-11-12 21:33:33	AlexJ44	but we should show up in the theater!
2015-11-12 21:33:36	indeedwatson	probably because it was so highly ranked
2015-11-12 21:33:38	AlexJ44	the book or the film?
2015-11-12 21:33:41	indeedwatson	book
2015-11-12 21:33:49	AlexJ44	and what language did you read it in?
2015-11-12 21:34:21	indeedwatson	english
2015-11-12 21:34:30	indeedwatson	talker complete!!
2015-11-12 21:34:37	indeedwatson	thanks again AlexJ44 
2015-11-12 21:34:43	indeedwatson	stalker*
2015-11-12 21:35:55	AlexJ44	and you didn't enjoy it?
2015-11-12 21:36:09	RyanSmallwood	There's critically lauded slow paced arthouse cinema every year, for some reason The Assassin seems to be reaching people who don't know what they're getting. Maybe because its also kind of an action film?
2015-11-12 21:36:15	AlexJ44	there's two dimensions to the book: the story and how it gets manipulated by its writing
2015-11-12 21:36:32	AlexJ44	it's because it's getting hyped a lot RyanSmallwood
2015-11-12 21:36:34	indeedwatson	i did, i said "a bit disappointed"
2015-11-12 21:36:34	AlexJ44	it's a cicle
2015-11-12 21:36:51	AlexJ44	kind of the same way Under The Skin got a lot of buzz and maybe a lot of people who didn't get it
2015-11-12 21:36:53	indeedwatson	yeah i know, he's a charmer and a great example of unreliable narrator
2015-11-12 21:36:54	AlexJ44	(myself included)
2015-11-12 21:37:07	indeedwatson	but i felt it dragged a bit in the middle
2015-11-12 21:37:19	AlexJ44	more than unreliable, he's manipulative
2015-11-12 21:37:22	AlexJ44	how old are you indeedwatson ?
2015-11-12 21:37:38	AlexJ44	im sorry, I feel I should know the answer by now
2015-11-12 21:38:07	indeedwatson	26
2015-11-12 21:38:31	AlexJ44	indeedwatson , pmcinern mentioned the IRC in his post!
2015-11-12 21:38:36	AlexJ44	so I suppose he's coming back after all
2015-11-12 21:38:42	indeedwatson	yay
2015-11-12 21:39:25	AlexJ44	as for lolita, I've read it last year and, to be honest, it was also a bit of a drag to me. because his english was, at some times, kinda of unintelligible
2015-11-12 21:39:41	indeedwatson	i had that problem too
2015-11-12 21:39:43	AlexJ44	but it's such a perverse, and dark book
2015-11-12 21:39:55	indeedwatson	but i also had it wth Blood Meridian, and i adore that book now
2015-11-12 21:40:05	AlexJ44	and yet it's narrated as if it was an inoccent fairy tale
2015-11-12 21:40:26	AlexJ44	and some of the wordplay was incredible
2015-11-12 21:40:52	indeedwatson	i love the 1st paragraph
2015-11-12 21:41:03	indeedwatson	probably my favorite bit of it :p
2015-11-12 21:42:52	RyanSmallwood	AlexJ44: I haven't been on TrueFilm for too too long, were there a lot of Under The Skin topics back when that was out?
2015-11-12 21:42:58	AlexJ44	"Conveniently, [a film] it’s now lost to the world. See, during the Japan occupation, they burned film stock for the silver nitrate.There are almost no surviving prewar Hong Kong movies as a result. Classy folks."
2015-11-12 21:42:59	AlexJ44	lol
2015-11-12 21:43:20	AlexJ44	@RyanSmallwood I think so. But don't take my word for it, as I have less intense periods of lurking the forums
2015-11-12 21:43:40	AlexJ44	https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/search?q=under+the+skin+&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all check for youself :p

2015-11-12 21:43:53	AlexJ44	maybe under the skin was a little more buzzed, but I think you get my point
2015-11-12 21:44:04	AlexJ44	indeedwatson I underlined a lot of passages. Some were really, really good
2015-11-12 21:44:11	AlexJ44	and I'm curious to see how kubrick handles the film
2015-11-12 21:44:44	indeedwatson	i think as per usual kubrick, very different from the source
2015-11-12 21:44:58	indeedwatson	but i watched it like... 10 years ago
2015-11-12 21:45:59	RyanSmallwood	hah, guess The Assassin just the hyped arthouse film of the season
2015-11-12 21:46:07	AlexJ44	have you seen it RyanSmallwood ? is it worth it?
2015-11-12 21:46:35	RyanSmallwood	I like it a lot, but I already like Hou Hsiao Hsien films
2015-11-12 21:46:40	RyanSmallwood	depends on if you like slow movies or not
2015-11-12 21:47:07	TheHoopsProphet	anyone seen the Three Colors (Red White Blue) trilogy?
2015-11-12 21:47:46	indeedwatson	only blue
2015-11-12 21:47:55	TheHoopsProphet	was it good?
2015-11-12 21:48:14	AlexJ44	indeedwatson , can you check KG for Buddha Palm (1964) ?
2015-11-12 21:48:34	AlexJ44	TheHoopsProphet , I fell asleep halfway through blue. but they're well regarded
2015-11-12 21:48:53	RyanSmallwood	Hah, I uploaded Buddha Palm to Karagarga
2015-11-12 21:48:57	AlexJ44	I don't know any of his work, RyanSmallwood, so I was kind of taken aback by all the success
2015-11-12 21:49:03	AlexJ44	Hmm
2015-11-12 21:49:06	AlexJ44	I can't find it on PTP
2015-11-12 21:49:17	indeedwatson	AlexJ44: 7gb, 1 seed
2015-11-12 21:49:24	AlexJ44	maybe I'm finally getting to the kind of films that won't show up on PTP
2015-11-12 21:49:28	RyanSmallwood	the first movie was only fan-subbed recently, no subs on KG
2015-11-12 21:49:38	AlexJ44	do you know where I could find it?
2015-11-12 21:49:43	AlexJ44	I wanted to view it prior to the theater

2015-11-12 21:51:50	indeedwatson	it is also in surrealmoviez
2015-11-12 21:52:39	AlexJ44	it says part 1. is it a full movie, but part 1 to a story arc?
2015-11-12 21:52:42	indeedwatson	do you want the links? it's 2 parts
2015-11-12 21:52:49	RyanSmallwood	Its Part 1 of 5
2015-11-12 21:52:53	RyanSmallwood	its the first movie

2015-11-12 22:30:41	Zaiso	i just got akira as well hoepfully i have time to fit that in
2015-11-12 22:30:51	spooky	whoa! i remember when city of god came out
2015-11-12 22:30:55	spooky	that movie was amazing

2015-11-12 22:31:50	Zaiso	and yea i've always been curious about brazilian films and heard some many good things about it
2015-11-12 22:32:06	indeedwatson	Blade Runner, Akira, THX 1138 (i guess not really cyberpunk), Brazil, Ghost in the Shell, Avalon
2015-11-12 22:32:12	indeedwatson	Zaiso: the manga is amazing
2015-11-12 22:32:37	indeedwatson	story and character wise, better than the movie i'd say, but the movie has the animation and the OST to make up for it
2015-11-12 22:32:40	spooky	brazil and thx-1138 are not cyberpunk

2015-11-12 22:34:40	indeedwatson	AI is cyberpunk?
2015-11-12 22:35:13	tomflint	I think their definition of cyberpunk is 'the world sucks... and its the future!'
2015-11-12 22:35:24	indeedwatson	automata was awful
2015-11-12 22:35:38	indeedwatson	doesn't help that i hate antonio banderas
2015-11-12 22:36:11	Zaiso	I see Dredd on the list
2015-11-12 22:36:12	indeedwatson	i forgot i watched it until now
2015-11-12 22:36:26	Zaiso	I really liked that film a lot though i feel like it will get forgotten in a couple years
2015-11-12 22:36:26	indeedwatson	i wouldn't call Dredd cyberpunk lol

2015-11-12 22:43:33	keqin	in ex machina i think that anthropromorphizing tech/bio industries into the genius oscar isaac isn't exactly plausible, but it gave us a nice little ecosystem to test our theories about AI
2015-11-12 22:43:39	Zaiso	tomflint i'm debating star wars or hateful 8 for first movie of christmas break
2015-11-12 22:43:49	keqin	just like how he has a little island to test for AI robots

2015-11-12 22:44:20	Zaiso	indeedwatson i thought cruise was very bearable in the film its very stylized as well . i liked the film a lot there's a lot more depth then just a tom cruise action movie
2015-11-12 22:44:23	tomflint	... so watch it second.
2015-11-12 22:44:49	tomflint	Minority Report was written to be Total Recall 2

2015-11-12 22:45:46	Zaiso	keqin hmm i always find the human representations interesting as if we can't let go being intelligent needs to look human

2015-11-12 22:46:40	indeedwatson	it was very shitty
2015-11-12 22:46:40	tomflint	The trouble with Star Wars is that its a disney thing -- so we have Lucas' desire for toys x 10

2015-11-12 22:57:29	keqin	we should consider why it would be a failure - for the case of akira, the story is tied to japanese mythology and their experiences in WW2 - if u remake it in America it's just not going to have the same effect
2015-11-12 22:57:48	Zaiso	haha that is true i suppose it's really hard for an adaptation in any sense because of how great akira is
2015-11-12 22:57:54	keqin	so if i were a producer remaking akira, id just take the plot and hope the fanbase would buy into it

2015-11-12 22:58:27	Pmcinern	I promise you, I'll catch on one of these days
2015-11-12 22:58:33	Zaiso	if akira was to be done right live action it would need a really great budget
2015-11-12 22:58:33	tomflint	:)
2015-11-12 22:58:43	indeedwatson	you can type the first letters of a name and press tab
2015-11-12 22:58:47	RyanSmallwood	hello
2015-11-12 22:58:52	RyanSmallwood	sorry I wasn't looking at the screen
2015-11-12 22:58:57	indeedwatson	Zaiso: it'd also be way too smart and surreal for normal audiences
2015-11-12 22:59:09	RyanSmallwood	I just posted in the wxuia thread
2015-11-12 22:59:15	RyanSmallwood	*wuxia
2015-11-12 22:59:38	indeedwatson	if there is one thing that could make akira better, is take the same people, give them a huge budget, and have them make a short series out of the manga
2015-11-12 22:59:47	tomflint	Did you guys like Sunset Blvd?
2015-11-12 23:00:29	Zaiso	i just watched all about eve so i'm going to get to sunset blvd soon
2015-11-12 23:00:29	Pmcinern	Oh nice
2015-11-12 23:01:09	tomflint	I don't know the history or impact of it, but its fantastic
2015-11-12 23:01:45	keqin	norma was creepy lol
2015-11-12 23:02:06	tomflint	good lord, yes!
2015-11-12 23:02:13	RyanSmallwood	Sunset Boulevard is fantastic
2015-11-12 23:02:18	tomflint	if it were modernized, she'd have a lot of plastic surgery ---
2015-11-12 23:03:12	tomflint	I put a dent in my movie spreadsheet -- only 1895 hours to go!
2015-11-12 23:03:24	Pmcinern	For anyone wanting to watch more Wilder after sunset, go with Five Graves to Cairo
2015-11-12 23:04:21	indeedwatson	should i watch stalker now? it'll mean going to bed at 2am

2015-11-12 23:33:58	tomflint	my favorite is a slightly dehydrated mushroom base, a good salami, toasted fennel, and a little ripped prosciutto ---
2015-11-12 23:34:12	tomflint	and some sun dried olives
2015-11-12 23:34:41	indeedwatson	never had fennel in pizza, not sure i'd enjoy it
2015-11-12 23:35:01	tomflint	fennel and salami is a match made in heaven
2015-11-12 23:35:11	tomflint	toasted fennel seed -- so good
2015-11-12 23:35:27	indeedwatson	hmm, never had it toasted
2015-11-12 23:35:34	tomflint	its the only way
2015-11-12 23:35:46	indeedwatson	i've had it in salad

2015-11-12 23:40:51	indeedwatson	it's a plant
2015-11-12 23:40:56	tomflint	I mean, you could use it fresh and top the pie with it once its baked
2015-11-12 23:40:57	indeedwatson	why cant you grow it there

2015-11-12 23:42:06	indeedwatson	i had a plant and it died 
2015-11-12 23:42:11	indeedwatson	i guess it was the season

2015-11-12 23:44:20	tomflint	just make sure you shake it a lot so you know it won't stick to your peel

2015-11-13 11:21:35	AlexJ44	did you see the post on the reddit?
2015-11-13 11:22:47	zxc232	I did yeah
2015-11-13 11:22:54	zxc232	but today was the first time I was on the sub
2015-11-13 11:23:48	AlexJ44	well
2015-11-13 11:24:16	AlexJ44	it's much more erudite and scholarly than /r/movies, that's for sure
2015-11-13 11:24:28	AlexJ44	if you're ok with that, then you're set and you'll enjoy it!
2015-11-13 11:25:01	zxc232	yeah I first checked out /r/movies and saw this on the sidebar
2015-11-13 11:25:46	AlexJ44	everyone's passionate about film
2015-11-13 11:25:52	zxc232	and music :)
2015-11-13 11:26:30	AlexJ44	there's r/letstalkmusic as well
2015-11-13 11:27:14	AlexJ44	so, what do you enjoy watching?
2015-11-13 11:27:22	zxc232	my tastes are more mainstream in film than music
2015-11-13 11:27:41	zxc232	there aren't many highly rated movies I haven't enjoyed
2015-11-13 11:27:53	AlexJ44	yeah, I feel you. I have only been seriously watching films for a year now
2015-11-13 11:28:06	AlexJ44	i've been into music for a while now, maybe 3 4?
2015-11-13 11:28:41	zxc232	yeah, I've been seriously into music since about 2008 and films around the same time but on a less consistent basis
2015-11-13 11:29:06	AlexJ44	well I recommend you track your films in IMDB or letterboxd
2015-11-13 11:29:12	AlexJ44	i enjoy both, but nwo prefer letterboxd
2015-11-13 11:29:15	zxc232	yeah I started doing that this year
2015-11-13 11:29:26	zxc232	I'll check that out right now
2015-11-13 11:29:41	zxc232	I've mostly used imdb as a way to keep a watchlist
2015-11-13 11:29:48	zxc232	same way I use goodreads for books
2015-11-13 11:30:42	zxc232	ah I see, a social network for film
2015-11-13 11:30:53	AlexJ44	I'm registered on goodreads, but barely ever use it
2015-11-13 11:30:57	AlexJ44	it's not that big where I live
2015-11-13 11:31:06	AlexJ44	and I annotate my readings on a notebook
2015-11-13 11:31:12	AlexJ44	seems more appropriate for the medium, heh :P
2015-11-13 11:31:31	zxc232	appropriate yes, but I primarily use it to find new things to check  out
2015-11-13 11:31:41	AlexJ44	and yes, letterboxd is a bit more social. there are a few missing features, but I enjoy it for what it is. looks a lot cleaner, and your feed consists of the stuff the people you follow watch
2015-11-13 11:31:42	zxc232	or more likely, to add to a list to check out and take forever in getting to
2015-11-13 11:31:59	AlexJ44	well maybe so, yeah
2015-11-13 11:32:22	AlexJ44	but since I don't really follow a "scene" or a "pattern" of reading like I do with film, it doesn't bother me
2015-11-13 11:33:07	zxc232	I find that the more time I spend watching films, the less time I spend reading
2015-11-13 11:33:11	zxc232	and vice versa
2015-11-13 11:33:24	AlexJ44	obviously, yeah
2015-11-13 11:33:25	zxc232	lately films have been winning out :/
2015-11-13 11:33:27	AlexJ44	I struggle with that as well
2015-11-13 11:33:34	AlexJ44	but I force myself to read too
2015-11-13 11:33:43	AlexJ44	and it's been working out pretty nicely
2015-11-13 11:34:18	zxc232	the problem is sometimes I don't want to leave a film
2015-11-13 11:34:36	zxc232	they can be so short
2015-11-13 11:34:48	AlexJ44	you can always rewatch them :P
2015-11-13 11:34:58	zxc232	I do!
2015-11-13 11:35:14	zxc232	I do that a lot with my favourite comedy shows
2015-11-13 11:35:15	AlexJ44	i think the first big lesson you have with film is that you can rewatch and it will be an as good or even better experince
2015-11-13 11:35:38	zxc232	that is the same with books and music I find
2015-11-13 11:36:40	AlexJ44	yes. I don't really rewatch films unless a while has passed
2015-11-13 11:36:58	zxc232	I used to rewatch them within months when I was starting out
2015-11-13 11:37:03	zxc232	sometimes within the week
2015-11-13 11:37:21	zxc232	but now I have a much longer cycle where I end up coming back to them and I don't remember all the details
2015-11-13 11:41:48	AlexJ44	so, what are you favorite ones?
2015-11-13 11:42:51	zxc232	before you arrived, I wrote out a few: Das Boot, The Third Man, LOTR, Dr Strangelove, Rear Window, The Thing, Memento, Pan's Labyrinth, The Maltese Falcon, North by Northwest
2015-11-13 11:43:21	AlexJ44	hmm I've only seen strangelove, Rear Window, The Thing and Memento
2015-11-13 11:43:26	AlexJ44	rear window is gorgeous
2015-11-13 11:43:32	zxc232	there are more to add, like Alien, The Life of Brian, Out of the Past, really I have a hard time picking favourites :)
2015-11-13 11:43:36	AlexJ44	have you seen vertigo?
2015-11-13 11:43:44	zxc232	I have
2015-11-13 11:43:48	zxc232	indeed rear window is gorgeous
2015-11-13 11:44:22	zxc232	I love how laid back it is, just showing what is happening
2015-11-13 11:45:09	AlexJ44	grace kelly was really something
2015-11-13 11:45:10	zxc232	for some reason the colour films of that time look really, really good
2015-11-13 11:45:13	AlexJ44	that hitchcock had an eye for it
2015-11-13 11:45:13	zxc232	indeed :)
2015-11-13 11:45:17	AlexJ44	yeah
2015-11-13 11:45:40	AlexJ44	it has to do with tecnicolor, I believe, but someone more knowledgeable can tell us more about it
2015-11-13 11:45:43	zxc232	I also love how she spoke in Rear Window
2015-11-13 11:45:49	AlexJ44	its colors are very strong
2015-11-13 11:47:03	zxc232	rear window is my favourite Hitchcock film (that I've seen so far)
2015-11-13 11:47:12	zxc232	Rope is another one I love
2015-11-13 11:47:30	zxc232	actually I'm very much into films set in one place
2015-11-13 11:47:48	AlexJ44	i don't know much about his films
2015-11-13 11:47:56	AlexJ44	but he's an interesting character
2015-11-13 11:48:02	AlexJ44	vertigo might interest you
2015-11-13 11:48:13	zxc232	yeah I've seen it, and love it
2015-11-13 11:48:19	AlexJ44	it's been a while since I watched rear window, but I was loving the apartment view where he was spying on the neighbours
2015-11-13 11:48:31	zxc232	that's pretty much the whole film :)
2015-11-13 11:48:39	AlexJ44	it was nice that you were also watching other people's lives and making up stories about them
2015-11-13 11:48:43	AlexJ44	I know
2015-11-13 11:48:46	AlexJ44	it was fun
2015-11-13 11:49:04	zxc232	I'd have quite a bit of fun in that wheelchair with the same view
2015-11-13 11:49:56	AlexJ44	hmm - depends on whether grace kelly is included or not :p
2015-11-13 11:50:24	zxc232	the key question
2015-11-13 11:50:46	zxc232	she was also in Dial M for Murder
2015-11-13 11:50:55	AlexJ44	I haven't seen that one either
2015-11-13 11:50:57	zxc232	another H film
2015-11-13 11:51:17	AlexJ44	Vertigo, Rear Window, Psycho, strangers on a train
2015-11-13 11:51:25	zxc232	haven't seen Psycho yet
2015-11-13 11:52:14	AlexJ44	yeah - i've only seen those 4
2015-11-13 11:52:25	zxc232	must see Psycho sometime
2015-11-13 11:52:51	zxc232	I read somewhere that H took some inspiration for it from Les Diaboliques
2015-11-13 11:53:01	zxc232	a French film from the 40s, quite chilling
2015-11-13 11:53:16	zxc232	actually it's from 1955, got that wrong
2015-11-13 11:53:44	AlexJ44	someday I'll do a hitchcock spree
2015-11-13 11:53:51	AlexJ44	I like doing that with some directors
2015-11-13 11:54:01	zxc232	I haven't done something like that before
2015-11-13 11:54:01	AlexJ44	i feel you learn a lot more than watching random films
2015-11-13 11:54:15	zxc232	that could well be the case
2015-11-13 11:54:33	zxc232	I've never watched films with the intent of learning about a director or filmmaking though
2015-11-13 11:54:37	AlexJ44	because you notice patterns in the filmmaking
2015-11-13 11:54:45	zxc232	just pure enjoyment for me
2015-11-13 11:55:56	AlexJ44	well, I enjoy cinema as well
2015-11-13 11:56:02	AlexJ44	but it interests me in another dimension too
2015-11-13 11:56:06	AlexJ44	something like academical
2015-11-13 11:56:13	AlexJ44	so, sometimes I'm also studying it
2015-11-13 11:56:22	AlexJ44	and I have to be aware of more things than the average movie goer
2015-11-13 11:56:26	AlexJ44	know what I mean?
2015-11-13 11:56:27	zxc232	I like reading reviews and seeing what they like to talk about
2015-11-13 11:56:34	AlexJ44	and I feel that kind of knowledge makes us enjoy films more
2015-11-13 11:56:52	zxc232	yeah I get it
2015-11-13 11:57:05	AlexJ44	reading reviews is very useful as well
2015-11-13 11:57:06	zxc232	ever since I started watching films more seriously my tastes have shifted
2015-11-13 11:57:51	zxc232	developed a liking for slow pace, long takes, and that kind of thing
2015-11-13 11:58:24	zxc232	and I'm just fascinated with the 1940s-50s era
2015-11-13 11:59:54	zxc232	it used to be the case that I would only watch spy thrillers and fantasies with lots of swordfighting
2015-11-13 11:59:59	zxc232	I still do a lot of that though :)
2015-11-13 12:00:50	zxc232	Le Samourai is a super classy exemplar of the former
2015-11-13 12:01:06	AlexJ44	I don't think I was ever much into action films
2015-11-13 12:01:13	AlexJ44	there was a phase, of course, but I didn't care much for films back then
2015-11-13 12:01:23	AlexJ44	have you seen the thread about wuxia films?
2015-11-13 12:01:33	zxc232	well for me LOTR and Gladiator are still favourites
2015-11-13 12:01:40	zxc232	I haven't
2015-11-13 12:01:50	zxc232	I only really came across the sub today and jumped straight into irc

2015-11-13 12:05:12	AlexJ44	and this first one's about wuxia films, and they explain what it is
2015-11-13 12:08:28	zxc232	those are some good ideas

2015-11-13 12:10:05	zxc232	the main genres I've been delving into semi-systematically are film noir and gothic

2015-11-13 12:15:28	AlexJ44	i remember watching that and really enjoying, an then most of the reviews said it was really inspired in film nori
2015-11-13 12:15:30	AlexJ44	noir*
2015-11-13 12:15:45	zxc232	I better have a look
2015-11-13 12:15:45	AlexJ44	are you new around, tecu?
2015-11-13 12:15:47	zxc232	seen Sin City?
2015-11-13 12:15:59	AlexJ44	i'll that that one to my watchlist.
2015-11-13 12:16:01	AlexJ44	and no, I haven't
2015-11-13 12:16:07	Sati1984__	Sin City 1 was amazing, but Sin City 2 was rather pointless IMO
2015-11-13 12:16:08	tecu	i've been around for a few months
2015-11-13 12:16:10	tecu	mostly just idling though
2015-11-13 12:16:32	AlexJ44	ah ok ok
2015-11-13 12:16:35	zxc232	I was going to say: Sin City is over the top noir (but really good)
2015-11-13 12:16:51	zxc232	haven't seen the second
2015-11-13 12:16:52	AlexJ44	you're allowed to idle, but being active is a lot better! :p
2015-11-13 12:17:06	AlexJ44	i've always been on the verge to watch sin city 1

2015-11-13 12:22:42	AlexJ44	but I hate rating films, because you're bound to have some incongruences after <50 ratings

2015-11-13 12:23:29	zxc232	I sometimes have a hard time rating films because I seem to give them all high ratings
2015-11-13 12:23:44	AlexJ44	yeah, me too. but critecker adapts to your ratins
2015-11-13 12:23:56	zxc232	either that or I have a great eye for what I would like
2015-11-13 12:23:56	AlexJ44	so, if you were to rate only between 100 and 90, it would consider your 90 to be a bad tier

2015-11-13 12:25:13	indeedwatson	zxc232: i like fps games too, i just think in that one, mood and atmosphere should take precedence, and the fact that you have guns makes it a little more actiony

2015-11-13 12:31:03	Sati1984__	the first 2 Paranormal Activity is OK
2015-11-13 12:31:07	zxc232	actually I wanted to catch Crimson Peak on IMAX but I think I've missed the window for that where I live
2015-11-13 12:31:16	FinisTerrae	Guillermo del Toro said Crimson Peak was supposed to be more of a Gothic Romance than Horror
2015-11-13 12:31:17	Sati1984__	3, 4 and The Marked Ones... you can skip
2015-11-13 12:31:30	indeedwatson	like i mentioned before, horror games have probably desensitized from horror movies
2015-11-13 12:31:48	indeedwatson	guillermo del toro was involved in a recent, cancelled silent hill game
2015-11-13 12:31:49	zxc232	FinisTerrae: I completely get the distinction being made
2015-11-13 12:31:57	indeedwatson	it looks VERY scary
2015-11-13 12:31:57	zxc232	I'm not really interested in being scared
2015-11-13 12:31:58	AlexJ44	i really enjoy the first one
2015-11-13 12:32:04	Porkepikk	FinisTerrae, oh yeah i see, thanks for the insight, i don't think i ever thought it was suppose to be horror too much, but i can understand the idea behind it
2015-11-13 12:32:23	zxc232	I found 28 Days Later very scary
2015-11-13 12:32:25	AlexJ44	indeedwatson:recommended the blair witch project but I'm afraid to watch it lol
2015-11-13 12:32:30	AlexJ44	yes! I've seen that one as well
2015-11-13 12:32:34	zxc232	especially towards the start, almost uncomfortable

2015-11-13 12:33:20	indeedwatson	i think i've actually been more scared with music lately than with movies lol
2015-11-13 12:33:30	zxc232	The Thing's soundtrack is amazing
2015-11-13 12:33:30	Porkepikk	how ?
2015-11-13 12:33:58	Porkepikk	just listening to music alone or in a movie ?
2015-11-13 12:34:10	indeedwatson	music alone
2015-11-13 12:34:27	AlexJ44	ha, depends on the music
2015-11-13 12:34:33	Porkepikk	yeah sometimes a song alone can cause some weird feelings
2015-11-13 12:34:38	Porkepikk	like the song from requiem for a dream
2015-11-13 12:34:41	AlexJ44	i wouldn't say scary, but uncomfortable and uneasy...for sure
2015-11-13 12:34:47	AlexJ44	oh gof that film
2015-11-13 12:34:55	AlexJ44	it's strong
2015-11-13 12:34:57	zxc232	I think I've heard req for a dream's music too much
2015-11-13 12:35:01	indeedwatson	AlexJ44: have you heard mahler's 6th?
2015-11-13 12:35:07	indeedwatson	it pretty much has jumpscares
2015-11-13 12:35:17	zxc232	haven't even seen the film and it puts me off watching it just because it's used everywhere
2015-11-13 12:35:30	AlexJ44	nope. but I enjoyed everything I've heard of himw
2015-11-13 12:35:53	Porkepikk	zxc232 => Oh yeah, i listen to it for the first time with the movie and it was the best shit ever, but all the conspiracy video killed it ...
2015-11-13 12:36:03	zxc232	heh
2015-11-13 12:36:04	indeedwatson	the 6th is famous cause the last movement has an instrument which is literally a huge wooden hammer
2015-11-13 12:36:39	zxc232	also I don't watch to watch the film because it's known to be depressing and I'm honestly not interested in that
2015-11-13 12:36:39	AlexJ44	i've only heard the first
2015-11-13 12:37:13	AlexJ44	the film is emotionally taxing, to say the least
2015-11-13 12:37:28	AlexJ44	but you don't win anything by not watching
2015-11-13 12:37:40	AlexJ44	it's a good film - or at least I thought so some 5 years ago
2015-11-13 12:37:51	zxc232	no will to watch it though
2015-11-13 12:37:58	AlexJ44	but I vividly remember the strong impression it left on me though
2015-11-13 12:38:05	AlexJ44	not something I get with other films
2015-11-13 12:38:20	Porkepikk	I loved to mother part, it was the best one to me
2015-11-13 12:38:53	zxc232	I think a lot of movies overuse musicc
2015-11-13 12:39:03	Sati1984__	Alien doesn't
2015-11-13 12:39:06	Porkepikk	do you have example ?
2015-11-13 12:39:09	Sati1984__	music is kept to minimal
2015-11-13 12:39:14	zxc232	I don't have examples off the top of my head
2015-11-13 12:39:22	zxc232	Sati1984__: Alien's a favourite of mine for good reason
2015-11-13 12:39:31	Porkepikk	cause if you're talking about big hollywood production i agree, for the rest i think the state of music in movies is fine
2015-11-13 12:39:42	indeedwatson	AlexJ44: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCr79zXor24 wait for it
2015-11-13 12:40:21	indeedwatson	oh wait they don't show it
2015-11-13 12:41:26	indeedwatson	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDjUWH1Ot0o
2015-11-13 12:42:15	indeedwatson	i have an example of overused music: interstellar :p
2015-11-13 12:42:32	AlexJ44	haha, that's fun
2015-11-13 12:42:37	AlexJ44	I haven't watched interstellar
2015-11-13 12:42:38	zxc232	that almighty hammer
2015-11-13 12:42:46	zxc232	I loved Interstellar
2015-11-13 12:43:05	indeedwatson	how many times have you seen it
2015-11-13 12:43:12	zxc232	just the once
2015-11-13 12:43:25	AlexJ44	nolan's films must be judged on the second viewing
2015-11-13 12:43:32	AlexJ44	because he uses exposition so much
2015-11-13 12:43:46	Porkepikk	indeedwatson => Fuck i was thinking to myself and thought the same ! I prefer 2001 for obvious reason, music is not overused in this one
2015-11-13 12:43:49	AlexJ44	i'm a bit neutral in that matter, because I think he's a smart and capable filmmaker
2015-11-13 12:43:50	zxc232	well I didn't like Inception nearly as much as most people did
2015-11-13 12:43:54	AlexJ44	and inception is really good
2015-11-13 12:44:03	indeedwatson	they get worse on repeated viewings, minus memento and TDK probably
2015-11-13 12:44:14	indeedwatson	TDK mostly cause heath
2015-11-13 12:44:15	zxc232	but I really loved Memento (seen several times)
2015-11-13 12:44:27	AlexJ44	no love for inception indeedwatson?
2015-11-13 12:44:29	indeedwatson	i have a theory that memento is accidentally good
2015-11-13 12:44:34	AlexJ44	haha
2015-11-13 12:44:39	Porkepikk	Memento was nolan's brother idea
2015-11-13 12:44:45	AlexJ44	he made memento on accident :P
2015-11-13 12:44:49	indeedwatson	AlexJ44: i like it, but i don't think it gets much better on repeated viewings
2015-11-13 12:45:01	zxc232	maybe he made Memento and then slowly forgot how to do it
2015-11-13 12:45:35	indeedwatson	well in most other films, i feel his editing is kind of choppy and awkward, but that happens to fit memento's narrative really well
2015-11-13 12:46:39	zxc232	with inception, I just didn't like how it turned into an action film towards the end
2015-11-13 12:46:55	indeedwatson	agreed
2015-11-13 12:47:13	zxc232	snow's pretty cool though...
2015-11-13 12:47:19	zxc232	don't get any of that in melbourne
2015-11-13 12:47:30	Sati1984__	Inception has nice action and visuals, but the plot was a bit meh
2015-11-13 12:47:35	indeedwatson	i recall someone making an analysis of the 1st scene of inception and saying it was really bad and unecessary
2015-11-13 12:47:42	indeedwatson	but i can't recall who it was
2015-11-13 12:48:00	Porkepikk	It's stupid but my biggest pet peeve with inception is mario cottillard, there are better french actress out there
2015-11-13 12:48:21	AlexJ44	i'm a sucker for inception
2015-11-13 12:48:23	Porkepikk	seriously if i see her one more time in a nolan movie, they're both dead to me :P
2015-11-13 12:48:33	indeedwatson	but she's cute
2015-11-13 12:48:34	AlexJ44	maybe i'd change my opinion now, but I think it's a well worked movie
2015-11-13 12:48:39	AlexJ44	wait
2015-11-13 12:48:46	Porkepikk	Adèle Exarchopoulos is waaaayy better looking
2015-11-13 12:48:46	AlexJ44	melanie laurent wins in that department
2015-11-13 12:48:58	AlexJ44	it's different
2015-11-13 12:49:02	AlexJ44	adele is newer
2015-11-13 12:49:12	AlexJ44	and they're not exactly competing for the same role
2015-11-13 12:49:13	indeedwatson	Porkepikk: adele is probably the prettiest woman i've ever seen
2015-11-13 12:49:23	Porkepikk	yeah i'm just talking look, being a creep here ^^
2015-11-13 12:49:37	Porkepikk	but adèle will never be able to play those kind of roles, we do agree
2015-11-13 12:49:37	indeedwatson	she was probably too young for inception
2015-11-13 12:49:47	AlexJ44	yeah - and they already had ellen page for the cutie role
2015-11-13 12:49:50	indeedwatson	"this is my experienced dreamer wife, who looks 16"
2015-11-13 12:49:53	Porkepikk	she was nobody, i was not saying adèle could have played the role
2015-11-13 12:49:55	AlexJ44	LOL
2015-11-13 12:50:17	AlexJ44	suddenly Inception has a lolita subplot
2015-11-13 12:50:22	Porkepikk	i just said she was better looking
2015-11-13 12:50:29	AlexJ44	well she is, absolutely
2015-11-13 12:50:30	indeedwatson	well elen page does look 13 already
2015-11-13 12:50:46	AlexJ44	but - laurent tops marion easily
2015-11-13 12:50:50	AlexJ44	not so sure about adele
2015-11-13 12:51:00	Porkepikk	i also don't really like elen page, but that's because of beyond two soul
2015-11-13 12:51:01	indeedwatson	i don't think i could've watched all of blue is the warmest color if i didnt fall in love with adele
2015-11-13 12:51:25	AlexJ44	i like her because of juno
2015-11-13 12:51:28	AlexJ44	to me, she's always been juno
2015-11-13 12:52:16	indeedwatson	haven't seen that
2015-11-13 12:52:22	indeedwatson	but she was ok in super
2015-11-13 12:52:37	AlexJ44	as for blue, i dont want to sound mysoginist 56

2015-11-13 12:54:37	Porkepikk	indeedwatson => you need to read the trivia about the movie on imdb, the whole movie was about making the actresses crazy
2015-11-13 12:54:39	zxc232	AlexJ444: how did you dispose of the body?
2015-11-13 12:55:00	Sati1984__	your collegaue has no creativity
2015-11-13 12:55:14	Porkepikk	"There was controversy surrounding Abdellatif Kechiche and his work methods. It was revealed that he would do hundreds of takes for small scenes to achieve the desired realism of the story. Both actresses stated that the film looks so real because Kechiche pushed them to their breaking point, and that they were really struggling."
2015-11-13 12:55:28	Sati1984__	ah, the Kubrick method
2015-11-13 12:55:51	Porkepikk	also the only really weird scene was the dream one, and it's cause it's the first one shot : "The first scene the actresses shot together was Adèle's dream sequence."
2015-11-13 12:55:53	Sati1984__	well then I have to be off now

2015-11-13 12:56:16	AlexJ444	I've read that they were uncomfortable with so many sex scenes, but now about that

2015-11-13 12:56:29	Porkepikk	no ... sorry i don't have a crazy english vocabulary, what i meant is that he tried to make it real by making the actresses more involved
2015-11-13 12:56:36	Porkepikk	by pushing them to their limits

2015-11-13 14:53:19	@Carson	slow day
2015-11-13 15:04:40	Porkepikk	I'm trying to do research about the shower scene in Schindler's list, i'm sure i'm not the only one who thought that scene was bullshit cause of the resolution
2015-11-13 15:05:04	Porkepikk	Them, crying of joy when they should have lost all their hope. How entertainment they made the holocaust
2015-11-13 15:05:13	Porkepikk	but so far i struggle to find people who already wrote about that
2015-11-13 15:17:42	indeedwatson	aw we missed frdom twice
2015-11-13 15:17:54	indeedwatson	Porkepikk: i don't even remember it
2015-11-13 15:18:57	Porkepikk	i'm thinking of making a video about it, cause i'm not great at writing. Cause i don't understand the hype this movie has, i find it so wrong.
2015-11-13 15:19:37	Porkepikk	not saying i'm right tho, i would just like to discuss it and share my pov
2015-11-13 15:20:38	indeedwatson	wrong because of that scene?
2015-11-13 15:21:04	Porkepikk	not only that scene
2015-11-13 15:21:20	Porkepikk	I think it's wrong to portray a real person the hollywood way
2015-11-13 15:21:33	Porkepikk	The end of the movie is over dramatic
2015-11-13 15:21:56	indeedwatson	i don't think right or wrong have much to do with a movie's quality but i know a lot of people disagree
2015-11-13 15:22:39	Porkepikk	Also that scene after the raid in the jew ghetto, where they show the little girl being saved and it's suppose to relief the spectator like "Ooooh at least she is alive" and i'm shocked cause it's wrong to create entertainment out of something that was just 100% tragic such as the holocaust
2015-11-13 15:23:31	Porkepikk	Schindler's list to me, is just hollywood trying to make people feel like they're smart
2015-11-13 15:23:35	Porkepikk	watching a B&W movie
2015-11-13 15:23:42	Porkepikk	with so many "shocking" scenes ...
2015-11-13 15:24:13	Porkepikk	and look at the red coat ! It's so poetic and symbolic ... (sorry i'm kinda making a rant i know)
2015-11-13 15:26:11	indeedwatson	have you seen band of brothers?
2015-11-13 15:30:33	Porkepikk	not really
2015-11-13 15:30:39	Porkepikk	saw an episode a long time ago

2015-11-14 01:00:20	AlexJ44	i'm not sure you know what I mean
2015-11-14 01:01:05	RyanSmallwood	I've only seen Ordet once and years ago but I remember liking it
2015-11-14 01:02:53	RyanSmallwood	AlexJ44: distanced how?
2015-11-14 01:03:33	AlexJ44	I don't know - maybe when you take that historical background and academic knowledge, it can cloud your emotional judgement of a film
2015-11-14 01:03:57	AlexJ44	it gets too analytical and not personal enough
2015-11-14 01:04:01	AlexJ44	can you relate to that? does it make sense?
2015-11-14 01:04:15	AlexJ44	maybe not much
2015-11-14 01:04:45	RyanSmallwood	I think certain films I've appreciated more from learning more history and context
2015-11-14 01:05:01	RyanSmallwood	I do have films that I like mostly because of their context, but I wouldn't recommend them just as films to anyone
2015-11-14 01:06:42	AlexJ44	I don't know
2015-11-14 01:06:58	AlexJ44	maybe I have a small film background to generalise my idea
2015-11-14 01:11:39	AlexJ44	anyway, I'm going to sleep now
2015-11-14 01:11:43	AlexJ44	i'll see you tomorrow1

2015-11-14 11:03:10	indeedwatson	i was at a friend's so i didn't hear much
2015-11-14 11:03:31	AlexJ44	ISIS attack at paris
2015-11-14 11:03:36	AlexJ44	100 ish dead
2015-11-14 11:04:13	indeedwatson	damn
2015-11-14 11:04:17	AlexJ44	it might not be very relevant in argentina, but europe has been struggling a lot because of this
2015-11-14 11:05:01	indeedwatson	a few weeks ago there was a bomb threat in a mall, but nothing happened i think
2015-11-14 11:05:26	AlexJ44	because of the migrants coming from syria, the fear of the muslim religion, and the thriving of far-right parties
2015-11-14 11:05:29	AlexJ44	it's complex :(
2015-11-14 11:05:41	AlexJ44	anyway, I'm stacking for the weekend
2015-11-14 11:05:47	AlexJ44	got 2 wuxia, 1 kubrick and 1 bergman

2015-11-14 11:19:19	AlexJ44	RyanSmallwood - it's truffaut's book, called "The Films in My Life"
2015-11-14 11:19:26	AlexJ44	haha which one is it?
2015-11-14 11:20:01	RyanSmallwood	Ahh, there's a great book where Truffaut interviewed Hitchcock about every Hitchcock film
2015-11-14 11:20:08	RyanSmallwood	its one of the best books on film I've ever read

2015-11-14 11:21:48	AlexJ44	RyanSmallwood, it's a collection of essays about film
2015-11-14 11:22:03	indeedwatson	i haven't even seen any truffaut yet :(
2015-11-14 11:22:14	indeedwatson	AlexJ44: baladamenti's?
2015-11-14 11:22:21	AlexJ44	nope - it's really david lynch
2015-11-14 11:23:10	AlexJ44	truffaut was very enthusiastic about hitchcock
2015-11-14 11:23:36	AlexJ44	it probably has to do with his auteur theory - he fought among the critics to consider Hitchcock as an auteur
2015-11-14 11:23:51	indeedwatson	well i actually can't click it cause there's something wrong with my urxvt
2015-11-14 11:23:55	AlexJ44	he talks a bit about kubrick and bergman as well
2015-11-14 11:24:01	AlexJ44	and he even argues about paths of glory
2015-11-14 11:24:36	AlexJ44	it's not anything out of this world indeedwatson, it's just a simple good song

2015-11-14 12:57:50	pmcinern	ryan, the only copy of zu i could, you know, buy, is an mkv file with dual audio, hindi and the original chinese (cantonese?). Of course, the hindi is the default audio track, and cytube doesn't let you select audio tracks. on a mac, which conveniently only recognizes .mov files. is that tolerable?
2015-11-14 13:00:32	pmcinern	anyone here know how to remove audio tracks from an mkv on a mac?
2015-11-14 13:00:43	RyanSmallwood	I think you could use handbrake

2015-11-14 13:05:27	uguuuu	https://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/ can remove tracks from mkv

2015-11-14 13:06:36	pmcinern	nice, thank you!
2015-11-14 13:07:19	RyanSmallwood	any idea if there will be more people at the 2pm or 8pm screenings?
2015-11-14 13:09:21	pmcinern	no, this is kind of a test run to see what works and doesn't. i got a stickied post on fullmoviesonyoutube, and someone x-posted to kungfucinema, so i'm not sure what that's gonna yield
2015-11-14 13:10:57	pmcinern	anyone here coming by today?
2015-11-14 13:11:05	Suvarna	pmcicern, use mkvmergeGUI
2015-11-14 13:11:15	Suvarna	or what uguuu suggested
2015-11-14 13:12:53	RyanSmallwood	I won't be able to watch all day, but I'll probably attend 1 or 2 of the screenings
2015-11-14 13:12:56	pmcinern	thank you!
2015-11-14 13:12:59	indeedwatson	pmcinern: i think it'd help if you said X hours from this post or something like that, cause people can be lazy with time convertions
2015-11-14 13:14:03	pmcinern	Good point. How far out do you think?
2015-11-14 13:14:12	pmcinern	1 hour?
2015-11-14 13:14:48	indeedwatson	a bit more to be safe
2015-11-14 13:15:05	pmcinern	cool
2015-11-14 13:16:48	pmcinern	after hong kong is done (it'll take a few months probably), what would you guys like to see screened and talked about?
2015-11-14 13:18:49	indeedwatson	i dont know if it's possible or if anyone else would be into it, but i'd like to have director's commentaries as a theme, and screen some movies with them
2015-11-14 13:19:00	pmcinern	oh snap
2015-11-14 13:19:40	pmcinern	that's really good. where do you find commentaries online?

2015-11-14 13:21:33	Pmcinern	Yea
2015-11-14 13:25:49	Pmcinern	That may not fit into to better know a movement, but that's really good. People talk about commentaries all the time
2015-11-14 13:26:23	Pmcinern	I'll see if I can do something with that
2015-11-14 13:26:56	indeedwatson	yeah i know, it could be something for the future
2015-11-14 13:27:35	indeedwatson	i don't know which commentaries are considered a 'must' 
2015-11-14 13:28:08	Pmcinern	Right, but guaranteed there are blogs or something devoted to them
2015-11-14 13:28:42	Pmcinern	Didn't Ebert win an award for his citizen Kane or casablanca commentary?
2015-11-14 13:29:21	indeedwatson	i never followed ebert so i've no idea, im sure someone here or in the sub knows
2015-11-14 13:31:17	Pmcinern	...I've been meaning to ask this. Forgive the newb question, but is this irc really where truefilm lurkers go? Like, are most of the people here just subscribers that don't comment a lot?
2015-11-14 13:32:55	indeedwatson	i don't think so, i comment every now and then but im just always in irc
2015-11-14 13:33:09	indeedwatson	i didn't start ircing specifically for this channel
2015-11-14 13:33:54	Pmcinern	Oooh, so it's more that people on this website found this channel?
2015-11-14 13:34:06	indeedwatson	i actually had looked for a truefilm irc in the past and looked again like a day after it was created
2015-11-14 13:34:37	indeedwatson	but there's also a lot of people like you who came in recently due to the post Carson_ made
2015-11-14 13:35:03	Porkepik	It's for the real truetruefilm viewers and critics :D
2015-11-14 13:35:27	Porkepik	no for real, i lurk cause i'm still new to the sub and i haven't found a subject where i would want and need to express myself
2015-11-14 13:36:51	indeedwatson	but as you can see, there's also irc lurkers, usually called idlers
2015-11-14 13:37:29	Pmcinern	Gotcha. And is the tone here that you'd want more people involved, or that more people = watering this irc down? Because with 80,000 suscribers, there's probably a lot of people who feel the same way
2015-11-14 13:38:14	Pmcinern	I can see ed how having 200 ppl in this irc would be a mad house though

2015-11-14 13:40:18	Pmcinern	What do we do to get people talking?
2015-11-14 13:40:41	Porkepik	Here or on the sub ? Usually on the sub you gotta talk famous movie
2015-11-14 13:40:48	Porkepik	like Nolan movies or Kubrick etc ...
2015-11-14 13:40:58	Porkepik	obviously old french movie won't get many people to talk
2015-11-14 13:41:16	Pmcinern	Right. I was thinking about trying a "if you like... then you'll love..." thing
2015-11-14 13:41:26	Porkepik	oh yeah that could be cool
2015-11-14 13:42:24	Pmcinern	The way I see it, the things that get the most talk don't deserve it, and the things that deserve it don't get it. Bit they don't
2015-11-14 13:42:36	Pmcinern	But they don't get it because no one knows about it
2015-11-14 13:42:42	Pmcinern	And thus has nothing to say.
2015-11-14 13:42:51	Porkepik	r/truefilm is not as bad as /r/movies for that
2015-11-14 13:42:57	Pmcinern	Yea
2015-11-14 13:43:23	Porkepik	r/movies is where nolan is the new kubrick and requiem for a dream the most shocking movie ever made :P

2015-11-14 13:45:01	zxc232	and this is definitely a talkative channel for only having ~30 people
2015-11-14 13:45:41	Pmcinern	Right. But what do you like to talk about?
2015-11-14 13:46:29	zxc232	I'll let you know when I think of something :)
2015-11-14 13:47:02	Pmcinern	Like for me, a lot of times I feel stupid putting my two cents in on the sub, for a lot of rreasons. I don't have the knowledge base that most people there do on what gets talked about a lot
2015-11-14 13:47:16	Pmcinern	I don't know shit about the French new wave
2015-11-14 13:47:21	Pmcinern	But I love kung fu

2015-11-14 15:20:15	AlexJ44_	yes
2015-11-14 15:20:18	AlexJ44_	"Arguably, the film was part of a wave that helped to inspire national educational curriculum changes, the growth of Holocaust degree programmes, the institution of an annual remembrance day in the United Kingdom and the setting up of museums and memorials across the globe. As a result, it is no longer respectable in Western countries, in public at least, to deny the Holocaust."
2015-11-14 15:20:40	Porkepik	As the famous Jewish-American director Stanley Kubrick is reputed to have said: “Think that was about the Holocaust? That was about success, wasn’t it? The Holocaust is about six million people who get killed. Schindler’s List was about six hundred people who don’t.”
2015-11-14 15:21:05	AlexJ44_	I didn't know about that quote

2015-11-17 21:42:01	f91w_	I'm trying to find a Japanese film, made (somewhat) recently, based in WW2. They are a battalion on some island waiting for an American invasion. I recall horses being a part of the film. Everything moved slowly and there was no combat.
2015-11-17 21:42:05	f91w_	Any ideas?
2015-11-17 21:43:03	Card74	Hmm, I've read about a movie like that...
2015-11-17 21:43:25	*	Card74 tries to jog his poor memory.
2015-11-17 21:45:44	Card74	recently? There's The Burmese Harp, but it's from 60s and there are no horses in it...

And a bunch of people jumped in with their crazy theories and screenshots of old movies for proof to explain  how they were Wrongy Mcwrongerson and didn't understand how capitalism work

2015-11-18 21:18:20	Dema	I've only seen the latest version, 2010. It really is quite lovely.
2015-11-18 21:19:58	indeedwatson	is that kinda movie worth downloading in high video quality?
2015-11-18 21:21:27	keqin	RyanSmallwood rn I dont yet have much to say about the mode of production of film and how that contributes to racial inequality... but in regards to how the Other is available thru film, there has been a lot written on the subject
2015-11-18 21:21:40	Dema	Yeah, I would say so. Considering all the restoration they've done to it, it would be a shame to not
2015-11-18 21:21:51	Porkepik	indeedwatson => Why didn't you like Paprika ? It's awesome
2015-11-18 21:22:02	Porkepik	I think i even liked it better than Akira
2015-11-18 21:22:10	keqin	indeedwatson What Paprika was awesomeee
2015-11-18 21:22:21	indeedwatson	Porkepik: it was a long time ago, but i didn't feel anything for the characters, and i felt their development was kinda dull and out of nowhere
2015-11-18 21:22:25	Dema	I'm still trying to wrap my head around what's going on in that thread.
2015-11-18 21:22:26	indeedwatson	Porkepik: wat that is blasphemy
2015-11-18 21:22:48	Porkepik	No, i just want your opinion on it
2015-11-18 21:22:53	Porkepik	Did you like Inception ?
2015-11-18 21:23:09	indeedwatson	yeah
2015-11-18 21:23:13	indeedwatson	i do want to rewatch
2015-11-18 21:23:37	indeedwatson	but i was just surprised at how much i loved perfect blue, and was disappointed with paprika
2015-11-18 21:23:51	indeedwatson	i mean the animation and art style and all of that was great
2015-11-18 21:23:59	Porkepik	You prefered Inception to Paprika ?
2015-11-18 21:24:14	Porkepik	Cause after seeing Paprika, i now kinda dislike Inception ...
2015-11-18 21:24:23	indeedwatson	i guess i the time i focused more on the characters and i recall some romance at the end that came out of nowhere
2015-11-18 21:24:32	keqin	i havent seen inception since it came out
2015-11-18 21:24:47	indeedwatson	plot aside, i think they're pretty different, but i probably like paprika more
2015-11-18 21:25:24	indeedwatson	am i too wrong in what im saying about the characters?
2015-11-18 21:25:38	keqin	paprika is not about character
2015-11-18 21:25:45	keqin	relationship between image, movie, dream, etc
2015-11-18 21:25:54	keqin	is more what kon is trying to get u to think about
2015-11-18 21:26:14	keqin	and reality i forget to mention
2015-11-18 21:26:58	keqin	well, i think it's less about character IMO but i should study it again
2015-11-18 21:27:07	indeedwatson	was there a bit of romance in the end? or am i misremembering?
2015-11-18 21:27:14	yurikuma	there was
2015-11-18 21:27:26	indeedwatson	keqin: yeah that's what i wanna do
2015-11-18 21:27:57	indeedwatson	but if it wasn't about the characters, that romance felt forced, and since it was near the end it's probably what stuck the most in my mind

2015-11-18 21:30:21	keqin	yeah other than the fact that theyre both animation, we might have to try to compare them along different lines

2015-11-18 21:34:05	Porkepik	And honestly, i can't really say that

2015-11-18 21:34:25	Porkepik	Just that i was not expecting to love Paprika that much
2015-11-18 21:34:33	Porkepik	While i knew that Akira was gonna be awesome
2015-11-18 21:34:45	Porkepik	The surprise effect always works better
2015-11-18 21:35:37	keqin	well they are both science fiction
2015-11-18 21:36:04	keqin	and both contain childlike characters that gain unprecedented power
2015-11-18 21:36:14	indeedwatson	my thing with akira is that i've liked it since i was 11
2015-11-18 21:36:38	keqin	the childlike figure is an archetype of the postwar japanese story too
2015-11-18 21:36:38	indeedwatson	and it's very rare that i view something as a good piece of art for so long

2015-11-18 21:41:37	keqin	?
2015-11-18 21:41:44	yurikuma	nvm i was thinking of a different parade
2015-11-18 21:42:01	indeedwatson	i will try to rewatch it high
2015-11-18 21:42:07	keqin	lulz
2015-11-18 21:42:28	keqin	well anyway the point im making is that both akira and paprika share some things that go beyond just being animation, so your comparison might be warranted
2015-11-18 21:42:47	indeedwatson	yeah but the tone is so different
2015-11-18 21:43:08	indeedwatson	and akira is about the characters
2015-11-18 21:43:14	yurikuma	they share elements sure buts that like saying every movie with a shootout is the same
2015-11-18 21:43:23	yurikuma	or similar
2015-11-18 21:43:24	keqin	i mean u could go as far as saying theyre both about society trying to defend themselves against the total destruction by the force of either a nuclear-like power or a dream-like power
2015-11-18 21:43:58	keqin	but the elements in akira and paprika are related
2015-11-18 21:44:04	keqin	theyre not just shootouts
2015-11-18 21:44:21	Porkepik	Fuck Paprika only has 7.7
2015-11-18 21:44:27	Porkepik	when inception is at 8.9 i think
2015-11-18 21:44:33	keqin	now that ive thought about it, the shootouts seem to be motivated by some common anxiety
2015-11-18 21:44:38	yurikuma	yeah its pretty sad but imdb ratings suck anyways so who cares
2015-11-18 21:44:44	Porkepik	Yeah i know
2015-11-18 21:44:57	Porkepik	Well tommorow, it will be perfect blue !

2015-11-18 21:45:35	yurikuma	thats the only satoshi kon i have yet to see lol, unless u count paranoia agent
2015-11-18 21:45:51	indeedwatson	i have to watch millenial actress
2015-11-18 21:46:13	yurikuma	millenium actress is his weakest imo but  its still good

2015-11-18 21:47:10	yurikuma	only way to get better is through practice
2015-11-18 21:48:09	indeedwatson	aw, i was hoping it was similar to perfect blue
2015-11-18 21:48:21	keqin	it sorta is
2015-11-18 21:48:29	keqin	but perfect blue is almost perfect lol
2015-11-18 21:48:42	keqin	like usually id say that flashbacks and waking up from dreams is cliche
2015-11-18 21:48:48	yurikuma	eeehh the animation is kinda weak in that movie
2015-11-18 21:49:08	yurikuma	and i  always felt it would be better in live action
2015-11-18 21:49:13	keqin	intersting
2015-11-18 21:49:16	keqin	japan should remake it

2015-11-18 21:50:02	Porkepik	Like Akira, they also apparently tried for Paprika
2015-11-18 21:50:15	keqin	YO im just gonna say this
2015-11-18 21:50:31	keqin	anime is at the forefront of what movies can accomplish - in terms of their commentary on contemporary society
2015-11-18 21:50:55	indeedwatson	i think that's a very small niche within anime
2015-11-18 21:51:14	Porkepik	i don't watch anime, and i prefer to call movies like Ghibli and Kon Japanese Animation
2015-11-18 21:51:14	yurikuma	if u watch alot of anime most of it is prettty bad :/
2015-11-18 21:51:17	indeedwatson	most of it is cliche highschool power fantasies
2015-11-18 21:51:33	indeedwatson	Porkepik: that is pretty much the literal definition of anime tho
2015-11-18 21:51:34	keqin	alright, but still
2015-11-18 21:51:43	Porkepik	Yeah i know
2015-11-18 21:51:50	indeedwatson	also, there's a pretty big gap in quality between anime films and anime series
2015-11-18 21:52:04	Porkepik	but when i have to explain a Ghibli movie to someone, i prefer to call it like that, so there is no confusion
2015-11-18 21:52:05	indeedwatson	i tried so hard to find a really good anime show that's recent

2015-11-18 21:56:16	indeedwatson	but i don't think anything he did is as good as mindgames imo
2015-11-18 21:56:18	indeedwatson	haha yeah
2015-11-18 21:56:50	yurikuma	ping pong is the greatest tv series ever made so if mind game is better ill be happy

2015-11-18 21:59:23	keqin	they should do anime as "better know a movement"

2015-11-18 22:00:56	yurikuma	like nascar?

2015-11-18 22:03:23	keqin	they were both threads in TF in regards to race in movie
2015-11-18 22:03:32	yurikuma	lol seems absolutely ridiculous at first glance
2015-11-18 22:03:36	keqin	and were both highly downvoted
2015-11-18 22:04:00	Pmcinern	Keep talking anime. I interrupted.
2015-11-18 22:04:27	keqin	honestly I think there IS a bias against what the mainstream deems as Other
2015-11-18 22:04:43	keqin	cuz why else would we remake anime with white characters
2015-11-18 22:05:12	yurikuma	im assuming your refering to the akira remake casting?
2015-11-18 22:05:22	yurikuma	or am i totally wrong
2015-11-18 22:05:37	keqin	dragonball, GITS, Akira, Avatar, etc
2015-11-18 22:06:12	yurikuma	eh, idk i dont really feel very strongly about this kinda thing, although that may be cuz im white
2015-11-18 22:06:48	yurikuma	but yeah whitewashing the race like in avatar or whatever is pretty stupid
2015-11-18 22:06:55	yurikuma	but isnt that self evident?
2015-11-18 22:07:02	yurikuma	not much discussion possible imo
2015-11-18 22:07:15	Pmcinern	Well it's not an anti
2015-11-18 22:07:32	Pmcinern	Abti-OTHER. it's pro-US
2015-11-18 22:08:04	Pmcinern	Japanese animation depicting whites makes them look slightly Japanese
2015-11-18 22:08:39	yurikuma	well japan is famously xenophobic so thats no surprise
2015-11-18 22:09:51	Pmcinern	Yeah. I agree with you though. I'm not really interested unless people are actively being hurt by something
2015-11-18 22:10:17	keqin	microaggressions exist, though - theyre invisible threats
2015-11-18 22:10:31	yurikuma	well attitudes are pervasive and can lead to more harmful behavoir
2015-11-18 22:10:46	Pmcinern	Microagressions. Sounds interesting. Examples?

2015-11-18 22:15:10	yurikuma	when u can just go watch birth of a nation

2015-11-18 22:21:39	yurikuma	nah hes hungarian or something idk
2015-11-18 22:21:55	Dema	Hungarians are white European.
2015-11-18 22:22:04	yurikuma	or arabic
2015-11-18 22:22:07	yurikuma	idk lol

2015-11-18 22:22:26	Porkepik	(I mean without turkey)
2015-11-18 22:22:36	keqin	i mean okay
2015-11-18 22:22:44	yurikuma	he seems like such a euro villian though
2015-11-18 22:22:54	keqin	what does that mean
2015-11-18 22:23:17	Dema	I think he treads a fine line between middle eastern and Eastern European in the film
2015-11-18 22:23:20	yurikuma	as in a villian stereotypically from europe
2015-11-18 22:23:32	Dema	But really in the comics he's more Arabic.
2015-11-18 22:23:44	yurikuma	i dont read any comics so i wouldnt know
2015-11-18 22:23:46	Porkepik	Nolan's movies are actually very white

2015-11-18 22:25:05	yurikuma	saw it just yesterday in fact
2015-11-18 22:25:27	Dema	Malcolm X is a personal favorite.

2015-11-18 22:25:41	Dema	Spike Lee is a great director
2015-11-18 22:25:47	yurikuma	oh yeah and ive listened to fight the power from do the right thing
2015-11-18 22:25:51	Porkepik	i mean i wouldn't call him great personally
2015-11-18 22:25:53	yurikuma	but thats only cuz im a huge public enemy fan
2015-11-18 22:25:53	Porkepik	good maybe
2015-11-18 22:25:54	Dema	It's just some of his latest stuff hasn't been great
2015-11-18 22:26:13	yurikuma	is francis ford coppola a terrible director cuz he made a few bad movies?
2015-11-18 22:27:05	Dema	I wouldn't say so. It's like saying Nas is a bad rapper because he has crappy choice in beats.
2015-11-18 22:27:25	Dema	Sometimes what you feel best isn't necessarily right.
2015-11-18 22:27:51	Porkepik	Yeah but in Spike Lee case, it's pretty mixed
2015-11-18 22:28:01	yurikuma	generally its more nuanced then just saying a director is good or baad
2015-11-18 22:28:10	yurikuma	they all have some strenghts and some flaws
2015-11-18 22:28:19	yurikuma	except wong kar wai

2015-11-18 22:29:08	Porkepik	And thousands of others
2015-11-18 22:29:32	Dema	Tommy Wiseau had a vision

2015-11-18 22:29:52	Porkepik	That's the only reason he is relevant
2015-11-18 22:30:03	yurikuma	well and he made the room
2015-11-18 22:30:03	Porkepik	yeah, he is pretty unique
2015-11-18 22:30:12	Porkepik	The Room is a meme too
2015-11-18 22:30:23	Porkepik	But those underwears, they are 100% serious
2015-11-18 22:30:25	Dema	Yeah. But I get tons of enjoyment from The Room. Anything beyond that notes me.

2015-11-18 22:31:33	yurikuma	i can see why you wouldnt like it but i loved it
2015-11-18 22:31:36	Dema	Speaking of hit or miss, I just finished watching Trance
2015-11-18 22:31:41	yurikuma	that cinematography was brilliant
2015-11-18 22:33:00	yurikuma	was trance bad or good
2015-11-18 22:33:41	RyanSmallwood	I don't understand all the grandmaster naysayers, I liked it a bunch
2015-11-18 22:33:59	Dema	It was alright.
2015-11-18 22:34:08	yurikuma	the narrative was incredibly confusing
2015-11-18 22:34:15	Porkepik	TIL the word naysayers
2015-11-18 22:34:23	Dema	I can see people really digging it but I just didn't care about the characters
2015-11-18 22:34:43	Dema	And yeah the narrative was a bit funky.
2015-11-18 22:34:50	RyanSmallwood	the US cut is also very different from the Chinese cut
2015-11-18 22:34:53	yurikuma	it was pretty scattershot in terms of story which led to somewhat bland characters
2015-11-18 22:35:38	yurikuma	i mean i loved it anyways but i can see the flaws
2015-11-18 22:35:48	yurikuma	and why some people didnt like it all that much
2015-11-18 22:35:51	keqin	RyanSmallwood what motivated the different cuts?
2015-11-18 22:35:59	yurikuma	harvey weinstein did
2015-11-18 22:36:13	RyanSmallwood	Wong Kar Wai being crazy
2015-11-18 22:36:20	RyanSmallwood	he said he made the US cut for US kung fu fans
2015-11-18 22:36:29	keqin	interesting
2015-11-18 22:36:34	RyanSmallwood	and his own personal cut is like 4 hours long or something but he doesn't think anyone else will like it
2015-11-18 22:36:43	yurikuma	where did u read that? i read that it was harvey who wanted to cut it cuz its harvey
2015-11-18 22:36:45	RyanSmallwood	both cuts have material that isn't in the other, so neither is "uncut"
2015-11-18 22:36:54	yurikuma	wong kar wai supervised the us cut
2015-11-18 22:37:01	yurikuma	only reason i even watched it
2015-11-18 22:37:29	RyanSmallwood	Gong Er is more the protagonist in the Chinese cut, the US cut focuses more in IP man and cuts a lot out of her story
2015-11-18 22:37:34	Porkepik	keqin => Do you have a letterboxd ?
2015-11-18 22:37:37	RyanSmallwood	*Ip Man
2015-11-18 22:37:46	keqin	Porkepik nah why?
2015-11-18 22:37:55	Porkepik	just wondering, trying to find other people from irc on it
2015-11-18 22:37:56	yurikuma	really? i still felt like gong er was the protag but w.e
2015-11-18 22:38:22	RyanSmallwood	yeah, but more-so in the chinese cut, things are fleshed out better
2015-11-18 22:38:48	yurikuma	if only i could get my hand on the chinese cut
2015-11-18 22:38:52	yurikuma	prolly will have to pirate it
2015-11-18 22:39:10	RyanSmallwood	I wish he would release his cut
2015-11-18 22:39:22	RyanSmallwood	I liked the Chinese cut overall more, but there were good scenes in the US cut too
2015-11-18 22:39:46	yurikuma	he prolly wont release his   4 hour ver or w.e
2015-11-18 22:40:06	yurikuma	i read somewhere that he shot 20 hours of footage for in the mood for love and only used 1 hour 40mins lol
2015-11-18 22:40:14	RyanSmallwood	hahah pretty much
2015-11-18 22:41:20	RyanSmallwood	its frustrating that the scene in the US Cut with "The Razor" isn't in the Chinese cut, but its not that they dropped the character there's just a different "The Razor" scene in the Chinese cut
2015-11-18 22:41:28	RyanSmallwood	I want the cut with all the material he has on "The Razor"
2015-11-18 22:41:59	yurikuma	he only has like 1 scene if i remember right
2015-11-18 22:42:09	RyanSmallwood	yeah 1 scene in each cut
2015-11-18 22:42:09	yurikuma	does he have a bigger role in the chinese cut?
2015-11-18 22:42:15	RyanSmallwood	no just a different scene with him
2015-11-18 22:42:22	yurikuma	thats weird
2015-11-18 22:43:41	yurikuma	the razor character was interesting but seemed pretty pointless
2015-11-18 22:43:55	yurikuma	then again it was a kung fu movie disguised as a character drama so w.e

2015-11-18 22:56:31	Dema	Hey man
2015-11-18 22:56:31	yurikuma	haha well the post does give a good reason for it
2015-11-18 22:56:32	Dema	Fuck em
2015-11-18 22:56:43	indeedwatson	yeah, it was an interesting read
2015-11-18 22:56:47	indeedwatson	i just found it funny
2015-11-18 22:57:08	RyanSmallwood	what did I miss?
2015-11-18 22:57:21	yurikuma	not much
2015-11-18 22:57:53	indeedwatson	RyanSmallwood: i was commenting on the "fuck lionsgate" post
2015-11-18 22:57:55	indeedwatson	in r/movies
2015-11-18 22:58:03	RyanSmallwood	ahhhh
2015-11-18 22:58:12	RyanSmallwood	yeah I read that, that was funny and intestering
2015-11-18 23:01:19	yurikuma	this is pretty off topic but i always found it interesting that in the 60's and70's high profile mainstream directors would make horror movies
2015-11-18 23:01:31	yurikuma	like polanski with rosemarys baby or kubrick and the shining\\
2015-11-18 23:01:37	yurikuma	doesnt happen anymore
2015-11-18 23:03:27	indeedwatson	yeah
2015-11-18 23:03:35	indeedwatson	it's kinda sad
2015-11-18 23:04:12	yurikuma	well there is von trier but idk if he really counts as mainstream lol

2015-11-18 23:05:06	RyanSmallwood	I was gonna say Guillermo del Toro, but he started horror and hasn't been the most successful mainstream director so I dunno if he counts
2015-11-18 23:05:28	indeedwatson	both good examples
2015-11-18 23:05:36	indeedwatson	but they're different kinds of horror imo
2015-11-18 23:05:37	yurikuma	i suppose he counts in a way, i was more referring to just mainstream directors making atleast 1 horror movie
2015-11-18 23:05:53	yurikuma	so yeah he counts under that criteria
2015-11-18 23:06:11	yurikuma	oh gore verbinksi
2015-11-18 23:06:15	yurikuma	he did the ring remake right?
2015-11-18 23:06:52	RyanSmallwood	yes
2015-11-18 23:07:08	RyanSmallwood	Sam Raimi returned to horror after the Spidermans with Drag Me to Hell
2015-11-18 23:07:21	indeedwatson	is that worth watching?
2015-11-18 23:07:41	RyanSmallwood	I had fun in the theater, it kind of felt like evil dead-lite
2015-11-18 23:07:55	RyanSmallwood	I probably wouldn't got out of my way to see it again

2015-11-18 23:37:53	Card74	yurikuma: well, in the 70s the studios dabbled with sex to see whether it was something the audience wanted. Caligula, for example.
2015-11-18 23:38:30	Card74	I was astonished when I learned that from the making ofs

2015-11-18 23:48:14	Porkepik	I don't think i met one yet
2015-11-18 23:48:22	yurikuma	i would identify as one
2015-11-18 23:48:29	Porkepik	oh ok, interesting
2015-11-18 23:48:41	indeedwatson	really?

2015-11-18 23:48:45	Porkepik	Like, you can have sex ? Or really you don't want ?
2015-11-18 23:48:58	Porkepik	I mean, you have sex sometimes, but it doesn't really provide any pleasure ?
2015-11-18 23:48:58	yurikuma	i could but i have zero interest in it
2015-11-18 23:49:16	Porkepik	yeah the 'you can' is stupid, obviously you technicly can ^^

2015-11-18 23:49:40	indeedwatson	for moments i wish i was asexual lol
2015-11-18 23:50:00	Dema	Me too
2015-11-18 23:50:09	yurikuma	its basicly just lack of attraction and desire for sex
2015-11-18 23:50:15	yurikuma	i just dont care for it]
2015-11-18 23:50:18	Dema	Especially when I can't kick the 3 girls from last night out my bed /s

2015-11-18 23:51:21	Porkepik	Dema => dream is dead ? :(
2015-11-18 23:51:23	yurikuma	just the whole act of it
2015-11-18 23:51:32	Dema	Sex is gross as fuck.
2015-11-18 23:51:37	Dema	But so is fried food.
2015-11-18 23:51:42	Dema	Maybe I'm just gross.
2015-11-18 23:51:43	pmcinern	really, an ick factor.
2015-11-18 23:51:48	yurikuma	yeah but fried food tastes good
2015-11-18 23:51:58	Porkepik	I'm closer to a nymphomaniac haha
2015-11-18 23:52:00	yurikuma	imagine if you didnt taste anything
2015-11-18 23:52:00	Porkepik	complete opposite
2015-11-18 23:52:06	yurikuma	i suppose thats what its like for me
2015-11-18 23:52:42	yurikuma	you would just view eating food as a mechanical thing
2015-11-18 23:52:46	yurikuma	purely practical

2015-11-18 23:53:26	Porkepik	you want a SO at some point ?
2015-11-18 23:53:33	Porkepik	or no romantic desire ?

2015-11-18 23:55:22	indeedwatson	im pretty sure they do
2015-11-18 23:55:49	Porkepik	well, too bad, but i also kinda want to try something with a guy once
2015-11-18 23:55:56	Dema	Being married guarantees some sort of sex with usually pretty minimal effort. It's a lot better than the ball ache of finding a bum buddy.
2015-11-18 23:56:03	Porkepik	wouldn't mind a threesome MMF where i do stuff with the guy
2015-11-18 23:56:15	yurikuma	o.0 if u wanna go for it
2015-11-18 23:56:17	Porkepik	i also don't view sex as something in relation to love
2015-11-18 23:56:17	pmcinern	dema, it's just that the idea of having a fantastic, amazing experience twice a week is absurd.
2015-11-18 23:56:39	Porkepik	haha i know, i have very weird views in general
2015-11-18 23:57:05	pmcinern	you got kids, you're tired, you're stressed... you just want to go to bed, not worry about exploring the other person's body or something
2015-11-18 23:57:19	pmcinern	she just stunk up the bathroom
2015-11-18 23:57:20	Dema	True
2015-11-18 23:57:22	Porkepik	(i also have weird fetishes :3)
2015-11-18 23:57:24	indeedwatson	why are kids mandatory tho
2015-11-18 23:57:32	pmcinern	they're not, just another example
2015-11-18 23:57:34	Dema	But the whole marriage itself is a pretty amazing experience
2015-11-18 23:57:39	Dema	Sometimes
2015-11-18 23:57:51	pmcinern	true. forget marriage and kids though
2015-11-18 23:57:59	pmcinern	just being in a relationship with someone for five years
2015-11-18 23:58:04	Dema	Yeah. It loses its excitement.
2015-11-18 23:58:12	pmcinern	right
2015-11-18 23:58:18	Dema	I moved to England from the states for my wife
2015-11-18 23:58:26	yurikuma	thats why u gotta hook up with some1 who is hella smart and can hold a conversation
2015-11-18 23:58:28	Dema	And now I'm surrounded by all these accents
2015-11-18 23:58:32	yurikuma	cant ever get bored then
2015-11-18 23:58:41	zxc232	english accents are very cool
2015-11-18 23:58:42	pmcinern	yurikuma, ????
2015-11-18 23:58:49	Dema	And pretty faces. But it doesn't really matter
2015-11-18 23:59:03	Dema	Cause even if I was single to chase after em, I wouldn't be here.
2015-11-18 23:59:17	Dema	Plus I love my wife. But I hope that goes without saying.
2015-11-18 23:59:30	yurikuma	was answering demas statement about relationships losing excitement pmcinerm

2015-11-18 23:59:53	Dema	True yurikuma
2015-11-18 23:59:53	pmcinern	sorry
2015-11-19 00:00:08	yurikuma	lol what do i know though ive never had a girlfriend so w.e
2015-11-19 00:00:15	Dema	That's why I encourage traveling. Or pub crawls. Or sight seeing.
2015-11-19 00:00:35	Dema	Get somewhere new. Enjoy yourselves.
2015-11-19 00:01:10	Dema	And find comfort in the mundane.
2015-11-19 00:01:19	Dema	I like routines.
2015-11-19 00:01:48	pmcinern	i can totally understand being asexual, but from a different viewpoint. even if you're a lifelong bachelor, banging broads left and right, you'll realize that, at best, you're meeting a physical requirement that you could handle easier by yourself
2015-11-19 00:02:17	pmcinern	agree, Dema
2015-11-19 00:02:20	Dema	True that.
2015-11-19 00:02:23	indeedwatson	that is like comparing watching 2001 on your phone vs on a big screen
2015-11-19 00:02:44	Dema	Although. I can't felate myself.
2015-11-19 00:02:55	Dema	No matter how hard I try.
2015-11-19 00:03:07	yurikuma	oh lol just got what u meant
2015-11-19 00:03:10	pmcinern	Dema you got to stop that shit. it's ruining your life. you don't even go outside anymore
2015-11-19 00:03:11	yurikuma	took me a moment lol
2015-11-19 00:03:19	Dema	lol
2015-11-19 00:05:10	Dema	So I started reading I Am Legend
2015-11-19 00:05:10	yurikuma	one last thing about the assexual thing if u care
2015-11-19 00:05:20	Dema	Go ahead
2015-11-19 00:05:28	yurikuma	for me there are a million things i would rather be doing than having sex with someone
2015-11-19 00:05:36	yurikuma	its just so boring
2015-11-19 00:05:46	yurikuma	thats about it lol u can talk about i am legend
2015-11-19 00:06:11	Dema	Haha well the book is starting out great.
2015-11-19 00:06:19	indeedwatson	someone help me
2015-11-19 00:06:30	indeedwatson	im reading people say the shinning book is better than the movie
2015-11-19 00:06:35	Dema	But it reminds me more of The Omega Man with Heston than the Will Smith flick
2015-11-19 00:06:43	Dema	I've never read that.
2015-11-19 00:06:53	yurikuma	im assuming will smith took some creative liberties
2015-11-19 00:07:05	pmcinern	what do you need help with watson
2015-11-19 00:07:07	yurikuma	i would just read the book and decide for yourself
2015-11-19 00:07:11	yurikuma	if it really bothers u
2015-11-19 00:07:24	pmcinern	oh, lol
2015-11-19 00:07:25	indeedwatson	to stop reading that and not be angry lol
2015-11-19 00:07:33	pmcinern	right sorry
2015-11-19 00:07:33	yurikuma	pretty much yeah
2015-11-19 00:07:47	Dema	They're basically vampires in the book. Not crazy animalistic human things.
2015-11-19 00:08:13	yurikuma	well zombies were getting popular which is why they changed that i think
2015-11-19 00:08:22	pmcinern	whoever says the book is better than the movie, tell them that shirts are better than owls
2015-11-19 00:08:22	yurikuma	or maybe im full of shit idk
2015-11-19 00:08:22	Dema	And the protagonist is an alcoholic
2015-11-19 00:08:55	Dema	Who is actually battling his own sexual desires, as the vampire chicks show their goodies out his peephole
2015-11-19 00:09:09	yurikuma	HAHA seriously? that sounds amazing
2015-11-19 00:09:21	Dema	Seriously.
2015-11-19 00:09:48	Dema	The Omega Man is another version of the book and it seems a lot more faithful. But it's camp as fuck
2015-11-19 00:10:02	Dema	Movie version of the book I should say.
2015-11-19 00:10:39	yurikuma	well idk about the book but its a pretty silly premise so maybe camp is the way 2 go
2015-11-19 00:12:13	Dema	It's interesting so far. I did feel that I Am Legend was lacking in various aspects.
2015-11-19 00:12:18	Dema	Just as a story.
2015-11-19 00:12:34	yurikuma	i saw it along time ago so i cant really comment on that
2015-11-19 00:12:54	yurikuma	i just remember the effects being kinda bad on teh vampire/zombie/whatevers

2015-11-19 00:42:20	Dema	Yeah, they sing God Save The Queen instead of happy birthday
2015-11-19 00:42:52	Dema	I'm joking haha but I prefer pie over cake so that's different.
2015-11-19 00:42:54	Dema	And thanks.

2015-11-19 00:47:49	Dema	Well I said that and then realized I didn't add an /s
2015-11-19 00:47:57	Dema	And didn't wanna seem snarky.
2015-11-19 00:48:14	indeedwatson	im sarcastic a lot and rarely use /s
2015-11-19 00:49:04	pmcinern	hmmm, if you read that as if the "/s" was legit, then your sentence takes on a whole new meaning
2015-11-19 00:49:11	Dema	Sarcasm is England's second national language.
2015-11-19 00:49:37	Dema	Sometimes it's hard to tell if someone actually likes you or if they're just taking the mick.

2015-11-19 01:08:21	pmcinern	nice, i'm pretty new to it myself
2015-11-19 01:10:14	daggsta	i'm fairly new to film as well, can't really follow many discussions on the subreddit
2015-11-19 01:10:54	pmcinern	oh yeah? that's awesome. what are some of your favorite movies?
2015-11-19 01:11:51	daggsta	damn, that's a tough question
2015-11-19 01:13:21	daggsta	i'd say her, ex machina, taxi driver, and silence of the lambs, off the top of my head
2015-11-19 01:14:37	pmcinern	cool. what do you mean when you say you're new to film? are you studying it or just want to dig in deeper?

2015-11-19 01:16:45	daggsta	i can get some obvious stuff but not all of it until i look it up
2015-11-19 01:17:43	pmcinern	the thing that works for me is watching movies in groups. like, watch a bunch of spaghetti westerns, or a bunch of movies from one director, something like that
2015-11-19 01:17:56	pmcinern	you'll see the same things appear over and over, and it's much easier to pick up on them

2015-11-19 01:19:46	pmcinern	definitely
2015-11-19 01:19:58	yurikuma	strange suggestion but i would recommend  watching the plinkett star wars reviews
2015-11-19 01:20:13	yurikuma	i found them really helpful in understanding movies better
2015-11-19 01:20:55	pmcinern	i forgot who said it on the sub, but someone said watching a movie for the first time is like walking down a dark hall, and turning the lights on as you go through it. watching a movie a second time is like walking down the same hall, and now all the lights are on and you can see everything
2015-11-19 01:20:59	daggsta	cool, i'll do that too
2015-11-19 01:21:23	daggsta	dang well articulated
2015-11-19 01:21:57	pmcinern	who are some of your favorite directors?
2015-11-19 01:22:42	daggsta	martin scorcese, quentin tarantino, wes anderson
2015-11-19 01:22:59	daggsta	maybe joel and ethan coen
2015-11-19 01:23:59	pmcinern	cool. i'd suggest looking at the influences of those guys
2015-11-19 01:24:50	daggsta	oh thats a good idea, haven't thought of that
2015-11-19 01:24:51	pmcinern	Wes Anderson = Max Ophuls, Scorsese = de Sica, Tarantino = Fuller/King Hu/Eeeeveryone
2015-11-19 01:25:52	yurikuma	ha yeah for tarantino he basicly just steals from everything so he doesnt really have a singular influence
2015-11-19 01:25:53	daggsta	i haven't heard of any of those people unfortunately
2015-11-19 01:26:27	pmcinern	not unfortunate at all.
2015-11-19 01:27:04	daggsta	what exactly is "stolen" from directors
2015-11-19 01:27:10	daggsta	style?
2015-11-19 01:27:34	yurikuma	i was more referring to the fact the he just straight up lifts shots from other movies like in kill bill
2015-11-19 01:27:41	pmcinern	so, he lifts music from his favorite movies
2015-11-19 01:27:44	yurikuma	dont get me wrong i dont think its a bad thing\
2015-11-19 01:27:58	yurikuma	"a good artist borrows, a great artist steals" lol
2015-11-19 01:28:02	pmcinern	his stories are takes on other genre movies
2015-11-19 01:28:27	daggsta	ah, i didn't realize that
2015-11-19 01:28:51	pmcinern	yurikuma's right. he's like the greatest collage director ever
2015-11-19 01:29:23	Card74	Tarantino is excellent at "remixing" old ideas / stories / scenes etc and making them work
2015-11-19 01:29:39	pmcinern	well put
2015-11-19 01:29:41	indeedwatson	i still think jackie brown is his best

2015-11-19 11:15:58	Schultard	He's got a very unique aesthetic
2015-11-19 11:16:32	Schultard	Very few films resemble any of his recent work. Think he was awarded the Golden Lion last year (might've been this year)
2015-11-19 11:16:35	@Carson	which of his films are your favorite?
2015-11-19 11:18:22	Schultard	I've only actually seen one of his. But I hear one of his first is good, "En kärlekshistoria" (A Swedish Love Story).
2015-11-19 11:19:16	Schultard	I saw "Songs From the Second Floor".
2015-11-19 11:20:07	Schultard	Everything is static. There's not a frame in the film where the camera moves.
2015-11-19 11:20:12	Schultard	And the
2015-11-19 11:20:21	Schultard	scenes are all in one take.
2015-11-19 11:26:13	@Carson	I'll probably try to watch some of his films eventually
2015-11-19 11:26:30	@Carson	I saw Gasper Noes film Love yesterday

2015-11-20 23:06:07	RyanSmallwood	ahh, I only hear about them in context of the French New Wave, I know they're still active, but I didn't know how well regarded they were these days
2015-11-20 23:06:17	Porkepik	not too much haha
2015-11-20 23:06:20	Porkepik	but still interesting

2015-11-20 23:18:44	RyanSmallwood	I want to get into all those fancy board games that people really into game design like
2015-11-20 23:18:54	tomflint	once you have three of one, leverage good debt by mortgaging your other properties, then investing that money into houses -- never hotels.
2015-11-20 23:19:02	Card74	Monopoly is a bit dull... the first one to buy those two expensive apartments wins.
2015-11-20 23:19:14	tomflint	you should have about three laps around by the time you have three of one property.
2015-11-20 23:19:24	tomflint	the first person to land on your property will go bankrupt...
2015-11-20 23:19:48	pchaps	Card74: I just remember specific moments where Blunt's dialogue sounded muddy and too distant in the mix. I liked the foley in the tunnels.

2015-11-20 23:34:58	pchaps	It all starts with writing and ends with technical execution. A good concept rarely promises anything.

2015-11-20 23:46:25	pchaps	So I just watched The Great Dictator for the first time in a few years. The speech in the end is magnificent
2015-11-20 23:46:58	pchaps	I wonder if slapstick humor can ever exist again after that era
2015-11-20 23:47:26	tomflint	its amazing, eh
2015-11-20 23:47:55	tomflint	we still have slapstick in a sense --
2015-11-20 23:48:24	pchaps	I see it in Tim and Eric's stuff, but it doesn't seem to be a staple of contemporary comedy
2015-11-20 23:48:41	tomflint	Melissa McCarthy does slapstick in a lot of ways -- but its not the same as the 40s and such
2015-11-20 23:48:58	pchaps	True
2015-11-20 23:49:18	pchaps	I'd like to see McCarthy in a more dramatic role

2015-11-21 00:46:37	pmcinern	Thanks again for that link to the documentary... i started watching it and had to put it down before it sucked up my night
2015-11-21 00:47:33	tomflint	This podcast is decent
2015-11-21 00:47:35	RyanSmallwood	hah, yeah its pretty great, I almost started rewatching after posting it
2015-11-21 00:48:11	RyanSmallwood	I noticed after posting the playlist had some errors, at some point the eppisodes are out of order and it seems to be missing 1 episode, not sure if that episode is somewhere else on youtube
2015-11-21 00:49:07	pmcinern	i'm sure it is
2015-11-21 00:50:28	RyanSmallwood	I like documentaries like that because then you can kind of see where the films fit in their historical context without having to watch 100 films first

2015-11-21 01:26:24	RyanSmallwood	pmcinern: back onto HK comedy, Hui Brothers are the big comedy team in the 1970s, they worked with Sammo Hung and John Woo too,  and John Woo was also known for his comedies before he did gun fu stuff
2015-11-21 01:26:54	pmcinern	did not know that about Woo. Sounds great.
2015-11-21 01:27:20	pmcinern	Actually, that sounds great for another reason: "art house" was just a blanket term i was using for "non action"
2015-11-21 01:27:26	pmcinern	which is ridiculous
2015-11-21 01:27:47	RyanSmallwood	heh
2015-11-21 01:28:41	RyanSmallwood	most HK comedies have some kind of action in them, they're just focused more on gags than fighting
2015-11-21 01:29:17	pmcinern	but yeah that's perfect. let's see... i'd say, what, two more weekends after this of wuxia, another month for kung fu, maybe 3 weeks for gun fu, 4 for "art house" and then whatever we come up with for comedy?
2015-11-21 01:29:46	pmcinern	hong kong will never end...
2015-11-21 01:29:51	RyanSmallwood	heh, that's a lot of weeks for each topic
2015-11-21 01:30:05	RyanSmallwood	I could squeeze comedy into 1 week, but I certainly know enough stuff for 3 or more
2015-11-21 01:30:53	pmcinern	5 movies a week is about as much as i could do. anything more, and it would start turning into a list of movies that ppl wouldn't get the chance to see but one or two of
2015-11-21 01:31:05	pmcinern	if we could screen them during the week, that would be a different story
2015-11-21 01:31:38	pmcinern	but yeah, let's just work on getting a list together, and however long it takes is however long it takes

2015-11-21 01:37:37	pmcinern	If we can get the movies and write ups together in time (which we have plenty of), it may even be a better idea to just do it after the gun fu, as a transition to non-action
2015-11-21 01:38:57	RyanSmallwood	sure, I've got a lot of stuff already in mind

2015-11-21 01:41:17	pmcinern	nice. anything in particular you're fond of that i should be watching to acquaint myself with?
2015-11-21 01:41:20	@Carson	btw I have an account with surrealmoviez, but I never really used it much, and haven't heard of many others using it
2015-11-21 01:43:34	RyanSmallwood	pmcinern: The Hui Brothers film The Private Eyes is the big breakthrough in HK comedy, The God of Cookery is my favorite 90s Stepehn Chow by far
2015-11-21 01:43:41	pmcinern	what does it specialize in?
2015-11-21 01:43:45	pmcinern	oh awesome, on it
2015-11-21 01:44:20	pmcinern	YES!! i guessed right! god of cookery was going to be an "art house" one.
2015-11-21 01:44:45	@Carson	The Surrealmoviez community preserves and makes available cinematic treasures by indexing sources stored elsewhere on the web. The focus is away from the mainstream, leaning heavily towards experimental, surreal, independent, artistic, extreme cinema...
2015-11-21 01:45:29	pmcinern	NOTICE: 15 MINUTES TILL SCREENINGS BEGIN
2015-11-21 01:45:38	@Carson	tonight?
2015-11-21 01:45:50	pmcinern	yep. friday at midnight
2015-11-21 01:46:05	@Carson	nice
2015-11-21 01:46:17	pmcinern	so have you ever found it useful? you say there's not a lot of ppl on there...
2015-11-21 01:46:34	@Carson	well not sure, I'll give it a try again
2015-11-21 01:46:45	@Carson	it's not through torrents
2015-11-21 01:46:50	pmcinern	huh
2015-11-21 01:47:23	@Carson	so it can be difficult to download because it's all direct downloads from upload services
2015-11-21 01:47:37	@Carson	majority of the stuff I haven't heard of
2015-11-21 01:47:45	@Carson	so it's like where do I go
2015-11-21 01:47:52	pmcinern	oooooh i see. wow.
2015-11-21 01:47:57	@Carson	and there isn't a top viewed films list
2015-11-21 01:48:42	pmcinern	huh, well i guess that's actually kind of perfect for a hidden gem kind of website
2015-11-21 01:48:48	@Carson	oh you can do most viewed hmm
2015-11-21 01:52:44	pmcinern	hey quick hypethetical question
2015-11-21 01:52:49	@Carson	yeah
2015-11-21 01:53:03	pmcinern	would a vpn prevent a private tracker from knowing your ratio?
2015-11-21 01:53:21	@Carson	I have no idea, others should know
2015-11-21 01:53:37	pmcinern	others! what's the word!
2015-11-21 01:53:59	@Carson	i assume no,
2015-11-21 01:55:05	RyanSmallwood	I'm not usre
2015-11-21 01:55:08	RyanSmallwood	*sure
2015-11-21 01:55:28	RyanSmallwood	I don't think so though
2015-11-21 01:55:46	pmcinern	just want to do this right. i'd be using utorrent, with a vpn... pretty standard fare, i assume
2015-11-21 01:56:51	@Carson	woah I'm actually finding some good stuff on SM now
2015-11-21 01:57:04	@Carson	just found a Steve Reich doc
2015-11-21 02:00:25	RyanSmallwood	not sure how that works
2015-11-21 02:00:30	RyanSmallwood	anyways, I gotta go now
2015-11-21 02:00:39	RyanSmallwood	I'll be at some of the screening tomorrow
2015-11-21 02:00:39	@Carson	cya
2015-11-21 02:00:43	pmcinern	adios

2015-11-21 10:51:15	AlexJ44	is it that good?
2015-11-21 10:51:54	keqin	i think what is appealing about the assassin is that it goes for trying to operate on a different metric
2015-11-21 10:52:06	keqin	that's why there's all the confusion about if it's 'good' or not

2015-11-21 10:53:03	RyanSmallwood	awww, I missed The Assassin talk?
2015-11-21 10:53:15	keqin	just got started
2015-11-21 10:53:21	keqin	just mentioned that theres another thread about it
2015-11-21 10:53:26	keqin	and that i was gonna see it again
2015-11-21 10:53:47	keqin	and i was saying how its trying to 'work on a different metric', thus there's 'confusion about if it's good or not'
2015-11-21 10:55:27	keqin	RyanSmallwood have u seen his prev movies?
2015-11-21 10:55:46	RyanSmallwood	a few of them, like A Time to Live and A TIme to Die

2015-11-21 10:56:39	keqin	city of sadness blew me away tho
2015-11-21 10:56:57	RyanSmallwood	I've seen that one as well
2015-11-21 10:58:21	keqin	i liked how in the TF letterboxd list, it was the alternative to the godfather
2015-11-21 10:58:27	keqin	great comparison
2015-11-21 11:03:35	RyanSmallwood	I really need to start making video essays, I didn't realize there was such a demand from people who just saw the newest arthouse hit looking for explanations of why its well regarded
2015-11-21 11:07:10	keqin	ive been thinking about it too, but i think i first need to develop my analysis
2015-11-21 11:07:38	keqin	it seems fun
2015-11-21 11:08:19	keqin	you should do it though, id watch them
2015-11-21 11:09:23	RyanSmallwood	I've got a few I'm thinking about putting together soon, just gotta set aside a chunk of time to rip the clips and write the scripts
2015-11-21 11:10:29	keqin	whens tony zhou's new vid coming out?
2015-11-21 11:11:06	RyanSmallwood	yeah yeesh, its been 2 months or so?
2015-11-21 11:11:18	RyanSmallwood	hopefully that means he's working on something big and not getting sidetracked by other stuff
2015-11-21 11:11:41	indeedwatson	he never does long videos tho
2015-11-21 11:12:44	RyanSmallwood	long videos is really tough to make entertaining, you've gotta rip tons and tons of clips
2015-11-21 11:13:12	RyanSmallwood	though I think youtubeRed is shifting the economics of videos so long videos are more profitable, whereas it used to be short videos were more profitable, so we may see more long form analysis
2015-11-21 11:15:12	indeedwatson	well YMS has been making long videos for a while cause he didn't care about profitable as much as making them how he thought they should be
2015-11-21 11:16:13	RyanSmallwood	yeah, there's some long format stuff too, like the red letter media star wars prequel reviews
2015-11-21 11:17:09	indeedwatson	RLM rarely makes videos shorter than 30mins
2015-11-21 11:17:36	indeedwatson	they haven't released anything in a while cause they're finishing up their movie
2015-11-21 11:18:46	RyanSmallwood	oh, they did a movie?
2015-11-21 11:19:35	indeedwatson	they've done a few
2015-11-21 11:19:41	indeedwatson	low budget of course
2015-11-21 11:20:04	indeedwatson	they've participated in that 48 hour film festival
2015-11-21 11:20:16	RyanSmallwood	that makes sense, considering how big a role skits play in their reviews
2015-11-21 11:20:36	indeedwatson	and the last they made is a movie called feeding frenzy
2015-11-21 11:21:03	indeedwatson	the one they're about to release is called space cop
2015-11-21 11:24:10	RyanSmallwood	just watched the feeding frenzy trailer, looks pretty funny
2015-11-21 11:24:51	indeedwatson	it's got some dull moments but it's enjoyable if you like their style
2015-11-21 11:25:25	indeedwatson	and if you're into b movies
2015-11-21 11:25:45	indeedwatson	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO8cv1V9RQQ
2015-11-21 11:25:50	RyanSmallwood	their sketches are kind of hit or miss with me, they've got a lot of funny ideas, but not everything lands
2015-11-21 11:27:30	indeedwatson	yeah i watch them cause i like the guys mostly
2015-11-21 11:27:43	indeedwatson	even tho lately i disagree a lot with their half in the bag reviews
2015-11-21 11:29:26	RyanSmallwood	yeah, I don't watch half in the bag regularly, just some movies I'm curious to hear their take
2015-11-21 11:29:47	RyanSmallwood	hopefully they'll do more stuff as good as the star wars prequel reviews again
2015-11-21 11:32:50	indeedwatson	in terms of analysis, im not sure, they haven't done plinket in years
2015-11-21 11:40:03	keqin	hey do u guys have any recommendations for readings on film critical theory and stuff like that
2015-11-21 11:40:27	keqin	stuff ud find in film courses
2015-11-21 11:40:47	RyanSmallwood	I guess depends exactly what you mean by critical theory
2015-11-21 11:41:29	RyanSmallwood	there's like cultural theory stuff based on generating political "readings of films"
2015-11-21 11:41:37	RyanSmallwood	and then there's practical narrative stuff like what Bordwell writes
2015-11-21 11:42:33	keqin	i like bordwell, but i cant seem to find anybody else who does formalist writing like him
2015-11-21 11:43:08	RyanSmallwood	the extreme version of Bordwell is Barry Salt
2015-11-21 11:43:48	RyanSmallwood	he can be annoying sometimes at the way he dismisses all other analysis than his own, but his viewpoint is very valuable
2015-11-21 11:45:24	keqin	ill check him out. id like to have some better understanding of marxist film theory
2015-11-21 11:46:14	keqin	i guess i dont have a good grasp on all the different branches there are and if theyre outdated or w/e
2015-11-21 11:46:32	RyanSmallwood	The big introductory textbook is
2015-11-21 11:46:32	RyanSmallwood	Film Theory and Criticism
2015-11-21 11:47:15	RyanSmallwood	that's got a huge mix of ideas starting with Eisenstein, and moving through Bazin and the cahier critics, marxist criticism, feminist criticism, and also has formalist stuff like Bordwell too
2015-11-21 11:47:46	keqin	oh dude this guy did cinemetrics lol
2015-11-21 11:48:06	RyanSmallwood	The big assault on theory based film analysis is the Bordwell edited "Post-Theory: Reconstructing Film Studies"
2015-11-21 11:48:30	RyanSmallwood	which has a bunch of essays by different authors offering alternatives to theory based criticism
2015-11-21 11:49:15	keqin	cool
2015-11-21 11:51:53	RyanSmallwood	Barry Salt's "Film Style and Technology: History and Analysis" is very valuable for learning how all the technological developments in film equipment effect film aesthetics, even if you have to put up with a little of his ranting how no one else does film analysis right and even Bordwell is  just doing a sloppy less rigorous version of his kind of
2015-11-21 11:51:53	RyanSmallwood	analysis

2015-11-21 11:55:56	keqin	so if bordwell dominates the scene, are there people still trying to develop the theory side?
2015-11-21 11:59:24	RyanSmallwood	I guess this is where it gets a little complicated, and this is an area I'm still looking into myself

2015-11-21 11:59:54	RyanSmallwood	there's definitely people still working on the theory side, but I also see a lot of things kind of commenting on theory "ending"
2015-11-21 12:00:17	RyanSmallwood	someone like Slavoj Žižek  is definitely doing theory type analysis
2015-11-21 12:00:36	RyanSmallwood	I think the whole theory vs non-theory story is more how people like Bordwell see things
2015-11-21 12:01:12	RyanSmallwood	I don't think the theory people see it as one way vs the other way, and most of them have incorporated some of Bordwell's ideas and criticisms, without necessarily dropping what they learned from theory
2015-11-21 12:01:47	keqin	interesting
2015-11-21 12:02:56	keqin	from what i understand, zizek thinks that bordwell doesnt see just how much the ideology in a movie affects a viewer
2015-11-21 12:05:52	RyanSmallwood	its tricky to get a dialogue between the two sides, often they seem to be talking past each other because of their different assumptions
2015-11-21 12:06:19	RyanSmallwood	I come more from the Bordwell camp, but I'm open minded about learning from the theory stuff, so I'm trying to learn about it and see what useful stuff I can find
2015-11-21 12:07:04	RyanSmallwood	it also kind of corresponds to the Analytic vs Continental debate in Philosophy
2015-11-21 12:09:07	keqin	hm yeah - i actually prefer the analytic philosophy like wittgenstein... to me the continental stuff can get a little bogged down
2015-11-21 12:09:38	RyanSmallwood	yeah, Wittgenstein and  J.L Austin are my main philosophical influences
2015-11-21 12:09:44	keqin	marx counts as continental though right?
2015-11-21 12:09:49	RyanSmallwood	yup
2015-11-21 12:10:14	keqin	ive only read the first chapter of das kapital but i thought his stuff was pretty 'analytical'
2015-11-21 12:10:34	keqin	well maybe thats not the right term
2015-11-21 12:10:50	keqin	i felt like it really broke down capitalism for me
2015-11-21 12:11:05	RyanSmallwood	some people argue that the analytical vs continental divide is exaggerated and stems mostly from the two sides not reading enough of each other but going based on impressions
2015-11-21 12:11:12	keqin	ok
2015-11-21 12:11:36	RyanSmallwood	its better to judge a writer's arguments on their own, and not get too bogged down on if they're "analytical" or "continental" just do they make persuasive arguments
2015-11-21 12:12:02	keqin	what do u make of wittgenstein's attitude toward movies? its been said that he was really interested in film, but he never explicitly wrote anything about it
2015-11-21 12:12:34	RyanSmallwood	I've heard about it, but I haven't looked into it too deeply myself yet
2015-11-21 12:12:42	keqin	alright
2015-11-21 12:12:54	RyanSmallwood	Stanley Cavell is a philosopher who wrote on Wittgenstein and wrote a lot of books on film
2015-11-21 12:13:01	RyanSmallwood	I haven't read too much of his stuff yet
2015-11-21 12:14:59	keqin	have u seen wittgenstein by derek jarman?
2015-11-21 12:15:22	RyanSmallwood	nope
2015-11-21 12:17:19	keqin	i thought it was pretty good, but its nothing like any movie ive seen... its kinda like a documentary about his life presented using his philosophies so it kinda isnt a documentary
2015-11-21 12:17:54	RyanSmallwood	interesting, I'll have to check it out

2015-11-21 12:26:40	RyanSmallwood	There's one angle I'm currently investigating on the whole analytic vs continental divide
2015-11-21 12:27:23	RyanSmallwood	which says that if you look at some of these thinkers in their original context they didn't intend for their theories to apply to philosophy, literary criticism or film criticism
2015-11-21 12:28:14	keqin	like, they were just letters to friends or something?
2015-11-21 12:28:22	RyanSmallwood	so like Marx thought he was an economist, and even though he drew on Hegelian philosophy he also drew on economists like Ricardo, Freud and Lacan were doing Psychoanalysis, Claude Lévi-Strauss was doing anthropology
2015-11-21 12:28:34	keqin	ah i see
2015-11-21 12:28:59	RyanSmallwood	so some people think the divide came when American universities started appropriating their ideas for philosophy, literary and film analysis
2015-11-21 12:29:33	RyanSmallwood	the philosophers in American universities, saw how it was being applied in the arts, and assumed the original thinkers were like that and labeled them as "continental philosophy"
2015-11-21 12:29:46	RyanSmallwood	I'm currently reading a book called  "French Theory: How Foucault, Derrida, Deleuze, & Co. Transformed the Intellectual Life of the United States"
2015-11-21 12:30:37	RyanSmallwood	which is written by a French writer, who thinks that if you read these thinkers in their original context, they make sense, but the way the way American universities have treated them like religious texts and used them for analysis, is where they go wrong

2015-11-21 12:33:08	keqin	so you dont think the original writers would have intended for their methods to be used for anything other than their immediate concerns, like dreams for freud or economy for marx
2015-11-21 12:34:40	RyanSmallwood	yeah marx didn't think a bunch of American university students writing dense movie analysis and mixing his ideas with freud was going to overthrow the capitalist system and start a communist revolution
2015-11-21 12:35:06	keqin	yeah he must feel demoted
2015-11-21 12:37:06	keqin	well that is really interesting, though we can talk all we want about how these films are (probably negatively) shaping our ideologies all we want, does it affect any real change to the system?
2015-11-21 12:38:15	keqin	is film even a good vehicle for this kind of stuff?
2015-11-21 12:38:44	RyanSmallwood	yeah, that's Bordwell's argument, that kind of writing is good for publishing tons and tons of books of "readings", but not necessarily changing anything
2015-11-21 12:42:46	keqin	id like to read this argument
2015-11-21 12:48:40	RyanSmallwood	He's got an essay critiquing Žižek on his blog http://www.davidbordwell.net/essays/zizek.php

2015-11-21 12:48:57	RyanSmallwood	His other big essay is Contemporary Film Studies and the Vicissitudes of Grand Theory  which is in the beginning of  Post-Theory
2015-11-21 12:49:19	RyanSmallwood	a lot of his books have some kind of variation on his argument in the beginnning

2015-11-21 20:11:34	RyanSmallwood	thoughts?
2015-11-21 20:12:47	Card74	a bit avant garde for my taste... looked gorgeous, of course
2015-11-21 20:13:05	RyanSmallwood	yeah
2015-11-21 20:14:19	RyanSmallwood	I liked aspects of it, I'm not sure the film as a whole resonated with me, particularly the scenes with Sean Penn felt out of place
2015-11-21 20:15:35	Card74	yeah. IMDb says there was enough footage of Penn to create an entire film
2015-11-21 20:16:02	RyanSmallwood	heh, yeah I heard he filmed tons of footage
2015-11-21 20:16:17	RyanSmallwood	I think Sean Penn was angry or something cause barely any of his performance was on screen
2015-11-21 20:17:36	Card74	...and that the film doesn't resemble the script, which he thought was the best he'd ever read
2015-11-21 20:18:03	RyanSmallwood	heh

2015-11-21 21:59:12	RyanSmallwood	heh, El Topo probably
2015-11-21 21:59:31	RyanSmallwood	Holy Mountain has his craziest visuals, but I think its better to build up to that one
2015-11-21 22:00:06	RyanSmallwood	it doesn't matter too too much
2015-11-21 22:00:41	RyanSmallwood	I think El Topo, Holy Mountain, and Santa Sangre as his 3 best, Santa Sangre is my favorite overall
2015-11-21 22:02:44	indeedwatson	oh well it's mkv
2015-11-21 22:02:49	gallusgallus	from what I know, his stuff is definitely up my alley.

2015-11-21 22:17:18	RyanSmallwood	I've wanted to for a while cause Nicolas Roeg is the cinematographer
2015-11-21 22:17:27	RyanSmallwood	I've seen other of the Corman Poe films
2015-11-21 22:18:28	gallusgallus	I've seen that one and House of usher

2015-11-21 22:21:46	muskrat	ok :) btw, the song living dead by entombed contains a sample from that movie, which is why i looked it up originally
2015-11-21 22:22:26	muskrat	there are a lot of horror movie samples in metal songs, i guess. not really surprising
2015-11-21 22:23:06	RyanSmallwood	heh, that was part of the fun of watching more horror movies, suddenly realizing where all those metal song samples came from
2015-11-21 22:23:58	indeedwatson	there's a rap song that uses a track from psycho

2015-11-21 23:40:38	indeedwatson	there's a really janky weird cut in blade runner
2015-11-21 23:41:03	indeedwatson	anyone know what im talking about?
2015-11-21 23:43:26	RyanSmallwood	not off the top of my head
2015-11-21 23:43:42	Card74	which version?
2015-11-21 23:44:22	indeedwatson	when deckard is fighint against the replicant from the beginning of the movie, he pulls out his gun and the replicant hits it away
2015-11-21 23:44:32	indeedwatson	Card74: final cut
2015-11-21 23:44:40	indeedwatson	maybe it's a problem with my file
2015-11-21 23:47:25	Card74	Now where's my viewing copy of BR..?
2015-11-21 23:52:46	Porkepik	never watched it
2015-11-21 23:53:03	Porkepik	not really tempted tho ...
2015-11-21 23:54:42	Card74	Oh, found it. I accidentally ordered 2 BR cases and decided to keep the other one unopened.
2015-11-21 23:54:59	indeedwatson	haha
2015-11-21 23:56:00	indeedwatson	why not Porkepik 
2015-11-21 23:56:12	Porkepik	well, i'm sure i would enjoy it
2015-11-21 23:56:24	Porkepik	but i have so many classic movies in my watchlist
2015-11-21 23:56:50	Porkepik	like citizen kane, tarr's movies, Jodorowsky etc ...
2015-11-21 23:56:59	Card74	BR is a classic!
2015-11-21 23:57:13	Porkepik	Yeah, but not my priority right now
2015-11-21 23:59:50	RyanSmallwood	do the tarr
2015-11-22 00:00:47	Porkepik	i will, i will :P
2015-11-22 00:01:20	indeedwatson	sounds like a dance
2015-11-22 00:01:25	indeedwatson	get on your feet and do the tarr!
2015-11-22 00:01:33	RyanSmallwood	its the Satantango
2015-11-22 00:02:25	Porkepik	while listening to some Werckmeister Harmonies
2015-11-22 00:02:31	Porkepik	(sorry i tried)
2015-11-22 00:02:36	Porkepik	(but i'm bad at those :( )
2015-11-22 00:02:47	RyanSmallwood	with a man from london
2015-11-22 00:03:01	RyanSmallwood	(shhh just keep it going)
2015-11-22 00:03:54	Porkepik	Who just left the family nest ?
2015-11-22 00:04:10	Porkepik	he was more of an outsider anyway
2015-11-22 00:04:28	RyanSmallwood	if we keep this going, we're going to face Damnation
2015-11-22 00:06:03	RyanSmallwood	but back on topic: tarr makes the best movies
2015-11-22 00:06:32	Porkepik	Yeah, i'm going to watch them in the upcoming days i guess
2015-11-22 00:06:45	Card74	Weird, it looks like there's a frame missing
2015-11-22 00:07:28	RyanSmallwood	Porkepik: have you seen any bergman or tarkovsky?
2015-11-22 00:08:22	Porkepik	no, but i have fanny and alexander and solaris in my watchlist to remind myself to watch them
2015-11-22 00:08:49	Porkepik	actually i don't have fanny and alexander, forgot to add it
2015-11-22 00:09:07	Porkepik	oh no i have them
2015-11-22 00:09:12	RyanSmallwood	you may want to warm up on them before you got full Tarr
2015-11-22 00:09:24	Porkepik	ok i was confused, the poster on letterboxd are weird
2015-11-22 00:09:39	Porkepik	ok thanks, will do that then
2015-11-22 00:10:11	yurikuma	i wish i understood what people see in tarr
2015-11-22 00:10:18	RyanSmallwood	everything wonderful
2015-11-22 00:10:33	Porkepik	he died in france
2015-11-22 00:10:35	yurikuma	granted ive only seen satantango so idk about his other movies
2015-11-22 00:10:39	Porkepik	tarkovsky
2015-11-22 00:11:05	RyanSmallwood	yurikuma: Satantango is similar to the other stuff of his I've seen
2015-11-22 00:11:16	Porkepik	wut he might have been killed by the KGB
2015-11-22 00:14:31	yurikuma	im curious what you guys like about bela tarr cuz i found satantango to be really boring
2015-11-22 00:14:43	yurikuma	it was like tarkovsky played in super slow motion
2015-11-22 00:15:49	RyanSmallwood	I don't find slow stuff boring
2015-11-22 00:15:55	RyanSmallwood	just if nothing interesting is happening
2015-11-22 00:16:02	RyanSmallwood	Tarr things just unfold very slowly
2015-11-22 00:16:29	yurikuma	its not that its slow that makes it boring
2015-11-22 00:16:54	yurikuma	he focused on super mundane things for absurd amounts of time
2015-11-22 00:17:14	yurikuma	and almost every shot goes on waaaaaay 2 long
2015-11-22 00:17:26	RyanSmallwood	heh, I love his wicked sense of humor though
2015-11-22 00:17:31	RyanSmallwood	like after the dance
2015-11-22 00:17:38	RyanSmallwood	the guy wakes up and starts finishing everyone's beer
2015-11-22 00:17:38	yurikuma	its weird though cuz some the shots work like the 2 opening shots
2015-11-22 00:17:53	RyanSmallwood	and its like yup, we're gonna watch him walk around and finish every single beer
2015-11-22 00:17:59	RyanSmallwood	and then he walks off screen and vomits
2015-11-22 00:18:11	yurikuma	i dont remember that lol
2015-11-22 00:18:14	RyanSmallwood	classic Tarr comedy
2015-11-22 00:18:22	yurikuma	although i did fall asleep twice during the movie
2015-11-22 00:18:26	yurikuma	:/
2015-11-22 00:18:28	Porkepik	Do i have to watch Satantango in one day tho ? ^^
2015-11-22 00:18:49	yurikuma	bela tarr expressed his wish taht people see satantango in one sitting
2015-11-22 00:18:49	Porkepik	i could do it in 2 days, watching one half and then the other one
2015-11-22 00:18:57	Porkepik	oh i see
2015-11-22 00:18:59	yurikuma	i would say go for it if you got the time and patience
2015-11-22 00:19:12	Porkepik	well that makes sense, to stay in the story, to experience it in one siting
2015-11-22 00:19:38	yurikuma	idk just 2 summarize i think theres a good 2 hours movie somewhere in satantango
2015-11-22 00:19:50	yurikuma	its just filled with lots of pointless and overlong sequences imo
2015-11-22 00:20:07	yurikuma	although maybe thats the point of the movie
2015-11-22 00:20:31	Porkepik	i may not watch Satantango right away
2015-11-22 00:20:40	Porkepik	Cause i want my first watch to be in one sitting
2015-11-22 00:20:51	Porkepik	but i don't have the time at the moment
2015-11-22 00:21:05	Porkepik	i will watch his other movies before
2015-11-22 00:21:07	RyanSmallwood	I dunno, I found once I was committed to sitting down for a 7 hour movie I was in the right mindset for the pacing
2015-11-22 00:21:11	RyanSmallwood	I've seen it twice now
2015-11-22 00:21:38	RyanSmallwood	Porkepik: see Werckmeister Harmonies
2015-11-22 00:21:49	Porkepik	yeah on top of my watchlist
2015-11-22 00:25:56	Porkepik	well going to bed

2015-11-22 10:41:02	RyanSmallwood	Porkepikk: that date sounds about right when that information was coming out
2015-11-22 10:41:36	RyanSmallwood	Cecile Tang Shu Shuen said she was pro Mao initially, but then noticed all the people fleeing mainland China to HK
2015-11-22 10:41:44	RyanSmallwood	and after interviewing several of them she made China Behind in 1974
2015-11-22 10:42:24	keqin	wow havent even heard of her - will add to list

2015-11-22 10:44:34	RyanSmallwood	I think pmcinern is planning on showing one of her films eventually
2015-11-22 10:44:46	RyanSmallwood	I dunno if he'll show The Arch instead or show both films
2015-11-22 10:44:58	keqin	damn pierre ryckmans did some good work in asia
2015-11-22 10:45:34	RyanSmallwood	I can always do a cytube screening if there's interest
2015-11-22 10:45:52	keqin	i would be down if we can arrange a suitable time
2015-11-22 10:46:25	keqin	um but thats interesting that even godard had access to mao before ryckman's works
2015-11-22 10:46:45	keqin	and why is france sympathetic to the chinese, seemingly moreso than other countries
2015-11-22 10:46:50	RyanSmallwood	wasn't he pro-Mao though?
2015-11-22 10:46:52	keqin	or maybe im just cherrypicking evidence
2015-11-22 10:46:59	keqin	ryckman is also pro-mao
2015-11-22 10:47:06	keqin	oh wait
2015-11-22 10:47:20	keqin	so ryckman is pro-mao
2015-11-22 10:47:40	keqin	and godard portrayed characters who were revolutionaries/ sympathetic to mao
2015-11-22 10:47:47	keqin	though he wasnt necesarily in the same thinking

2015-11-22 10:48:27	keqin	in the description though: "As a result, he became sympathetic to the Maoist regime:[5] "I confidently extended to the Maoist regime the same sympathy that I felt for all things Chinese."[6] He returned from the trip with also the firm view that "it would be inconceivable to live in this world, in our age, without a good knowledge of Chinese langua

2015-11-22 10:51:29	RyanSmallwood	I think there were a lot of French Intellectuals were communist and looking for a communist government they could support

2015-11-22 10:52:43	RyanSmallwood	I know the Frankfurt School in Germany/US was also communist, I don't know how much they were interested in China, but I think they would've had to have been at some point

2015-11-22 10:53:17	keqin	just cuz of the alliteration
2015-11-22 10:54:31	RyanSmallwood	I remember Tony Zhou made a tweet that he was pissed off at Godard for quoting Mao in Adieu au langage
2015-11-22 10:54:48	RyanSmallwood	I dunno how much Mao plays into Godard today

2015-11-22 10:56:37	RyanSmallwood	yup that's the one
2015-11-22 10:56:47	Porkepikk	But Godard is not mao pro those days i think
2015-11-22 10:56:54	Porkepikk	I never heard of it at leat
2015-11-22 10:57:03	Porkepikk	He is pro palestine that s all i know
2015-11-22 10:57:20	RyanSmallwood	I think he was just quoting his philosophy, probably not endorsing what he did

2015-11-22 10:59:29	RyanSmallwood	does Godard go out anywhere anymore?
2015-11-22 10:59:30	keqin	from wiki:
2015-11-22 10:59:32	keqin	"The film returns to "2 Metaphor." Marcus and Ivitch have an affair in the same house in the winter; they talk about painting and political issues, such as Mao Zedong's opinion of the French Revolution and how Russians will never be Europeans. "
2015-11-22 11:00:10	keqin	im doing some deep googling right now
2015-11-22 11:00:11	Porkepikk	He released a movie in something like 2013-4
2015-11-22 11:00:29	RyanSmallwood	I know he makes movies, but I didn't think he did publicity for them so much
2015-11-22 11:00:42	Porkepikk	Well he isn t famous those days
2015-11-22 11:00:59	Porkepikk	So doesn t get a lot of coverage
2015-11-22 11:01:11	Porkepikk	But i ve heard of him being at cannes
2015-11-22 11:02:29	Porkepikk	We need a IRL meetup of TF :D
2015-11-22 11:02:48	Porkepikk	But with people all around the world not gonna be easy ...
2015-11-22 11:03:11	RyanSmallwood	haha
2015-11-22 11:04:46	keqin	alright i found the quote
2015-11-22 11:05:08	keqin	translated from a french webpage: "Marcus said that Mao, who was asked if the French Revolution of 1789 had been a good thing, said it was too early to tell."
2015-11-22 11:05:23	keqin	i remember now
2015-11-22 11:07:53	Porkepikk	Everything makes sense :O
2015-11-22 11:10:33	RyanSmallwood	I dunno if I would watch, but just to be your alarm clock Porkepikk, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon starts in 45 minutes
2015-11-22 11:10:46	keqin	Porkepikk I think mubi has a somewhat lively online film discussion forum
2015-11-22 11:11:09	RyanSmallwood	Didn't they shut their forum down a few months ago?

2015-11-22 11:11:43	keqin	haha
2015-11-22 11:11:51	RyanSmallwood	I think they want people to use their websites social networking features

2015-11-22 11:13:22	Porkepikk	Oh wait
2015-11-22 11:13:30	Porkepikk	Sorry wrong war
2015-11-22 11:19:04	RyanSmallwood	one of the reasons I'm slow to start doing video essays keqin is I want to figure out all the history of film societies/philosophy/politics stuff of the last 100 years
2015-11-22 11:19:35	RyanSmallwood	I feel like this kind of stuff needs to be talked about more in relation to film history
2015-11-22 11:20:09	Porkepikk	I want to start doing video essays on a YMS style
2015-11-22 11:20:12	Porkepikk	But extreme
2015-11-22 11:20:32	RyanSmallwood	I haven't watched any YMS essays, any recommendations?
2015-11-22 11:20:46	Porkepikk	I 'm part of the people who thinks Fight club, forrest gump, Seven are not really good movies for example
2015-11-22 11:20:49	Porkepikk	Same for birdman
2015-11-22 11:21:38	Porkepikk	Well, they re more like funny reviews than essays
2015-11-22 11:21:42	RyanSmallwood	ahhh
2015-11-22 11:21:46	Porkepikk	Start with the most known one
2015-11-22 11:22:05	RyanSmallwood	those aren't necessarily my favorite kinds of movies
2015-11-22 11:22:14	keqin	RyanSmallwood that's like almost the entire history of film lol
2015-11-22 11:22:49	RyanSmallwood	but I'm a bit wary of the trend of reviews to totally dismiss well regarded films, they may have problems, but if they're well regarded there has to be something working in them
2015-11-22 11:23:09	RyanSmallwood	keqin: heh, well get ahold of a few focused areas first and expand out gradually
2015-11-22 11:23:26	keqin	there was a good essay bordwell wrote about birdman, let me find it
2015-11-22 11:23:46	Porkepikk	Well i want to prove the contrary
2015-11-22 11:24:00	Porkepikk	My first video will be on The Schindler's List
2015-11-22 11:24:06	keqin	he basically shits on birdman and at the end of the essay was like, watch hou hsiao hsien instead

2015-11-22 11:24:34	Porkepikk	And how this movie makes entertainment out of the holocaust, while misleading people in the actual horrors of it
2015-11-22 11:25:10	keqin	Porkepikk i heard that argument made somewhere before, kubrick had something to say about it
2015-11-22 11:25:26	Porkepikk	Kubrick and Haneke talked about it
2015-11-22 11:25:34	Porkepikk	In a different way hoth

2015-11-22 11:28:26	Porkepikk	Kubrick : Schindler's List is about 1000 people surviving, the holocaust is about 1M people dying or something like that
2015-11-22 11:29:08	Porkepikk	Haneke : schindler's list is making entertainment out of the holocaust (cause it s actually easy to watch)

2015-11-22 12:06:38	RyanSmallwood	what do you think of people who say "films noir"
2015-11-22 12:06:42	Porkepik	Give us back "um" D:
2015-11-22 12:06:52	Porkepik	well at least they say it right
2015-11-22 12:06:58	Porkepik	rendez vous too
2015-11-22 12:07:00	Porkepik	it's just déjà vu
2015-11-22 12:07:06	RyanSmallwood	I understand thats how the grammar works in French
2015-11-22 12:07:14	RyanSmallwood	but to me Film Noir in english is a noun
2015-11-22 12:07:17	keqin	buster keaton video essay - tony makes another great one
2015-11-22 12:07:20	uguuuu	and for a lot of english phrases too
2015-11-22 12:07:25	uguuuu	where the adjective follows the noun
2015-11-22 12:07:27	RyanSmallwood	and switching to french grammar suddenly sounds weird to me
2015-11-22 12:07:43	uguuuu	like "secretaries general"
2015-11-22 12:07:51	Porkepik	secrétaire général
2015-11-22 12:07:56	RyanSmallwood	is that the actual plural?
2015-11-22 12:08:00	uguuuu	yeah
2015-11-22 12:08:07	RyanSmallwood	weiirrrd I'm bad at english then
2015-11-22 12:08:08	Porkepik	secrétaires générales
2015-11-22 12:08:17	Porkepik	i don't know what you are asking me actually
2015-11-22 12:08:22	Porkepik	i'm just saying it in french right now
2015-11-22 12:08:24	Porkepik	i'm lost
2015-11-22 12:08:44	Porkepik	keqin => Yeah, he doesn't release a lot of videos right now, but they are of quality
2015-11-22 12:09:22	RyanSmallwood	I usually just say "noirs" when I pluralize film noir
2015-11-22 12:09:43	uguuuu	i think... that feels more right
2015-11-22 12:09:47	RyanSmallwood	keqin: it is a great video essay!
2015-11-22 12:10:14	Porkepik	in french that would be "films noirs"
2015-11-22 12:10:21	RyanSmallwood	yeah thats the debate
2015-11-22 12:10:35	RyanSmallwood	some english critics say films noir in english sentences
2015-11-22 12:10:44	RyanSmallwood	I think films noir sounds weird in an english sentence
2015-11-22 12:10:52	Porkepik	well, in french those are words, it just means black movies, in english that's an expression
2015-11-22 12:10:56	Porkepik	not the same thing
2015-11-22 12:11:01	RyanSmallwood	yeah exactly

2015-11-22 12:11:52	RyanSmallwood	like I heard some professor say that a single piece of spaghetti is incorrect and we should say spaghetto
2015-11-22 12:11:56	RyanSmallwood	I think that's bullshit
2015-11-22 12:11:59	RyanSmallwood	its english now
2015-11-22 12:12:10	RyanSmallwood	we don't have to suddenly incorporate italian grammar
2015-11-22 12:12:16	RyanSmallwood	into an english sentence
2015-11-22 12:12:39	uguuuu	this has precedent though

2015-11-22 12:13:34	RyanSmallwood	I'm a language descriptivist, its technically just whatever people use is correct
2015-11-22 12:14:00	uguuuu	that's true, but people do use these forms too
2015-11-22 12:14:07	RyanSmallwood	as a language user you can try to change how the language is used, but if you're going against how people use it I think that's a bit perverse
2015-11-22 12:14:25	uguuuu	like it's mostly gonna be "attorneys general"

2015-11-22 12:14:49	RyanSmallwood	yeah, films noir is more borderline
2015-11-22 12:14:54	RyanSmallwood	cause enough people use it
2015-11-22 12:15:03	RyanSmallwood	spaghetto is clearly not something used in English
2015-11-22 12:15:09	uguuuu	i wouldn't say films noir or film noirs
2015-11-22 12:15:12	uguuuu	both look ugly -____-
2015-11-22 12:15:15	RyanSmallwood	yup
2015-11-22 12:15:19	RyanSmallwood	"noirs"
2015-11-22 12:16:26	uguuuu	the wikipedia entry has "films noirs"
2015-11-22 12:16:33	uguuuu	but italicized to indicate a foreign phrase
2015-11-22 12:16:50	RyanSmallwood	ahhh
2015-11-22 12:17:08	uguuuu	and just "noirs" throughout most of the article
2015-11-22 12:18:04	uguuuu	"The low-key lighting schemes of many classic film noirs" "Crime, usually murder, is an element of almost all films noir"
2015-11-22 12:18:07	uguuuu	make up your mind aaa
2015-11-22 12:19:13	RyanSmallwood	hahahahahah
2015-11-22 12:19:22	Porkepik	or everytime you use a foreign word, you speak in the forein language, like that, no more issues
2015-11-22 12:19:23	uguuuu	and a few paragraphs in the talk page about which to use
2015-11-22 12:19:32	uguuuu	someone suggests "noir films" instead
2015-11-22 12:19:41	RyanSmallwood	I think I've used that before
2015-11-22 12:19:48	uguuuu	i suggest "film noir films"
2015-11-22 12:19:55	RyanSmallwood	I might argue we should just drop the idea of film noir entirely
2015-11-22 12:20:01	RyanSmallwood	but we're stuck with it
2015-11-22 12:20:03	Porkepik	looks like Noir is a filmmaker
2015-11-22 12:20:06	uguuuu	"black films"
2015-11-22 12:20:10	uguuuu	there
2015-11-22 12:20:17	RyanSmallwood	I would just say
2015-11-22 12:20:20	RyanSmallwood	detective films
2015-11-22 12:20:20	Porkepik	"I just watched noir films, i did not like them that much"
2015-11-22 12:20:24	RyanSmallwood	twisted melodrama
2015-11-22 12:20:30	RyanSmallwood	suspense films
2015-11-22 12:20:30	uguuuu	films black
2015-11-22 12:21:07	RyanSmallwood	its not really  a cohesive genre
2015-11-22 12:21:36	RyanSmallwood	though I guess no genre is
2015-11-22 12:22:11	keqin	does film noir carry the connotation of a specific visual style as well though? if so, then would it be inadequate to just call them detective films?
2015-11-22 12:22:37	RyanSmallwood	its inconsistent in usage
2015-11-22 12:22:53	RyanSmallwood	if you look at all films, not all of them have the same visual style and the same genre themes
2015-11-22 12:23:08	RyanSmallwood	and you can find that visual style outside noir, like in horror films
2015-11-22 12:23:28	RyanSmallwood	its the whole family of characteristics thing
2015-11-22 12:23:33	keqin	oh yah
2015-11-22 12:23:35	RyanSmallwood	if it has enough features its called film noir
2015-11-22 12:23:44	RyanSmallwood	but there's no single feature thats common to all of them
2015-11-22 12:27:28	Porkepik	uguuuu => Do you have letterboxd ?

2015-11-22 12:33:19	Porkepikk	but not really a specific genre nowadays i think

2015-11-22 17:39:19	tomflint	you guys should start building up good ratios on private trackers. The forums always have invite threads --- so you can move around.
2015-11-22 17:39:24	tomflint	a good ratio is like a train ticket

2015-11-22 17:46:48	RyanSmallwood	I think for KG you have to post in the forums a reason why someone should be invited or something
2015-11-22 17:47:11	tomflint	I don't know about that...
2015-11-22 17:47:24	tomflint	you're usually accountable for people you invite, to a point

2015-11-22 17:47:49	tomflint	on the other trackers where people were offering invites they wanted proof of ratio from a second tracker -- which is decent
2015-11-22 17:49:00	RyanSmallwood	KG recently got shut down and had to start up again, so KG has made it much more difficult to join

2015-11-22 17:52:55	RyanSmallwood	I'm sure the subs get shared after they're made but I've seen a lot of exclusive stuff show up on KG first
2015-11-22 17:53:07	indeedwatson	the girl i got the invite from had great ratio just from subtitles, but im not sure how 
2015-11-22 17:53:09	uguuuu	and the site as a whole feels sort of dated compared to other trackers
2015-11-22 17:53:27	tomflint	a good sub scene would be great
2015-11-22 17:53:41	RyanSmallwood	I like KG's search engine way better than other private trackers I've used
2015-11-22 17:53:47	tomflint	is it a straight ratio or do they do a points system?

2015-11-22 19:25:15	Porkepik	if so, no i bought it a while, it was sold by a british shop of posters
2015-11-22 19:25:21	Porkepik	amazon.co.uk
2015-11-22 19:25:26	indeedwatson	you can send a file to a shop and they'll print it

2015-11-22 19:29:20	indeedwatson	framing is so expensive here

2015-11-22 19:29:58	indeedwatson	there is no ikea in argentina

2015-11-22 19:30:17	Card74	probably the US Alien theatrical poster as well, it's been years and I don't remember them all... probably a horizontal Trainspotting poster, too

2015-11-22 23:41:49	AlexJ44	did it go well in that regard?
2015-11-22 23:42:00	RyanSmallwood	yeah worked pretty nicely
2015-11-22 23:42:14	RyanSmallwood	I kind of wish there was more customizing the screen and chat size
2015-11-22 23:42:25	RyanSmallwood	but overall the screening seemed to go without any problems
2015-11-22 23:42:45	AlexJ44	that's good, it's a good platform
2015-11-22 23:44:25	RyanSmallwood	I wonder if you could log into chat on your phone, and watch fullscreen on your computer
2015-11-22 23:45:49	AlexJ44	well that works well with IRC
2015-11-22 23:46:08	AlexJ44	I'd do theather if I could watch the film on one screen and use the IRC on another, which I actually can on my computer
2015-11-22 23:46:17	AlexJ44	if you have two screens, you can easily open two tabs
2015-11-22 23:48:03	RyanSmallwood	phone seems to work, though you need two different accounts
2015-11-22 23:48:31	RyanSmallwood	or just not be logged in on one device

2015-11-23 11:52:27	keqin	malcolm x was a long movie
2015-11-23 11:53:51	indeedwatson	never saw it
2015-11-23 11:53:58	indeedwatson	worth it?
2015-11-23 11:56:12	keqin	yeah, it's worth it if you can set aside some time for it, and if you dont have time to read his autobiography
2015-11-23 11:57:03	keqin	aside from being relevant to islam in america, showcasing basic points regarding the struggle of black liberation, and being a piece of american history
2015-11-23 11:57:11	keqin	it was well made and well acted by denzel washington
2015-11-23 11:57:46	keqin	also is notable for its pre-production
2015-11-23 11:58:35	keqin	(according to wiki, spike lee partly uses francis coppola's strategy of getting money to finance the film)
2015-11-23 11:59:28	indeedwatson	i don't think i've seen a spike lee film
2015-11-23 11:59:58	keqin	spike lee is getting a lot of bad press nowadays, but i can people becoming more interested in examining his early movies due to the revival of race relations
2015-11-23 12:00:48	keqin	his ideas are not outdated, u should check out Do the Right Thing for sure

2015-11-23 12:30:03	keqin	actually discovered today a piracy-based film society: http://www.piratecinema.org/
2015-11-23 12:32:22	keqin	it's a position that i dont see being held on the TF thread- they pretty much call for a complete remodeling of IP laws
2015-11-23 12:34:07	RyanSmallwood	if they're based in Berlin, I think Germany has much much stricter enforcement of IP laws and piracy than the US
2015-11-23 12:35:24	keqin	why's that?
2015-11-23 12:36:15	RyanSmallwood	I dunno the reason, I just heard the government is much more active about prosecuting piracy

2015-11-23 13:30:21	indeedwatson	depends on the type of show
2015-11-23 13:30:44	mstarrr	I find I'm less attentive, miss little details, when 5 episodes deep.  I remember watching the wire last season one ep at a time and it was a totally diff. experience

2015-11-23 13:31:20	carson	sometimes having that time to let an episode sit with you is important

2015-11-23 13:31:51	mstarrr	'I wonder what will happen next' while standing in the shower
2015-11-23 13:32:46	indeedwatson	Lost wouldn't be the same experience binge watching
2015-11-23 13:33:05	mstarrr	Really?  I've yet to see it, but I remember class mates talking about the drama etc
2015-11-23 13:33:21	carson	hmm I haven't experienced it with Lost, I actually watched every episode the day it aired
2015-11-23 13:33:45	indeedwatson	im pretty sure i will never feel anything like the cliffhangers at the end of the seasons
2015-11-23 13:33:49	mstarrr	Were episode end cliffhangers
2015-11-23 13:33:50	mstarrr	ahhhh
2015-11-23 13:33:53	indeedwatson	and the anticipation of a new season
2015-11-23 13:34:14	mstarrr	When I watch Lost I'll take it slow, then :)
2015-11-23 13:34:17	carson	indeed lost was rough with cliffhangers
2015-11-23 13:34:22	indeedwatson	one of the main things about Lost was the mystery, so the cliffhangers were huge
2015-11-23 13:34:30	carson	the waits were killer
2015-11-23 13:34:51	carson	feel like shows I binge watch I tend to forget character names and plot details quickly after
2015-11-23 13:34:52	mstarrr	If advertising/money/whatever wasn't an issue, would you do massive cliffhangers at season end
2015-11-23 13:34:57	mstarrr	carson, yes, exactly
2015-11-23 13:35:04	Porkepik	And is porn kosher to discuss ? ʘ ͜ʖ ʘ
2015-11-23 13:35:21	indeedwatson	carson: yeah, not to mention the contribution of the internet

2015-11-23 13:35:27	carson	sure, as long as it's appropriate

2015-11-23 13:35:33	indeedwatson	mstarrr: haha
2015-11-23 13:35:38	carson	in good taste
2015-11-23 13:36:13	indeedwatson	mstarrr: cliffhangers depend on the show, I don't like shows that do it just because, it seems to be a trope, but in Lost it was part of the core idea
2015-11-23 13:37:01	mstarrr	I also feel like a lot of discussion is lost -- the breaking bad subreddit was awesome, each episode watch through
2015-11-23 13:37:07	mstarrr	but Narcos.. no discussion
2015-11-23 13:37:52	indeedwatson	yeah, most recently, with mad men, for me
2015-11-23 13:38:34	mstarrr	What season are you on?
2015-11-23 13:38:42	mstarrr	And mad men.. eh, I lost interest :/
2015-11-23 13:38:46	mstarrr	Probs cuz bingewatched
2015-11-23 13:39:04	indeedwatson	i bing watched the first seasons and then as it came out
2015-11-23 13:39:50	carson	binging can really change the way you perceive a show, good and bad, can we all agree?
2015-11-23 13:40:02	indeedwatson	yeah
2015-11-23 13:41:22	carson	there's season to season binging and then there is entire series binging
2015-11-23 13:42:22	mstarrr	carson, ya, I agree
2015-11-23 13:42:25	uguuuu	ʘ ͜ʖ ʘ
2015-11-23 13:42:43	carson	and I guess it depends on the show for how appropriate it is
2015-11-23 13:43:01	carson	that's the part that gets tricky
2015-11-23 13:44:06	mstarrr	I've been doing a partial binge watch of Narcos
2015-11-23 13:44:17	carson	then there is also different paces of watching each episode, I guess that would come into play
2015-11-23 13:44:24	mstarrr	I'll watch one ep, but if I want to watch more/watch while doing other stuff, i'll play earlier episodes
2015-11-23 13:44:40	mstarrr	I get the continuity/seeing stuff more to notice details, without overloading

2015-11-23 14:18:58	Porkepik	Avant-guarde
2015-11-23 14:19:12	Porkepik	i mean i knew about it, but that made me think about yesterday
2015-11-23 14:19:17	indeedwatson	oh, doesn't surprise me
2015-11-23 14:19:40	indeedwatson	i can hear him say it with his accent
2015-11-23 14:20:10	mstarrr	When talking film w/ someone much smarter than me, I'll throw in as many 'mise en scenes' as i can
2015-11-23 14:20:15	mstarrr	so I don't come off as too retarded
2015-11-23 14:21:06	indeedwatson	haha
2015-11-23 14:21:50	Porkepik	I want to hear an english say it
2015-11-23 14:21:53	Porkepik	that would be funny
2015-11-23 14:22:06	mstarrr	Film noir or mise en scene?

2015-11-23 18:50:27	Zaiso	have you seen nightcrawler and akira?
2015-11-23 18:50:33	@Carson	yes
2015-11-23 18:50:53	indeedwatson	yes
2015-11-23 18:51:14	indeedwatson	nightcrawler is fun and akira is one of my favorite movies
2015-11-23 18:51:23	Zaiso	i just noticed there's a reference to akira in nightcrawler
2015-11-23 18:51:29	Zaiso	i was wondering if anyone else noticed it
2015-11-23 18:51:37	indeedwatson	can't say i did
2015-11-23 18:52:48	Zaiso	i might make a post about it sometime i've been thinking about it and the kind of post modern city in nightcrawler has a lot of parallels to neo-tokyo
2015-11-23 18:53:14	Zaiso	if you ever watch nightcrawler again pay attention to the music while they're driving the mustang
2015-11-23 18:53:24	indeedwatson	i probably will
2015-11-23 18:53:32	indeedwatson	tho the music is one of the things i liked least about it
2015-11-23 18:56:00	Zaiso	yea the way the music is done in nightcrawler is a bit heavy handed
2015-11-23 18:56:15	Zaiso	that aside it was my first time watching akira
2015-11-23 18:56:22	Zaiso	and that soundtrack blew me away so good

2015-11-23 20:36:44	AlexJ44	but i had this idea of his

2015-11-23 20:37:02	AlexJ44	and the film is interesting in that regard
2015-11-23 20:37:23	AlexJ44	it's based on a journalist's book, David Lipsky, who's portraeyd by jesse eisenberg
2015-11-23 20:38:09	RyanSmallwood	what video essay are you working on Porkepik ?
2015-11-23 20:38:37	Porkepik	On Schindler's List
2015-11-23 20:38:58	Porkepik	And the portrait (does that work in english ?) of the holocaust in the movie
2015-11-23 20:39:48	lofiluv	i think portrait works
2015-11-23 20:39:52	lofiluv	or portrayal
2015-11-23 20:40:14	RyanSmallwood	ohhhhh
2015-11-23 20:40:20	Porkepik	oh yeah portrayal
2015-11-23 20:40:34	Porkepik	anyway, i think the movie does a very bad job at representing the holocaust
2015-11-23 20:40:43	AlexJ44	i'd like to see that
2015-11-23 20:41:17	Porkepik	Yeah i almost finish the working
2015-11-23 20:41:31	Porkepik	I'm gonna start by showing 3 scenes in the movie
2015-11-23 20:41:45	Porkepik	And why, in my opinion, they don't work, they create fake feelings
2015-11-23 20:42:08	Porkepik	then i will talk about the movie in general and his impact in the history of the awareness of the holocaust
2015-11-23 20:42:23	RyanSmallwood	am I going to have to watch Schindler's List now so I can watch your video essay?
2015-11-23 20:42:34	Porkepik	Well, i'm gonna spoil it
2015-11-23 20:42:46	Porkepik	I mean, i can try to keep a part of the video spoiler free
2015-11-23 20:42:59	Porkepik	and one of the 3 scenes is actually the last one
2015-11-23 20:43:42	RyanSmallwood	nah don't worry about spoilers

2015-11-23 20:45:25	Porkepik	Seems interesting
2015-11-23 20:45:28	RyanSmallwood	Santa Sangre is great
2015-11-23 20:45:38	Porkepik	mstarrr => I won't sorry ...
2015-11-23 20:46:27	mstarrr	The mise en scene is absolutely fag
2015-11-23 20:46:28	Porkepik	Also, just because the director is french doesn't make it foreign
2015-11-23 20:46:34	mstarrr	So many little details of today transcend
2015-11-23 20:46:39	mstarrr	ya that's what my film teacher qqed about
2015-11-23 20:46:52	mstarrr	But srsly, amazing film.. look at the cigs, they're 3/4th filter
2015-11-23 20:46:52	Porkepik	I don't think we can choose ONE best foreign movie of all time
2015-11-23 20:46:59	Porkepik	that's not possible unless you watched everything
2015-11-23 20:47:00	mstarrr	or the car design, straight 1930s w/ the headlights
2015-11-23 20:47:13	RyanSmallwood	ehh "foreign" isn't a useful category of movie
2015-11-23 20:47:14	mstarrr	and fire escapes on high rises that go into the clouds, made of bricks
2015-11-23 20:47:47	tomflint	Porkepik: you can also leverage the referral system to get free months
2015-11-23 20:47:55	mstarrr	Even the airport -- they literally try to keep the trash out from foreigners
2015-11-23 20:49:24	tomflint	RyanSmallwood: Mubi is 'international' film --- so whatever is good. It's like they went through every film studies syllabus, purchased the rights, and posted them.
2015-11-23 20:49:31	mstarrr	..one day someone will agree that it is the best movie ever made
2015-11-23 20:49:38	RyanSmallwood	5th element is a French movie though right? Just made in English to reach a wider audience?
2015-11-23 20:49:48	Porkepik	well, part french part american
2015-11-23 20:49:54	Porkepik	one of the writer was american i think
2015-11-23 20:50:14	Porkepik	actors are americans also
2015-11-23 20:50:30	RyanSmallwood	well yeah, anything big budget is usually aiming at the American market
2015-11-23 20:50:35	RyanSmallwood	like the Ninja Turtles movies
2015-11-23 20:50:41	mstarrr	The director and producer were americanjs, and it was distributed by 2 french companies
2015-11-23 20:50:41	Porkepik	Awesome movie
2015-11-23 20:50:43	RyanSmallwood	aimed at the American market, made by a Hong Kong studio
2015-11-23 20:51:05	Porkepik	The New Ninja Turtles Wave
2015-11-23 20:51:06	Porkepik	It's coming
2015-11-23 20:51:13	Porkepik	And Holywood isn't prepare for it ...
2015-11-23 20:52:06	mstarrr	Are they running out of superheros? :(
2015-11-23 20:52:16	RyanSmallwood	isn't   Luc Besson doing to do another sci-fi epic like 5th element again next?
2015-11-23 20:53:03	mstarrr	I'm not even sure
2015-11-23 20:53:08	Porkepik	I didn't even like Léon
2015-11-23 20:53:09	mstarrr	Do you have any other Luc Besson recommendations?
2015-11-23 20:53:12	mstarrr	I'm a filmnoob
2015-11-23 20:53:27	indeedwatson	i liked leon
2015-11-23 20:53:30	RyanSmallwood	Valerian
2015-11-23 20:54:27	tomflint	The non-american cut of Leon is creeeeepy
2015-11-23 20:54:47	RyanSmallwood	ohhh Luc Bessson is going to start shooting Valerian in December
2015-11-23 20:54:52	tomflint	I still like it, but I think it's overhyped.
2015-11-23 20:54:59	mstarrr	tomflint, should I subtitle leon?
2015-11-23 20:55:08	mstarrr	Er, i read that wrong
2015-11-23 20:55:20	tomflint	ha
2015-11-23 20:55:33	mstarrr	Ah diff movie, torrenting :(

2015-11-23 21:01:15	Porkepik	There is one shot that is just genius
2015-11-23 21:01:40	Porkepik	The 2 parents looking at the door and it makes a perfect shot of the side of their face
2015-11-23 21:01:44	Porkepik	don't know how to explain
2015-11-23 21:02:03	Porkepik	but it's so perfect and satisfying to look at
2015-11-23 21:03:01	tomflint	take a screencap!
2015-11-23 21:04:28	Porkepik	I mean, nothing exceptional
2015-11-23 21:04:36	mstarrr	You can't cocktease us now
2015-11-23 21:04:37	Porkepik	But it's a movie from 1959
2015-11-23 21:05:26	Porkepik	fuck imgur
2015-11-23 21:06:04	Porkepik	wtf
2015-11-23 21:06:06	Porkepik	can't upload
2015-11-23 21:06:15	RyanSmallwood	well, Porkepik could cocktease us, and there would be nothing we could do about it
2015-11-23 21:06:41	indeedwatson	he already did it before with that joke he never said

2015-11-23 21:08:09	RyanSmallwood	that is a great shot, if it happens when I think it happens
2015-11-23 21:08:14	Porkepik	In a HD quality, that would make a good background i think (for people who are into that tho ...)
2015-11-23 21:09:18	indeedwatson	i tend not to like background with people in them
2015-11-23 21:10:03	Porkepik	Yeah, as i said, not for everyone
2015-11-23 21:10:08	tomflint	that's a nose!
2015-11-23 21:10:34	indeedwatson	that is two noses
2015-11-23 21:10:39	indeedwatson	but only one chin
2015-11-23 21:11:26	tomflint	its small, but this is my favorite shot from Vertigo -- https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xaf1/t51.2885-15/e35/11377579_967635109961167_1586863547_n.jpg

2015-11-23 21:12:01	tomflint	I had that as a desktop for the longest time
2015-11-23 21:12:11	Porkepik	Hello tian, first time i see you there i think
2015-11-23 21:12:11	tomflint	its really amazing
2015-11-23 21:12:21	tian	I have a picture that looks quite similar to that one, but with some friends posing
2015-11-23 21:12:32	tian	Porkepik: hi, yes, I haven't talked much yet
2015-11-23 21:13:03	tian	I have been online for a few days though
2015-11-23 21:13:24	RyanSmallwood	Hey Porkepik isn't that screenshot they're reacting to something? Like the whole time they've been arguing and then they hear some news and for the first time they react in the same way?  Bah my memory is shit sorry.
2015-11-23 21:13:51	Porkepik	Well, might spoil a little bit of 400 blows
2015-11-23 21:13:53	Porkepik	can PM you
2015-11-23 21:13:54	indeedwatson	i haven't seen vertigo yet, should i open that image
2015-11-23 21:14:10	tomflint	yup
2015-11-23 21:14:20	indeedwatson	i've probably had most of the movie spoiled anyway
2015-11-23 21:14:21	tomflint	no spoilers or anything -- just a pretty frame
2015-11-23 21:14:33	indeedwatson	nice
2015-11-23 21:14:42	indeedwatson	nice white borders

2015-11-23 22:48:53	Porkepik	I respect mothravka but he has some weird rating
2015-11-23 22:48:58	Porkepik	1 star to Akira ?
2015-11-23 22:49:08	Porkepik	but at least he doesn't overrate movies
2015-11-23 22:49:19	Porkepik	oh wait
2015-11-23 22:49:22	Porkepik	a little bit ...
2015-11-23 22:49:51	indeedwatson	woah i think i just lost respect for him
2015-11-23 22:49:53	Porkepik	Yeah, it's my opinion anyway :P
2015-11-23 22:50:02	Porkepik	why ?
2015-11-23 22:50:06	indeedwatson	i didn't see he rated akira
2015-11-23 22:50:09	Porkepik	the 1 star to akira ?
2015-11-23 22:50:20	Porkepik	There is also 1 star for Princess Bride
2015-11-23 22:50:22	Porkepik	I don't know why
2015-11-23 22:51:10	indeedwatson	i don't really care about princess bride
2015-11-23 22:51:13	Porkepik	3 star to 12 angry men, i guess it was not his kind of movie
2015-11-23 22:59:39	RyanSmallwood	I don't like giving star ratings to movies
2015-11-23 23:01:34	indeedwatson	me neither but everyone else does it and i feel it gives at least a bearing for other people of my tastes
2015-11-23 23:02:13	RyanSmallwood	yeah it has a practical use, i just don't like it
2015-11-23 23:04:06	RyanSmallwood	I have a list fetish though
2015-11-23 23:04:09	RyanSmallwood	and some people hate lists
2015-11-23 23:04:16	indeedwatson	 i'd call it a social use
2015-11-23 23:04:43	indeedwatson	yeah a few people here have that list fetish :p
2015-11-23 23:08:42	RyanSmallwood	I used to make really big favorite movie lists
2015-11-23 23:08:53	RyanSmallwood	but it takes a lot of time, and its impractical to just throw a giant list at someone
2015-11-23 23:09:07	RyanSmallwood	I was thinking of updating one this year just to track how my tastes have changed
2015-11-23 23:09:16	RyanSmallwood	but it takes a long time to assemble a long list
2015-11-23 23:10:06	indeedwatson	my main problem with that is that years down the line i will see that list and be ashamed
2015-11-23 23:10:24	RyanSmallwood	heh, thats part of the point
2015-11-23 23:11:25	RyanSmallwood	usually the stuff in the near pass is more embarrassing than the distant past
2015-11-23 23:12:10	indeedwatson	my favorite film a few years back was oldboy
2015-11-23 23:12:13	indeedwatson	before, kill bill
2015-11-23 23:12:22	indeedwatson	and way, way back, vidocq
2015-11-23 23:12:29	indeedwatson	so i can't agree
2015-11-23 23:12:51	RyanSmallwood	heh, but way way back gets cuter
2015-11-23 23:12:54	RyanSmallwood	you're like awww
2015-11-23 23:13:03	RyanSmallwood	look at that shit I liked back when I was tiny and simple
2015-11-23 23:13:07	indeedwatson	who's even heard of vidocq tho
2015-11-23 23:13:12	RyanSmallwood	I have!
2015-11-23 23:13:31	RyanSmallwood	I was also like "why was I excited about that movie"
2015-11-23 23:13:46	RyanSmallwood	though honestly I haven't seen it since forever so I have no idea how I would rate it today
2015-11-23 23:14:04	indeedwatson	woah
2015-11-23 23:14:18	indeedwatson	you're the first person i know who's seen it!
2015-11-23 23:14:23	indeedwatson	i know exactly why i liked it
2015-11-23 23:14:46	indeedwatson	weird visuals, reflective mask that was cool af, and a plot twist
2015-11-23 23:15:52	RyanSmallwood	yup yup
2015-11-23 23:16:16	RyanSmallwood	I think I saw it on a list of steampunk films
2015-11-23 23:16:21	RyanSmallwood	back when I first got netflix
2015-11-23 23:16:40	RyanSmallwood	and I thought film history was a thing you could just google the types of movies you wanted to watch and you would find them
2015-11-23 23:17:18	indeedwatson	netflix?
2015-11-23 23:17:27	indeedwatson	I watched it way before that then
2015-11-23 23:17:45	RyanSmallwood	thats just how I came across it randomly
2015-11-23 23:18:59	indeedwatson	i saw it on cable
2015-11-23 23:19:15	indeedwatson	back on those days where i had to check a magazine to catch films from the start
2015-11-23 23:24:36	RyanSmallwood	hmmm
2015-11-23 23:25:00	RyanSmallwood	I did a top 1000 films at the end of 2012
2015-11-23 23:25:09	RyanSmallwood	should I update it every 3 years and do one this year?
2015-11-23 23:25:42	indeedwatson	if it's fun for you
2015-11-23 23:26:02	RyanSmallwood	not right now really, but i feel like in the future it might be cool to look back on
2015-11-23 23:29:12	Porkepik	There is quite a lot of top 1000 lists
2015-11-23 23:29:40	Porkepik	this one is quite known : https://beta.icheckmovies.com/lists/1001+movies+you+must+see+before+you+die/
2015-11-23 23:29:40		[ http://is.gd/WdDW8A ]
2015-11-23 23:29:48	RyanSmallwood	I feel like its a pretty good number for looking at film history
2015-11-23 23:29:55	RyanSmallwood	averages 10 movies per year
2015-11-23 23:30:09	Porkepik	But then there is Pretty Woman in it :P
2015-11-23 23:30:26	RyanSmallwood	well, that is a movie you must see before you die
2015-11-23 23:30:49	RyanSmallwood	(actually I haven't seen it, hopefully I do before I die!)
2015-11-23 23:30:56	Porkepik	You better
2015-11-23 23:31:09	Porkepik	Life isn't completed until you finish this list
2015-11-23 23:31:30	indeedwatson	is pretty woman wityh julia roberts?
2015-11-23 23:31:31	Porkepik	I did 10% but i'm not doing it, just checking a movie i watched if it's part of the list
2015-11-23 23:31:35	Porkepik	yeah
2015-11-23 23:31:54	Porkepik	11% now with The 400 blows !
2015-11-23 23:33:24	Porkepik	They put the 3 Toy story ...
2015-11-23 23:33:28	Porkepik	The first one is obvious
2015-11-23 23:33:49	Porkepik	But 2 better movies could have been use instead of including the trilogy
2015-11-23 23:34:09	RyanSmallwood	I'm at like 48%
2015-11-23 23:34:14	RyanSmallwood	of the 1001 movies list
2015-11-23 23:34:24	indeedwatson	YMS made the argument that Toy Story 3 is 2 again
2015-11-23 23:34:39	Porkepik	yeah, i actually think it's 1 and 2
2015-11-23 23:35:14	Porkepik	In TS1 they get abuse by a kid that doesn't play with toys correctly
2015-11-23 23:35:18	Porkepik	in TS3, the same
2015-11-23 23:35:22	Porkepik	the young kids abuse the toys
2015-11-23 23:35:45	indeedwatson	i think he means the structure
2015-11-23 23:36:05	Porkepik	yeah but he also talks about a few scenes that they reuse
2015-11-23 23:36:32	Porkepik	for example the scene in the waste disposal looks like the airport scene
2015-11-23 23:36:39	indeedwatson	i don't think i've watched that video actually because i liked themovie a lot for personal reasons
2015-11-23 23:37:06	Porkepik	TS3 ? I enjoyed it as an average nicely done movie
2015-11-23 23:37:17	Porkepik	the 3D looks better than in most recent Pixar
2015-11-23 23:37:20	indeedwatson	yeah
2015-11-23 23:37:23	Porkepik	And i still like the character
2015-11-23 23:37:46	Porkepik	but it's still overrated
2015-11-23 23:38:03	Porkepik	I prefer TS3 to Brave or Inside Out
2015-11-23 23:38:15	Porkepik	the 3D looks like shit, and the story bored me
2015-11-23 23:38:20	Porkepik	Brave had so much potential
2015-11-23 23:38:20	indeedwatson	well i haven't rewatched it

2015-11-24 21:57:53	Carson_	that's what I meant lol
2015-11-24 21:58:34	Carson_	how do you all feel about plot holes and inconstancies in the plot?
2015-11-24 21:59:05	indeedwatson	depends on the movie i guess
2015-11-24 22:01:43	AlexJ44	i don't usually care about plot hole
2015-11-24 22:02:00	AlexJ44	depends on the films, though, but unless it's something very blatant then its fine
2015-11-24 22:07:02	RyanSmallwood	I don't look for them, only bothers me if I can't ignore them

2015-11-24 23:52:23	Porkepik	there is Toy Story 2, Toy Story 3, Grease, Pretty Woman
2015-11-24 23:52:30	Porkepik	but no mononoke hime, amélie, snatch
2015-11-24 23:52:44	Porkepik	no david lynch movies
2015-11-24 23:53:06	uguuuu	you can't have everything vOv
2015-11-24 23:53:57	Porkepik	well, it's not like i trusted the list

2015-11-24 23:54:11	uguuuu	i don't see how that makes it shit
2015-11-24 23:54:17	uguuuu	just because a handful of movies you like aren't included
2015-11-24 23:55:08	Porkepik	just took some example
2015-11-24 23:55:15	Porkepik	still, a lot of bad american movies
2015-11-24 23:55:18	Porkepik	almost no foreign movies
2015-11-24 23:55:24	uguuuu	like, i'm pretty sure the toy stories are grouped as one entry
2015-11-24 23:55:31	Porkepik	nope
2015-11-24 23:55:39	uguuuu	and grease and pretty woman are cultural touchstones

2015-11-24 23:59:32	Porkepik	let me check

2015-11-25 00:00:53	indeedwatson	not including any lynch is a joke
2015-11-25 00:00:58	uguuuu	well, it's not "1001 greatest movies" either
2015-11-25 00:01:12	Porkepik	can't find anything on the internet, no idea what a cultural touchstone could be
2015-11-25 00:03:12	uguuuu	i'm pretty sure blue velvet is on the current list anyway

2015-11-25 00:32:28	TheHoopsProphet	its kind of like a remake or adapration of Perfect Blue
2015-11-25 00:32:37	TheHoopsProphet	we actually have a lot of the same movies
2015-11-25 00:32:50	Porkepik	yeah, btw i don't rate very normally

2015-11-25 00:34:12	Porkepik	pretty depressing

2015-11-25 14:13:12	Porkepik	You know what piss me off
2015-11-25 14:13:30	Porkepik	Not only it is one of the most generic trailer done
2015-11-25 14:13:44	Porkepik	but still, the action is well paced in the trailer
2015-11-25 14:13:51	Porkepik	but in the movie, i'm sure that's not gonna be the case
2015-11-25 14:14:15	indeedwatson	i misread that and thought you said one of the greatest movies from the 50's
2015-11-25 14:14:39	Porkepik	Seriously, Marvel could learn from Mad max
2015-11-25 14:15:02	indeedwatson	nah man, they have everything planned until 2050
2015-11-25 14:15:11	indeedwatson	their plan works, just look at fantastic 4
2015-11-25 14:15:16	Porkepik	Yeah ...
2015-11-25 14:15:33	Porkepik	The only marvel movie i liked so far is Guardian of the galaxy
2015-11-25 14:15:54	indeedwatson	it was disappointing to me
2015-11-25 14:16:03	Porkepik	Oh why ?
2015-11-25 14:16:08	indeedwatson	not that i thought it was horrible, i was just expecting it to be more fun
2015-11-25 14:16:19	indeedwatson	i even watched it high and thought it was a bit meh
2015-11-25 14:16:52	Porkepik	Oh ok, yeah i had fun but i was not expecting anything crazy
2015-11-25 14:16:53	indeedwatson	i think i liked avengers 1 more
2015-11-25 14:17:13	indeedwatson	and i think those are the only marvel movies i've seen
2015-11-25 14:17:19	indeedwatson	not counting the old xmen movies
2015-11-25 14:18:34	Porkepik	lol, i was expecting /r/movies to at least aknowledge to fact it is a very generic trailer
2015-11-25 14:18:49	Porkepik	but no
2015-11-25 14:18:53	Porkepik	top comments is hype comments
2015-11-25 14:18:55	Porkepik	are*
2015-11-25 14:19:36	uguuuu	dat bland marvel cinematographic house style
2015-11-25 14:20:22	Porkepik	uguuuu => I was a dick yesterday, don't know why i felt i had to comment on that list
2015-11-25 14:20:40	Porkepik	you were completly right about it being better than some others and the fact it is targeted to more casual viewers
2015-11-25 14:20:59	indeedwatson	i still think it's a shit list :p
2015-11-25 14:21:00	Porkepik	But you know, very often, i have my ego and i can't admit it until the next day ...
2015-11-25 14:21:19	indeedwatson	what is the top film in it?
2015-11-25 14:21:30	Porkepik	oh no it's not a top list
2015-11-25 14:21:41	uguuuu	i think it's a pretty good list, if you look only at the things you don't recognize/aren't generally included in such lists
2015-11-25 14:21:44	Porkepik	just the 1001 movies to see before your body is full of worms and shit :P
2015-11-25 14:21:55	uguuuu	but at the end of the day... it is just a coffee table book :V
2015-11-25 14:22:07	uguuuu	and every year they remove some films for new releases so they can put out a new edition
2015-11-25 14:23:27	uguuuu	it's in chronological order, and there's an epub of one of the editions floating around somewhere
2015-11-25 14:26:53	Porkepik	Yeah, not my list i guess
2015-11-25 14:28:36	RyanSmallwood	later to the discussion but...
2015-11-25 14:28:44	RyanSmallwood	Russo Brothers have been very good at directing their action scenes
2015-11-25 14:29:00	RyanSmallwood	so I'm optimistic for the new Captain America to be one of the better Marvel movies
2015-11-25 14:29:18	RyanSmallwood	I've enjoyed the previous Captain America movies the most out of the Marvel superhero stuff as well
2015-11-25 14:29:46	uguuuu	yeah, most seem to agree that winter soldier was the most coherent and well directed of them
2015-11-25 14:30:04	indeedwatson	i heard that was decent
2015-11-25 14:30:10	indeedwatson	but not enough to make me want to watch it
2015-11-25 14:30:14	indeedwatson	unless it's with friends
2015-11-25 14:30:39	Porkepik	People are asking for a black widow movie
2015-11-25 14:30:43	Porkepik	i have no idea what her power are
2015-11-25 14:30:53	RyanSmallwood	I know the Russo Brothers just had their minds blown by The Raid and as a result tried to make the action scenes in Winter Soldier suck less than actions scenes in blockbusters usually do
2015-11-25 14:30:54	uguuuu	superpower: is a woman
2015-11-25 14:31:02	Porkepik	make me think of Under the Skin
2015-11-25 14:31:11	Porkepik	cause it's pretty lmuch that in UTS :P
2015-11-25 14:32:16	indeedwatson	lol imagine a marvel movie as experimental as UTS
2015-11-25 14:32:19	RyanSmallwood	Avengers 2 basically snuck in the mini black widow origin story cause there won't be a movie
2015-11-25 14:32:25	RyanSmallwood	crazy ballet assassin school
2015-11-25 14:32:58	Porkepik	I like Scarllet
2015-11-25 14:33:06	Porkepik	Scarlett*
2015-11-25 14:33:10	RyanSmallwood	yeah, she's the best
2015-11-25 14:33:18	Porkepik	But i don't want to watch Lucy
2015-11-25 14:33:21	Porkepik	that would piss me off
2015-11-25 14:33:28	RyanSmallwood	hah Lucy is fine
2015-11-25 14:33:33	RyanSmallwood	where's your French pride?
2015-11-25 14:33:44	Porkepik	Luc Besson ? The French Shame ? :D
2015-11-25 14:33:49	Porkepik	No, he is fine
2015-11-25 14:33:50	RyanSmallwood	ahahahaha
2015-11-25 14:33:54	Porkepik	but i didn't like Léon
2015-11-25 14:33:56	uguuuu	lol
2015-11-25 14:34:03	Porkepik	5th element was fun
2015-11-25 14:34:24	Porkepik	But Luc Besson is hardly french in his way of directing movie
2015-11-25 14:35:10	Porkepik	French movies are suppose to be boring parisian stories :P
2015-11-25 14:35:16	RyanSmallwood	hahaha
2015-11-25 14:35:30	indeedwatson	amelie is boring?
2015-11-25 14:35:57	Porkepik	Don't try to find a fail in my theory
2015-11-25 14:36:02	Porkepik	it's frustrating
2015-11-25 14:36:18	Porkepik	Btw scarlett lives in Paris i think
2015-11-25 14:36:21	Porkepik	She has an appartement
2015-11-25 14:36:31	Porkepik	And during an interview she said that parisians were not really nice to her haha
2015-11-25 14:36:46	Porkepik	But then she said she was sorry later in another interview
2015-11-25 14:36:57	Porkepik	I guess it must be hard to live in Paris without knowing french
2015-11-25 14:37:03	Porkepik	since people sucks in english
2015-11-25 14:45:21	keqin	anyone have experience with webscraping?
2015-11-25 14:45:38	Porkepik	the css of /r/truefilm has an issue
2015-11-25 14:47:04	Porkepik	i did some but i'm shit with anytning related to HTTP

2015-11-25 15:03:44	TheHoopsProphet	cool :]
2015-11-25 15:03:48	Porkepik	will do the same
2015-11-25 15:03:52	Porkepik	it is on my watchlist
2015-11-25 15:04:16	indeedwatson	i've seen it twice
2015-11-25 15:04:17	TheHoopsProphet	Porkepik: you watch a lot of anime movies?
2015-11-25 15:04:23	Porkepik	no
2015-11-25 15:04:29	Porkepik	but right now i'm trying to catch up
2015-11-25 15:04:32	indeedwatson	but im now watching it in the context of how much Neuromancer influenced it
2015-11-25 15:05:06	Porkepik	but anime movies are pretty awesome
2015-11-25 15:05:20	TheHoopsProphet	5 centimeters per second is a good one
2015-11-25 15:05:21	Porkepik	I think i'm not gonna stop to the obvious one like Ghibli, Akira and Kon
2015-11-25 15:05:32	indeedwatson	you might not want to watch the last GitS trailer
2015-11-25 15:05:39	Porkepik	ok thanks on my watchlist
2015-11-25 15:06:17	indeedwatson	TheHoopsProphet: i liked garden of words more
2015-11-25 15:06:20	TheHoopsProphet	5CMPS is makoto shinkai’s best but his others are pretty good as well, basically every other shot could be it’s own wallpaper in his movies
2015-11-25 15:06:26	TheHoopsProphet	really? i didn’t get into GoW
2015-11-25 15:06:54	indeedwatson	it was better visually imo
2015-11-25 15:07:10	indeedwatson	you can see a clear visual improvement throughout his output
2015-11-25 15:07:10	TheHoopsProphet	yeah it was great visually
2015-11-25 15:07:23	indeedwatson	i didn not like voices of a distant star at all
2015-11-25 15:08:40	TheHoopsProphet	thats a short film?
2015-11-25 15:08:44	TheHoopsProphet	i havent seen that one yet

2015-11-25 15:11:39	indeedwatson	i watched it after those other two
2015-11-25 15:11:48	indeedwatson	and it felt so dumb
2015-11-25 15:12:19	indeedwatson	i kinda like how the plot keeps getting simpler and more ordinary and the animation more and more outstanding
2015-11-25 15:13:08	RyanSmallwood	I haven't seen any other makoto shinkai films, but I want to watch more
2015-11-25 15:13:18	TheHoopsProphet	Card74: you around? Priscillia was a good watch, fun movie. the soundtrack was good as well. some great long shots of their RV in the desert too. 4/5

2015-11-25 15:15:55	TheHoopsProphet	short anime series?
2015-11-25 15:16:09	RyanSmallwood	I generally don't watch anything more than 1 season, unless its very highly regarded
2015-11-25 15:16:11	Porkepik	Yeah i have to watch FSNLORWHATEVERLETTERISIT that you recommended ùe

2015-11-25 15:16:50	TheHoopsProphet	Outside of the most popular staples, Welcome to the NHK and Tatami Galaxy are two that are really good, only one season each.
2015-11-25 15:18:31	uguuuu	when i feel the need to watch anime... i just end up reading manga instead
2015-11-25 15:18:42	indeedwatson	the thing about anime series is that i can't think of any that are better than the best anime movies

2015-11-25 17:36:36	Porkepik	Well i don't think anime are for me
2015-11-25 17:37:00	indeedwatson	why
2015-11-25 17:37:09	indeedwatson	anime is not a genre anyway
2015-11-25 17:39:33	Porkepik	i meant anime show
2015-11-25 17:40:21	Porkepik	Compare to anime movies, they are less serious, and the quirky style is not for me

2015-11-26 10:28:14	@Carson	it'll be funny when someone ever makes the truetruefilm subreddit
2015-11-26 10:28:54	Sati1984	there are infinite layers of The Matrix

2015-11-26 10:31:20	RyanSmallwood	Sati1984: yeah, i agree its a legit discussion to have.   I'm trying to put my finger on exactly what is bother me about them
2015-11-26 10:31:48	indeedwatson	maybe just the fact that you see them often
2015-11-26 10:31:58	RyanSmallwood	I feel like often people come up with strong criteria of what a good films means to them, and then want answers the first time they come across the first well regarded film that doesn't meet that criteria
2015-11-26 10:32:01	@Carson	over expectation is normally what happens
2015-11-26 10:32:02	RyanSmallwood	maybe I'm just being fussy

2015-11-26 10:34:59	indeedwatson	shit, we lost a rare pepe
2015-11-26 10:37:09	RyanSmallwood	I just feel like he looked at the wider circumstances of the new wave as a whole and gave them too much significance in the discussion of a single film
2015-11-26 10:37:25	@Carson	hehe
2015-11-26 10:37:26	RyanSmallwood	and emphasized them over the production and reception of the film
2015-11-26 10:38:14	@Carson	i feel like nerdwriter could explain something that is completely false
2015-11-26 10:38:46	@Carson	and most people would believe it because he says things in such a smart voice
2015-11-26 10:39:11	indeedwatson	if that was true then i would also like the videos where he doesn't talk about art
2015-11-26 10:39:38	indeedwatson	but those go from boring to "im gonna stop watching cause hes talking nonsense"

2015-11-26 13:13:45	RyanSmallwood	yeah I watched Scott Pilgrim, and now I'm watching Tron

2015-11-26 13:14:03	Porkepik	The one on Tron is awesome
2015-11-26 13:14:05	Porkepik	yeah
2015-11-26 13:14:16	Porkepik	I could make subtitles and contact him to see if he would be interested in that
2015-11-26 13:14:42	indeedwatson	he's really narrowing his audience :)
2015-11-26 13:14:54	Porkepik	Well, he is french :P
2015-11-26 13:14:58	RyanSmallwood	I haven't seen War Games yet :(
2015-11-26 13:15:10	Porkepik	He speaks english but i guess it would be a lot of work to make a video in english
2015-11-26 13:15:31	Porkepik	oh yeah, you might prefer to watch it before
2015-11-26 13:15:36	Porkepik	there is a spoiler zone tho

2015-11-26 13:19:35	RyanSmallwood	I always thought it would be cool to make video essays on film history designed like French in Action (http://www.learner.org/resources/series83.html), so people can learn different languages while learning about Film History

2015-11-26 13:25:53	Porkepik	Fuck Youtube is always giving me that DrFrankenstein trailer as an ad ...
2015-11-26 13:26:06	indeedwatson	why do you have ads
2015-11-26 13:26:47	Porkepik	To support youtubers
2015-11-26 13:26:53	Porkepik	One of the only website i do that
2015-11-26 13:27:06	uguuuu	tell em to get patreons instead :V
2015-11-26 13:27:19	Porkepik	Yeah, but some still get some money from youtube
2015-11-26 13:27:31	Porkepik	especially french youtubers
2015-11-26 13:28:38	RyanSmallwood	the ad money is very very tiny
2015-11-26 13:28:51	RyanSmallwood	you need millions of viewers for it to be worthwhile
2015-11-26 13:29:58	RyanSmallwood	Porkepik: do you have any french film podcasts you'd recommend aside from Projection privée?

2015-11-26 13:37:40	indeedwatson	i should learn french
2015-11-26 13:38:00	indeedwatson	have you also talked about his shirt
2015-11-26 13:38:26	RyanSmallwood	regardless of his explanation, the method of listening to continuous audio in the target language with visuals that give you clues to its meaning is a very effective way of learning
2015-11-26 13:39:00	indeedwatson	subtitles too
2015-11-26 13:39:05	indeedwatson	that's how i learned english

2015-11-26 20:07:40	Porkepikk	What do people think of the Chekhov's gun here ?
2015-11-26 20:10:42	indeedwatson	i don't think much about it
2015-11-26 20:10:58	indeedwatson	it popped up in a discussion recently somewhere, can't recall if it was in truefilm 
2015-11-26 20:11:05	indeedwatson	but a guy mentioned it was mainly for theater
2015-11-26 20:12:03	Porkepikk	yeah i guess, cause in movies it doesn't make sense
2015-11-26 20:12:21	Porkepikk	it's annoying, a lot of people pointed at Nolan doing that
2015-11-26 20:13:47	markup`	I like it more when it's subverted than when it's used
2015-11-26 20:16:36	Porkepikk	Just did my first review on letterboxd

2015-11-26 20:25:19	Porkepikk	no not really, compare to fargo, doesn't look like a cold winter
2015-11-26 20:25:39	Porkepikk	more like the warm, nice winter where you drink hot chocolate next to a fire :P
2015-11-26 20:37:33	markup`	mm, cozy winters
2015-11-26 20:58:03	TempSpastic	on the subject of cozy winters
2015-11-26 20:58:24	TempSpastic	how do you feel about designating movies to be watched in specific seasons
2015-11-26 20:59:08	markup`	Makes a lot of sense

2015-11-26 21:00:35	TempSpastic	I can see that

2015-11-26 21:00:49	TempSpastic	if nothing else Lost in Translation is a rainy day movie
2015-11-26 21:03:26	markup`	That's true as well
2015-11-26 21:03:43	markup`	it's a comfy day movie
2015-11-26 21:05:04	TempSpastic	I dunno why but I feel like a lot more movies lend themselves to Fall/Winter than to Summer
2015-11-26 21:05:30	Porkepikk	Cause of movies like Her, Lost in Translation becoming main stream
2015-11-26 21:05:53	Porkepikk	it's the melancholic fashion right now
2015-11-26 21:06:37	TempSpastic	it's not just modern movies though.

2015-11-26 21:08:42	TempSpastic	lol I think that's a pretty broad generalization ;)
2015-11-26 21:09:22	Porkepikk	no, that was 100% serious, or i would have used a smiley like :P
2015-11-26 21:49:41	indeedwatson	speaking of melancholic, i need to rewatch melancholia
2015-11-26 21:58:37	TempSpastic	man I get the title of that film confused with Magnolia a lot
2015-11-26 22:00:36	indeedwatson	have you seen either?
2015-11-26 22:00:47	indeedwatson	coincidentally, i also have to rewatch magnolia
2015-11-26 22:01:17	Card74	I wasn't that impressed by it
2015-11-26 22:01:37	Card74	Short Cuts did the same thing better
2015-11-26 22:03:26	TempSpastic	I'm really not a fan of PTA so I haven't seen Magnolia
2015-11-26 22:03:50	TempSpastic	and if Melancholia is LVT, he doesn't strike me as someone I'd be a fan of either so it's not high on my list

2015-11-27 16:41:35	indeedwatson	also, it's funny how no one talks about nostalgia or the sacrifice
2015-11-27 16:41:42	indeedwatson	makes me less hyped to watch tem
2015-11-27 16:41:55	RyanSmallwood	I didn like nostalgia as much, I still need to see the sacrifice
2015-11-27 16:42:19	uguuuu	i haven't seen nostalghia or sacrifice
2015-11-27 16:42:31	RyanSmallwood	at least with the sacrifice you´ve got that Sven Nykvist cinematography to look forward to
2015-11-27 16:47:32	indeedwatson	oh are you talking tarkovsky because of that stalker thread?
2015-11-27 16:47:39	RyanSmallwood	yup
2015-11-27 16:48:00	indeedwatson	i had a long argument with someone about the nuts
2015-11-27 16:48:02	indeedwatson	in another sub
2015-11-27 16:48:08	RyanSmallwood	yeah?
2015-11-27 16:48:29	indeedwatson	he insisted it wasn't clear what they were for and that it was a flaw of the movie for not explaining
2015-11-27 16:48:41	RyanSmallwood	hah
2015-11-27 16:48:52	Porkepikk	Is there any special cut of Stalker ?
2015-11-27 16:48:59	Porkepikk	Or the 163 minutes is the legit one ?
2015-11-27 16:49:33	RyanSmallwood	yup, its a long one
2015-11-27 16:50:19	Porkepikk	I think i found a torrent

2015-11-27 16:52:03	RyanSmallwood	Andrei Rublev is the only tarkovsky film I´ve heard of having different cuts
2015-11-27 16:52:26	uguuuu	there's the grey cut, and the even greyer cut
2015-11-27 16:52:38	Porkepikk	Right cut
2015-11-27 16:54:20	indeedwatson	is there a no animal cruelty cut :(
2015-11-27 16:56:19	Porkepikk	is there a no spoil channel :(
2015-11-27 16:56:38	Porkepikk	nah joking, should have watched it sooner :P
2015-11-27 16:56:52	indeedwatson	that barely can be called spoilers
2015-11-27 16:56:57	indeedwatson	it's not really plot relevant
2015-11-27 17:00:53	Porkepikk	yeah obviously
2015-11-27 17:00:57	Porkepikk	well i have to go eat

2015-11-27 17:22:05	@Carson	I don't really know much about linux
2015-11-27 17:22:30	indeedwatson	could be, i just save several images and one gets picked at random
2015-11-27 17:22:54	@Carson	that icon in the corner looks like the ghostly music icon
2015-11-27 17:23:29	indeedwatson	i don't even know who ghostly is but you're right http://ghostly.com/wallpapers

2015-11-27 17:33:57	indeedwatson	how come
2015-11-27 17:34:09	@Carson	just not running the best as it is
2015-11-27 17:34:30	indeedwatson	it'd probably run better with a light distro
2015-11-27 17:34:43	@Carson	link?
2015-11-27 17:36:14	indeedwatson	something like lubuntu http://lubuntu.net/blog/lubuntu-1504-vivid-vervet-released which is ubuntu but with LXDE instead of unity
2015-11-27 17:36:46	indeedwatson	but you should look around which distros there are and which you think would suit you best

2015-11-27 17:38:42	@Carson	I know their are better 3rd party ones, and the new OS X one isn't that great
2015-11-27 17:39:02	@Carson	I liked the Windows 7 pull to edge snap
2015-11-27 17:39:23	@Carson	I don't mind Chan, haven't seen that much though
2015-11-27 17:39:40	indeedwatson	the thing about my desktop for example is that it's not just the visuals, moving around everywhere is different, makes windows feel primitive when i have to use it

2015-11-27 22:06:20	Porkepikk	Well ... Where can i find a better movie ? Bergman ? Jodorowsky ? Tarr ? Or can i kill myself ? :D
2015-11-27 22:07:39	RyanSmallwood2	haha, nowhere but more Tarkovsky and Tarr
2015-11-27 22:07:57	Porkepikk	This is the kind of movie that looks like it was made on another planet
2015-11-27 22:08:12	RyanSmallwood2	I dunno if you've watched any Jodorowsky, but I'd classify him different than those other 3 filmmakers
2015-11-27 22:08:40	Porkepikk	oh yeah, i've just heard of the Holy Mountain as something pretty special
2015-11-27 22:08:46	indeedwatson	it is
2015-11-27 22:08:50	indeedwatson	but in a very different way
2015-11-27 22:09:13	RyanSmallwood2	Jodorowsky appeals more to midnight movie and drug culture than arthouse
2015-11-27 22:09:17	indeedwatson	Porkepikk: have you seen solaris?
2015-11-27 22:09:21	Porkepikk	no
2015-11-27 22:09:27	Porkepikk	First Tarkovsky
2015-11-27 22:09:31	Porkepikk	i'm a virgin :3
2015-11-27 22:09:41	indeedwatson	i started with stalker too
2015-11-27 22:09:58	RyanSmallwood2	even though Jodorowsky is also very religious, I think his interest is more in obscure occult religious imagery rather than exploring the meaning of lfie
2015-11-27 22:10:29	indeedwatson	RyanSmallwood2: i think he explores the meaning of life through that, it's just that most viewers don't happen to have the same beliefs
2015-11-27 22:10:36	Porkepikk	ok, btw that was obviously anti USSR right ?
2015-11-27 22:10:57	indeedwatson	i do't think to him it's "obscure" as much as it is true to him
2015-11-27 22:11:05	indeedwatson	reminds me of alan moore in that way
2015-11-27 22:11:41	RyanSmallwood2	I feel like Jodorowsky is wrapped in his own code of imagery related to tarrot and stuff, his films are usually appreciated in a different way that he probably intended them
2015-11-27 22:11:58	indeedwatson	sure, but i don't think he cares
2015-11-27 22:12:13	indeedwatson	i mean, i don't think he'd say there's a correct way to interpret his symbolism
2015-11-27 22:12:25	RyanSmallwood2	I really like his films, I'm just trying to differentiate him from the other 3 filmmakers
2015-11-27 22:12:40	RyanSmallwood2	like I think Tarr is an atheist but he approaches similar topics as Bergman and Tarkovsky
2015-11-27 22:12:54	indeedwatson	i'd say his style is way more over the top and psychedelic
2015-11-27 22:12:58	RyanSmallwood2	yup
2015-11-27 22:13:33	RyanSmallwood2	he also much more influenced by surrealist filmmakers and genre films

2015-11-27 22:17:08	RyanSmallwood2	Porkepikk: tarkosvky had a lot of friction with the soviet government when making films, I dunno how explicitly anti-soviet he was, obviously censorship limited from doing any obvious criticism
2015-11-27 22:17:58	indeedwatson	i never got that message from it

2015-11-27 22:18:29	Porkepikk	at the end of the movie you hear the soviet union anthem
2015-11-27 22:18:32	Porkepikk	with the train
2015-11-27 22:18:52	indeedwatson	hmm hang on
2015-11-27 22:19:04	Porkepikk	hang on too, i'm sure i've heard it
2015-11-27 22:19:25	Porkepikk	OH N?O
2015-11-27 22:19:26	Porkepikk	NOPE
2015-11-27 22:19:33	Porkepikk	not soviet union anthem
2015-11-27 22:19:36	Porkepikk	sorry
2015-11-27 22:19:39	Porkepikk	get back to your seats
2015-11-27 22:19:42	RyanSmallwood2	hah
2015-11-27 22:20:13	indeedwatson	it's beethoven's 9th
2015-11-27 22:20:26	RyanSmallwood2	also any film he made would've been edited by soviet censors before released
2015-11-27 22:20:32	indeedwatson	the train plays different themes each thime iirc
2015-11-27 22:20:38	indeedwatson	at one point it's ravel's bolero
2015-11-27 22:22:57	RyanSmallwood2	Porkepikk: if you dug Stalker, you should be good to try some Tarr like Werckmeister Harmonies, but you could stick around with Tarkovsky and Bermang for a while too
2015-11-27 22:23:15	Porkepikk	Yeah i have Werckmeister Harmonies in my watchlist
2015-11-27 22:23:23	Porkepikk	And Fanny & Alexander (i think that's the title)
2015-11-27 22:25:02	RyanSmallwood2	I still haven't seen Fanny & Alexander >_<
2015-11-27 22:25:36	RyanSmallwood2	I mostly do 50s and 60s bergman
2015-11-27 22:25:49	RyanSmallwood2	and also I haven't found the 5 hours for F&A yet
2015-11-27 22:26:40	indeedwatson	i love Stalker but i couldn't get through werckmeister 
2015-11-27 22:26:44	indeedwatson	but this was years ago
2015-11-27 22:27:13	RyanSmallwood2	its not a guaranteed thing
2015-11-27 22:27:23	RyanSmallwood2	just if you love Stalker, you have a shot of digger werckmeister
2015-11-27 22:27:35	RyanSmallwood2	*digging
2015-11-27 22:27:38	indeedwatson	yeah i plan on rewatching it
2015-11-27 22:27:59	RyanSmallwood2	if he was on the fence on Stalker, I would've told him to hold off on werkmeister
2015-11-27 22:28:43	indeedwatson	i have friends who aren't cinephiles at all who liked stalker
2015-11-27 22:29:16	indeedwatson	i feel the premise makes it more accesible a bit
2015-11-27 22:29:35	RyanSmallwood2	yeah I think tarkovsky has a lot of appeal beyond cinephiles
2015-11-27 22:30:34	RyanSmallwood2	even if you're not used to slow films, a certain type of person will be interested in the visuals, ideas, and emotions
2015-11-27 22:31:14	indeedwatson	stalker, solaris and ivan's childhood probably, but mirror and andrei rublev i wouldn't think so
2015-11-27 22:32:59	RyanSmallwood2	mirror lack of straightforward narrative might put some off, but I've seen some non-cinephiles who liked it
2015-11-27 22:35:28	indeedwatson	interesting
2015-11-27 22:36:14	RyanSmallwood2	I think thought perhaps people who like other kinds of art
2015-11-27 22:36:30	RyanSmallwood2	I was at a screening and someone there said it was her favorite film, but she was a painter and didn't watch a lot of movies
2015-11-27 22:38:52	RyanSmallwood2	I feel like anyone who was up for the idea of an artfilm would enjoy it just on the strength of the visuals and the emotions in some scenes
2015-11-27 22:39:44	indeedwatson	yeah the letters that he puts in sculpting in time are from ordinary people and they say the film touched them deeply
2015-11-27 22:39:52	indeedwatson	but there's also some angry letters lol
2015-11-27 22:39:59	indeedwatson	like people got infuriated
2015-11-27 22:40:45	RyanSmallwood2	hahaha
2015-11-27 22:41:32	Porkepikk	Oh yeah btw, what i mostly like with Stalker is that every shot looks like a painting
2015-11-27 22:41:52	RyanSmallwood2	yeah, its a beautiful film
2015-11-27 22:41:55	indeedwatson	every frame a painting :)
2015-11-27 22:41:57	RyanSmallwood2	he had to shoot it twice!
2015-11-27 22:41:58	Porkepikk	And because it's slow paced, you have time to watch what's around the characters, the differents objets in the water, the vegetations etc ...
2015-11-27 22:42:05	RyanSmallwood2	the first time all the film didn't turn out
2015-11-27 22:42:09	Porkepikk	like watching a painting in a musuem
2015-11-27 22:42:29	indeedwatson	Porkepikk: yes that's something so many people miss, they just care about getting the information quckly in regards to plot and character action
2015-11-27 22:42:39	indeedwatson	and they ignore the fact that the image itself is visual information
2015-11-27 22:42:58	indeedwatson	Porkepikk: have you seen samsara/baraka? im sure you've been asked before, sry
2015-11-27 22:43:07	Porkepikk	I have the dvd next to me
2015-11-27 22:43:15	Porkepikk	gotta watch it, my mother gave it to me
2015-11-27 22:43:20	RyanSmallwood2	I dunno if I'd hold those as high as Stalker
2015-11-27 22:43:23	Porkepikk	of samsara btw, but she has baraka too
2015-11-27 22:44:35	RyanSmallwood2	Lucy re-uses some shots from samsara
2015-11-27 22:45:07	indeedwatson	RyanSmallwood2: it fits what Porkepikk said about looking at the images themselves
2015-11-27 22:45:36	indeedwatson	Porkepikk: oh yeah, and i told you to download a br rip :p
2015-11-27 22:45:44	Porkepikk	but i can't find one T_T

2015-11-27 22:46:39	RyanSmallwood2	yeah they're worth seeing for sure, I just wouldn't personally put them on the same level at Stalker
2015-11-27 22:46:42	Porkepikk	not going to waste those seeds on some boring documentary :P
2015-11-27 22:46:49	Porkepikk	oh thanks <3
2015-11-27 22:47:11	RyanSmallwood2	Koyaanisqatsi too
2015-11-27 22:47:12	Porkepikk	well stalker is a movie with plots etc, samsara is just a documentary right ?
2015-11-27 22:47:15	Porkepikk	can't really compare them
2015-11-27 22:47:22	Porkepikk	yeah have it on watchlist
2015-11-27 22:47:24	indeedwatson	it has a sort of message, but 0 dialogue
2015-11-27 22:48:00	indeedwatson	but i can say it was the best visual experience of my life
2015-11-27 22:48:01	Porkepikk	oh wait, only 2 seeds :/

2015-11-27 22:48:45	indeedwatson	but yeah you need to hone your torrent finding skills
2015-11-27 22:48:58	Porkepikk	not the issue

2015-11-27 22:49:18	Porkepikk	its' not mainstream, the internet is still mostly porn

2015-11-27 22:52:00	indeedwatson	i was telling a friend about karagarga

2015-11-27 22:55:51	indeedwatson	what's the original language?
2015-11-27 22:55:53	Porkepikk	like China Behind

2015-11-27 22:57:05	indeedwatson	ok, china behind isn't
2015-11-27 22:57:08	Porkepikk	try China behind
2015-11-27 22:58:13	RyanSmallwood2	we should screen some old French films sometime

2015-11-27 23:09:57	RyanSmallwood2	that's a good habit
2015-11-27 23:12:14	RyanSmallwood2	I need to get back in the habit of watching a movie everyday
2015-11-27 23:12:48	indeedwatson	i never had that habit

2015-11-27 23:20:10	lfl	what do you guys think about written essays which are peppered in with video examples?
2015-11-27 23:20:38	RyanSmallwood2	those work too
2015-11-27 23:20:46	lfl	imo, you could put out more written work, and therefore be more efficient, but video essays have the advantage of being entirely video, so they're accessible through thinks like youtube
2015-11-27 23:21:02	Porkepikk	I'm making a video right now
2015-11-27 23:21:05	Porkepikk	almost finished the writing
2015-11-27 23:21:16	Porkepikk	it's readable, but obviously wouldn't be interesting like that

2015-11-27 23:32:52	indeedwatson	with reviewers like yms and rlm, i watch them for movie reviews as well as for their entertainment value
2015-11-27 23:35:13	indeedwatson	Porkepik: it's really weird going back and seeing his older videos
2015-11-27 23:35:21	indeedwatson	the audio and the editing is so bad in comparison
2015-11-27 23:35:26	Porkepik	oh yeah ^^
2015-11-27 23:35:41	Porkepik	you can see the evolution with a lot of youtubers
2015-11-27 23:36:43	Porkepik	I remember watching Crossed, french videos about video game adaptations, not only you see the quality going up after every video but the guy loose weight :D
2015-11-27 23:36:47	Porkepik	at the end he is pretty skinny

2015-11-28 11:42:43	AlexJ44	haha! tarkosvky and kurosawa
2015-11-28 11:42:47	AlexJ44	i've never seen seven samurai :(
2015-11-28 11:42:51	RyanSmallwood	its good!
2015-11-28 11:42:59	AlexJ44	by the way RyanSmallwood - have you seen the assassin?
2015-11-28 11:43:37	indeedwatson	ok i read the relevant bit
2015-11-28 11:43:42	RyanSmallwood	yup yup
2015-11-28 11:44:13	AlexJ44	ok, so a couple of questions
2015-11-28 11:44:28	AlexJ44	this might be a tricky one: is it good by "itself"?
2015-11-28 11:44:46	AlexJ44	or would you recommend watching some related films to get a better grasp of it?
2015-11-28 11:45:29	RyanSmallwood	I think its good by itself in the sense that you don't need exterior knowledge to appreciate whats in it
2015-11-28 11:46:08	RyanSmallwood	its style is pretty extreme though, and other films might be better introductions to that method of making films
2015-11-28 11:46:25	Porkepikk	In a way, if the movies made him so angry, they have an effect and then a purpose
2015-11-28 11:46:40	Porkepikk	It makes you react, feel something
2015-11-28 11:46:47	AlexJ44	can you recommend some? I'm curious because sight and sound put it as best 2015 film
2015-11-28 11:46:52	Porkepikk	Which is, to me, one of the purpose of art
2015-11-28 11:46:54	RyanSmallwood	I disagree with idea that feeling something is an indication of quality
2015-11-28 11:47:04	indeedwatson	Porkepikk: i don't think that's what he was going for probably
2015-11-28 11:47:07	RyanSmallwood	otherwise I'd make a movie called kitten slaughter party and be a genius
2015-11-28 11:47:14	indeedwatson	hehe
2015-11-28 11:47:23	Porkepikk	Well not talking about quality there
2015-11-28 11:47:55	AlexJ44	kitten slaughter party hah
2015-11-28 11:47:58	Porkepikk	Idk, at the end he says he never heard Tarkovsky talks so much
2015-11-28 11:48:45	RyanSmallwood	AlexJ44: I'd recommend Like Someone in Love by Abbas Kiratostami which I think it uses similar narrative technique, but is an easier entry into that kind of filmmaking
2015-11-28 11:48:47	indeedwatson	has he seen tarkovsky before or since?
2015-11-28 11:48:54	RyanSmallwood	*Kiarostami
2015-11-28 11:49:06	AlexJ44	hum okay - i've never seen anything by him so i'm curious! thanks
2015-11-28 11:49:15	AlexJ44	and is the assassin somehow related to the whole wuxia thing?
2015-11-28 11:49:23	RyanSmallwood	very loosely
2015-11-28 11:49:48	RyanSmallwood	it has the plot and setting of a wuxia film
2015-11-28 11:50:04	RyanSmallwood	but the narrative technique is more like Hou Hsiao Hsien's other films than any other wuxia film
2015-11-28 11:50:24	AlexJ44	hmm okay. i'm also curious about that "narrative" technique
2015-11-28 11:50:35	RyanSmallwood	its just very minimal
2015-11-28 11:50:38	RyanSmallwood	mostly static camera
2015-11-28 11:50:43	RyanSmallwood	characters moving through frame
2015-11-28 11:50:45	AlexJ44	i meant the setting and the plot, though, because imdb says it's on 7th century china
2015-11-28 11:52:50	RyanSmallwood	yeah it definitely would be considered a wuxia on those terms, its just not filmed like any other wuxia films
2015-11-28 11:52:58	AlexJ44	oh, good!
2015-11-28 11:53:14	AlexJ44	i still have a touch of zen to watch, I got a bit lost on the whole wuxia thing
2015-11-28 11:53:30	AlexJ44	do you like kiarostami?
2015-11-28 11:55:04	RyanSmallwood	I've only seen a handful of his films, but Like Someone in Love was my favorite film of 2012 and one of my favorite films of all time
2015-11-28 12:25:54	indeedwatson	looks interesting

2015-11-28 12:47:10	RyanSmallwood	indeedwatson: Game of Death is a so bad its good kind of movie. Bruce lee died after filming 30 minutes of fighting, and they built a movie out of those 30 minutes with doubles who wear giant sunglasses or bike helmets

2015-11-28 13:39:52	Porkepik	If you can find it, you could screen it at Les Amis du Cinema
2015-11-28 13:40:09	RyanSmallwood	I can start downloading it
2015-11-28 13:40:18	RyanSmallwood	I have a 1 hour 10 minute Bunuel film uploaded if you want to watch that

2015-11-28 13:42:28	RyanSmallwood	give me 5 minutes to start downloading 1 armed swordsman and to set up the other screening
2015-11-28 13:43:15	Porkepik	taht's been a while pmcinern has been there
2015-11-28 13:43:21	Porkepik	like a week at least

2015-11-28 13:44:01	RyanSmallwood	I don't think anyone was at the screenings last weekend except when you kequin and I watched Death Duel
2015-11-28 13:44:26	Porkepik	:(
2015-11-28 13:44:42	Porkepik	maybe it would have been better to start by screening one or two movies and to hype the thing ?

2015-11-28 15:11:51	RyanSmallwood	probably cause its harder to skip around .mkv files cause of the key frames or whatever
2015-11-28 15:12:05	RyanSmallwood	I imagine when the player re-syncs it messes up the image for a few seconds

2015-11-28 15:46:45	gallusgallusdome	Twin Peaks is amazing for sure, but there is that rough stretch in the middle
2015-11-28 15:47:24	RyanSmallwood_	ehhh its perfect up through the end of the main storyline
2015-11-28 15:47:28	yurikuma	no spoilers havent seen twin peaks yets
2015-11-28 15:47:32	RyanSmallwood_	season 2 is mostly just wrapping up season 1 plus extra stuff
2015-11-28 15:47:39	RyanSmallwood_	*speaking vaguely on purpose*
2015-11-28 15:47:47	yurikuma	ok lol just making sure
2015-11-28 15:47:57	indeedwatson	well, obviously the wire is the assumed and obvious no1, so the debate is the 2nd best show
2015-11-28 15:48:17	gallusgallusdome	the first seven episodes of season 2 plus the finale are some of my favorite episodes ever, so it definitely evens out
2015-11-28 15:48:37	RyanSmallwood_	I still haven seen the wire yet, but its impossible for me to imagine anything better than Twin Peaks
2015-11-28 15:48:47	RyanSmallwood_	I´m sure the wire will be a great #2 when I see it
2015-11-28 15:48:53	TempSpastic	The Wire is really phenomenal

2015-11-28 15:50:06	RyanSmallwood_	actualyl #1 Twin Peaks, #2 Gilmore Girls, #2 probably The Wire
2015-11-28 15:50:12	gallusgallusdome	what about the sopranos :( no one likes the sopranos anymore

2015-11-28 15:55:52	TempSpastic	need this HBO subscription

2015-11-28 16:03:42	PorkepikBigwood	"At the Paris premiere, Luis Buñuel hid behind the screen with stones in his pockets for fear of being attacked by the confused audience. Nothing of the sort happened. In fact, the audience loved its myterious and incomprehensible plot."

2015-12-01 22:48:31	Porkepikk	soundtrack is fucking amazing, bangalter is fucking awesome
2015-12-01 22:48:43	Porkepikk	the use of color in the movie is strong
2015-12-01 22:49:49	Porkepikk	it's memento + rape + experimental filmmaking
2015-12-01 22:49:50	indeedwatson	yeah im basically waiting for an opportunity to watch it high
2015-12-01 22:50:07	Porkepikk	It's awesome honestly, very disturbing
2015-12-01 22:50:36	Porkepikk	I like when a movie shows very shocking scene and then choose an unusual choatic storytelling
2015-12-01 22:51:09	Porkepikk	the movie is really trying to make you hate it
2015-12-01 22:53:43	Porkepikk	Now i really want to watch his other movies
2015-12-01 22:53:57	RyanSmallwood	I haven't seen Love yet, but Enter The Void is less good
2015-12-01 22:54:04	RyanSmallwood	you might like it a lot though cause its weird
2015-12-01 22:54:20	Porkepikk	Yeah, hard to make something better after that
2015-12-01 22:54:26	Porkepikk	i mean, if you think it's actually good
2015-12-01 22:54:39	Porkepikk	but he really push the limit with this movie
2015-12-01 22:55:11	RyanSmallwood	"We all knew it was a serious movie we were doing but also we were doing the movie like a joke, we want to make it funny. I had the same kind of fun while portraying the rape scene with Monica Bellucci in Irréversible. I remember between the takes we would go and see the monitor and she was laughing saying, 'It looks so real. People are going to sc

2015-12-01 22:58:03	Porkepikk	now the end is really funny
2015-12-01 22:58:14	Porkepikk	won't say much
2015-12-01 22:58:18	Porkepikk	hope i didn't spoil or what

2015-12-01 23:29:05	Porkepikk	Director Gaspar Noé only had a three-page draft before the movie was shot, so all of the dialogue was improvised.
2015-12-01 23:29:07	Porkepikk	hahaha
2015-12-01 23:29:12	Porkepikk	that guy is special :D

2015-12-01 23:29:22	Porkepikk	Must be something to work on one of his movie
2015-12-01 23:29:31	RyanSmallwood	but I thought I remember reading somewhere that Irreversible was kind of a mistake
2015-12-01 23:29:48	RyanSmallwood	like he was trying to get funding for something else and the only thing he could get funding for was irreversible

2015-12-01 23:33:06	Porkepikk	Despite it being perhaps his most notable film, Noé revealed that "'Irreversible' is almost an accident." After doing "I Stand Alone," he wanted to do "Enter the Void," but he needed more money before he pursued his costly passion project and wrote a treatment for "Danger," the story that would eventually become "Love."
2015-12-01 23:34:35	RyanSmallwood	aha

2015-12-02 18:31:28	Carson_	how weird is that
2015-12-02 18:32:01	indeedwatson	very
2015-12-02 18:32:24	indeedwatson	you'll have to fix that too if you want gains :)
2015-12-02 18:33:06	Carson_	it's my biggest struggle now
2015-12-02 18:34:08	Carson_	I thought I was doing good by going to sleep early last night
2015-12-02 18:34:17	Carson_	but then i woke up at 3
2015-12-02 18:34:34	indeedwatson	what time were you planning on getting up?
2015-12-02 18:34:35	indeedwatson	6am?
2015-12-02 18:34:38	Carson_	I should have stay up till 2am or something and then slept till 12pm
2015-12-02 18:34:47	Carson_	yeah
2015-12-02 18:35:34	Carson_	and I was going to sleep an hour for my second session, because I needed a nap, was already getting tired again
2015-12-02 18:37:04	Carson_	at some point I need to fix it
2015-12-02 18:37:29	Carson_	maybe tonight I can go to bed around 5am and wake up at 11am
2015-12-02 18:42:04	indeedwatson	i don't think going to bed at 5am is gonna help much lol
2015-12-02 18:53:06	Carson_	well that's when I think I will be tired next
2015-12-02 18:53:13	Carson_	what would you do indeedwatson
2015-12-02 18:53:47	Carson_	if I go to bed early I will wake up shortly
2015-12-02 18:54:07	Carson_	I need to make sure I sleep in 1 long block or I will be tired for the rest of the day

2015-12-02 19:03:46	Porkepik	Hello
2015-12-02 19:03:55	RyanSmallwood	hiya
2015-12-02 19:05:34	Carson_	o/
2015-12-02 19:06:17	Carson_	so I watched a bit of that competitive smash documentary, was thinking why don't more games embrace the metagame?
2015-12-02 19:06:23	Carson_	like officially
2015-12-02 19:07:43	Porkepik	I watched Free to Play
2015-12-02 19:07:54	Porkepik	Not really anything interesting unless you're playing dota i think
2015-12-02 19:08:01	Porkepik	but i cried :'(
2015-12-02 19:08:10	indeedwatson	yo AlexJ44 
2015-12-02 19:08:11	Porkepik	hyhy <3
2015-12-02 19:08:19	indeedwatson	Carson_: you mean the game devs?
2015-12-02 19:08:50	AlexJ44	hello!
2015-12-02 19:09:08	indeedwatson	yes hello
2015-12-02 19:09:10	indeedwatson	how are you?
2015-12-02 19:09:23	Carson_	yeah kind of, isn't the meta game like a specific game type, like in smash it's mainly based around simple stages, 5 stock, no time, and no items
2015-12-02 19:09:29	AlexJ44	i'm good. really tired though
2015-12-02 19:09:48	AlexJ44	i went to a film festival yesterday. i watched the wolfpack which was very interesting
2015-12-02 19:09:51	indeedwatson	Carson_: because the creator specifically doesn't want SSB to be a fighting game
2015-12-02 19:10:14	indeedwatson	AlexJ44: nice
2015-12-02 19:10:17	Carson_	but the community does, and shouldn't they listen?
2015-12-02 19:10:28	indeedwatson	film festival and only watched one movie?
2015-12-02 19:10:43	indeedwatson	the competitive community is a relative minority
2015-12-02 19:10:47	Carson_	shouldn't they incorporate it instead of fans staying on old consoles, and emulators
2015-12-02 19:10:52	Carson_	yeah that's true
2015-12-02 19:11:10	indeedwatson	the case of ssb reminds me of tf2 
2015-12-02 19:11:22	Carson_	with competitive pokemon there are limited pokemon and moves to make the gameplay more fair
2015-12-02 19:11:40	indeedwatson	valve polishing csgo and dota for comp, but tf2 comp is all the community's work without any help from valve
2015-12-02 19:11:59	Carson_	I just think maybe these games should have separate section in the menu where you can access the metagame separately
2015-12-02 19:12:15	indeedwatson	yeah that would be great
2015-12-02 19:13:01	Carson_	i feel like the dev should embrace the metagame
2015-12-02 19:13:33	indeedwatson	how much did you watch?
2015-12-02 19:13:47	Carson_	me?
2015-12-02 19:13:56	indeedwatson	yeah
2015-12-02 19:14:10	Carson_	of the smash doc? I saw 1 hour of the 4 hour length
2015-12-02 19:14:13	AlexJ44	it runs for 8 days, but I won't be attending the rest
2015-12-02 19:14:18	AlexJ44	maybe saturday i'll return there
2015-12-02 19:14:29	Carson_	I saw the Wolfpack
2015-12-02 19:14:40	AlexJ44	i really liked it
2015-12-02 19:14:47	indeedwatson	well further ahead they mention EVO and that bit was quite interesting
2015-12-02 19:14:47	Carson_	so did I
2015-12-02 19:14:50	indeedwatson	but i don't wanna spoil
2015-12-02 19:14:52	Carson_	I downloaded it and then realized it was on netflix
2015-12-02 19:15:18	Carson_	I'm not going to watch the rest of the smash doc indeed,
2015-12-02 19:15:36	indeedwatson	oh
2015-12-02 19:15:48	AlexJ44	i've been wanting to watch that for a while
2015-12-02 19:15:51	indeedwatson	well does anyone else care about spoilers in it?
2015-12-02 19:16:00	indeedwatson	i'll pm you
2015-12-02 19:16:05	Carson_	okay
2015-12-02 19:16:17	Carson_	I also skipped around after the 1 hour mark
2015-12-02 19:16:27	Carson_	just to see if i could find anything interesting
2015-12-02 19:16:31	Carson_	saw some stuff with pcchris

2015-12-02 22:22:08	tomflint	ha
2015-12-02 22:22:20	tomflint	well, stuff I can't get off of usenet or another site :)
2015-12-02 22:22:26	tomflint	it does have a lot though
2015-12-02 22:22:37	Porkepik	But does everything has leechers ?
2015-12-02 22:22:51	Porkepik	have*
2015-12-02 22:23:17	tomflint	I've got a 25GB credit -- which will be handy. The site doesn't seem to be very active, unless I'm not browsing correctly
2015-12-02 22:26:13	tomflint	RyanSmallwood: is there something youve only been able to find on KG?
2015-12-02 22:28:23	RyanSmallwood	tomflint: I don't crosscheck if everything I get from there is in other places, but back when I joined there was stuff I wasn't able to find, but I didn't use usenet, I was just googling for torrents
2015-12-02 22:29:01	tomflint	its funny. everything I want requires a reseed request
2015-12-02 22:30:06	RyanSmallwood	what kind of stuff are you trying to get?
2015-12-02 22:30:41	tomflint	that last one was just an interview with Hitchcock --
2015-12-02 22:31:41	RyanSmallwood	ah yeah some of the books, tv interviews, and radio recordings don't get frequented a lot
2015-12-02 22:33:32	tomflint	have you guys been watching Fargo?
2015-12-02 22:33:41	RyanSmallwood	not everything on there is active, but as far as I'm aware it is the biggest torrent community of cinephiles (with an arthouse/classic lean), so while stuff might get shared elsewhere KG seems like the best place to check
2015-12-02 22:33:41	indeedwatson	i only watched s01
2015-12-02 22:33:51	tomflint	this season is fantastic
2015-12-02 22:34:11	Carson_	i've only seen a few episodes of season 2, been waiting so I can watch with a friend
2015-12-02 22:34:13	tomflint	it seems slow at first, but the last episode was some of the finest television I've ever watched
2015-12-02 22:34:15	indeedwatson	is it the same characters?
2015-12-02 22:34:17	Carson_	it's good to know that it picks up
2015-12-02 22:34:24	tomflint	nah, everything is new
2015-12-02 22:34:26	Carson_	no new pretty much, different time period
2015-12-02 22:34:28	indeedwatson	cool
2015-12-02 22:34:37	Carson_	well there is 1 character that is the same :)
2015-12-02 22:34:37	indeedwatson	there's stuff about the first season i didn't like
2015-12-02 22:34:47	tomflint	that episode could have been its own feature with a few added scenes
2015-12-02 22:34:47	Carson_	or two I guess
2015-12-02 22:35:00	indeedwatson	RyanSmallwood: did you check out Ash vs Evil Dead?
2015-12-02 22:35:18	RyanSmallwood	indeedwatson: not yet, doing more reading than watching recently

2015-12-02 22:35:59	Carson_	tomflint, Solverson and daughter are in season 1

2015-12-02 22:37:42	tomflint	oh wow, Carson_ -- i totally missed that
2015-12-02 22:37:50	Carson_	well from my memory that's all I can remember, unless there are some character references I missed
2015-12-02 22:38:10	Carson_	damn tom lol, funny I could see people missing it, that just watched season 2
2015-12-02 22:38:41	tomflint	its funny, I assumed that it was all fresh actors and characters ---
2015-12-02 22:38:48	indeedwatson	i'm gonna download the 1st ep
2015-12-02 22:39:25	Carson_	fans knew post season 1 that it might take place with a younger Solverson in the 70s
2015-12-02 22:39:41	Carson_	or 69 whenever
2015-12-02 22:40:08	tomflint	oh yeah
2015-12-02 22:40:16	tomflint	they've been leading to the massacre
2015-12-02 22:40:19	Carson_	there are some lines of dialogue in s1 that reference some of the events in season 2 i believe
2015-12-02 22:40:23	Carson_	yah
2015-12-02 22:40:29	tomflint	its not the same actor though, right?

2015-12-02 22:43:01	Carson_	was watching a film with his dad a little bit ago
2015-12-02 22:43:05	Carson_	can't remember what it was
2015-12-02 22:43:27	tomflint	Stagecoach?
2015-12-02 22:43:29	Carson_	never knew they were related until I looked it up of course
2015-12-02 22:43:36	Carson_	no, it wasn't one of the popular ones
2015-12-02 22:44:09	tomflint	good Lord. He had a busy career
2015-12-02 22:44:35	tomflint	65 years active
2015-12-02 22:44:54	tomflint	oh wait, 58 years active
2015-12-02 22:44:55	Carson_	it's always weird when I realize all these actors are related
2015-12-02 22:45:11	tomflint	yeah, Hollywood is quite small.
2015-12-02 22:45:46	tomflint	its like digging through the Coppola family tree
2015-12-02 22:45:52	Carson_	Jack Houston
2015-12-02 22:46:11	Carson_	only really know him from Boardwalk though
2015-12-02 22:46:28	Carson_	yeah the Coppola stuff is crazy when you first find out
2015-12-02 22:47:33	Carson_	tomflint, I'm starting to do a short-list curated TNG watch
2015-12-02 22:47:35	tomflint	like, everyone is successful.
2015-12-02 22:47:39	tomflint	ha

2015-12-02 22:48:48	Carson_	it's weird, the characters all have distinct personalities
2015-12-02 22:48:59	Carson_	makes the TOS series characters seem tame

2015-12-03 15:47:21	Porkepik	Beginning with Traces of Death II, the films feature the use of death metal and grindcore music to accompany the footage, occasionally giving it a satanic and evil feel. The original feature mostly used spooky keyboard music.
2015-12-03 15:47:23	Porkepik	Wtf
2015-12-03 15:47:29	Porkepik	using metal music for that
2015-12-03 15:47:51	Porkepik	I don't know how much i should hate the filmmaker for that
2015-12-03 15:49:03	Porkepik	And he also shows footage of a sex change ... Great ! Mixing deaths, mutilation with a sex change ! That's not transphobic at all

2015-12-03 18:41:34	Schultard	Seen the trailer for Hitchcock/Truffaut?
2015-12-03 18:41:48	Schultard	(or read the book for that matter?)
2015-12-03 18:42:11	RyanSmallwood	haven't  seen the trailer, but the book is essential reading
2015-12-03 18:42:22	indeedwatson	what's it called?
2015-12-03 18:42:25	RyanSmallwood	I really should listen to the original audio recordings instead at some point
2015-12-03 18:42:32	RyanSmallwood	Hitchcock/Truffaut
2015-12-03 18:43:21	Schultard	Was thinking of getting the book actually, a lot of people recommend it.
2015-12-03 18:44:15	Schultard	The trailer sure as hell sold it for me
2015-12-03 18:47:45	RyanSmallwood	that's weird they're making a documentary about it...
2015-12-03 18:48:30	RyanSmallwood	I'm not sure what the point is beyond it being cool to hear modern filmmakers talk about its influence and I guess see the discussion matched up with some clips for people who haven't see a lot of  hitchcock yet...
2015-12-03 18:48:56	RyanSmallwood	I guess its probably aimed at getting people who haven't watched a lot of hitchcock yet, to get them to study film closer...
2015-12-03 18:48:57	Schultard	Probably, yeah
2015-12-03 18:50:51	Schultard	Luckily for me they did. I'd never even heard of the book or the interview between the two before
2015-12-03 18:51:09	indeedwatson	i should probably watch some truffaut
2015-12-03 18:51:48	RyanSmallwood	I feel like anyone who gets into reading books on film will come across it pretty early on
2015-12-03 18:53:41	Schultard	Maybe, but the documentary (which IMDB displayed on their front page) will probably put it in the vicinity of a lot of people who has yet to discover it.
2015-12-03 18:54:42	Schultard	Yeezes, actually got to use the word 'vicinity'.
2015-12-03 18:55:05	RyanSmallwood	yeah, know I think it will definitely reach people
2015-12-03 18:55:24	RyanSmallwood	I'm sure there are people who know of hitchcock but maybe haven't watch a lot of films
2015-12-03 18:55:27	RyanSmallwood	or don't read about films
2015-12-03 18:55:33	RyanSmallwood	something like this will be awesome for them
2015-12-03 18:55:58	RyanSmallwood	depending on how many interviews there are it will also be interesting to hear the influence the book had
2015-12-03 18:56:26	RyanSmallwood	cause like that was the start of there being books written about film directors and stuff (discounting like technical trade journals and stuff)
2015-12-03 18:56:41	RyanSmallwood	so it is kind of cool to learn about how reading about film influenced future filmmakers
2015-12-03 18:57:11	RyanSmallwood	I kind of hope it goes more into the influence of the book than just giving a summary of it
2015-12-03 18:57:12	Schultard	Yeah. Kinda stoked for it now,
2015-12-03 18:58:02	Schultard	You've read it, right?

2015-12-04 00:04:07	indeedwatson	tldr?
2015-12-04 00:07:17	RyanSmallwood	there were a lot of focus issues and they played the second half in digital
2015-12-04 00:07:37	RyanSmallwood	I kind of skimmed but I think the reviewer said they preferred the look of the digital to the 70mm projection
2015-12-04 00:08:53	indeedwatson	i thought there wasn't a noticeable difference between digital and film
2015-12-04 00:08:59	indeedwatson	or is that just with 35mm

2015-12-04 00:17:38	indeedwatson	but idk if the same applies to 70mm 
2015-12-04 00:17:42	indeedwatson	compared to 4k
2015-12-04 00:18:09	RyanSmallwood	I've seen a bunch of movies in 70mm
2015-12-04 00:18:24	RyanSmallwood	it looks beautiful but I wouldn't swear to you it looks any better than 35 or digital
2015-12-04 00:22:37	lotsoftuna	yeah
2015-12-04 00:22:42	lotsoftuna	I saw Inherent Vice in 70mm
2015-12-04 00:22:49	lotsoftuna	additionally, high
2015-12-04 00:22:53	lotsoftuna	what a fucking mess of a movie
2015-12-04 00:22:58	lotsoftuna	so incoherent, but I get why it's good
2015-12-04 00:23:06	lotsoftuna	just very confusing, especialyl when one is high
2015-12-04 00:23:13	thewillmatic__	i saw inherent vice on my shitty laptop screen
2015-12-04 00:23:22	lotsoftuna	but it looked really good, especialyl compared to the screening of Moonrise Kingdom 2 nights before in 35mm
2015-12-04 00:23:29	lotsoftuna	That was kinda grainy and stuff, but still greatr
2015-12-04 00:24:54	Porkepik	Am i the only one who got the story ?
2015-12-04 00:25:08	Porkepik	I thought i was easy, i miss no messed up timeline
2015-12-04 00:25:22	Porkepik	characters can be easily tell apart
2015-12-04 00:25:28	Porkepik	and it's just a simple story actually

2015-12-04 00:32:20	indeedwatson	i didn't find it that confusing
2015-12-04 00:32:54	indeedwatson	the only confusing thing is too many character names out of nowhere
2015-12-04 00:33:16	Porkepik	yeah, but very quickly you start noticing who is important
2015-12-04 00:33:20	Porkepik	and you forget the rest
2015-12-04 00:33:29	Porkepik	like the sister of the nazi, you forget her quickly enough
2015-12-04 00:37:04	Porkepik	There is 2 "Casino Royale"
2015-12-04 00:37:12	Porkepik	so it's a remake, didn't know
2015-12-04 00:37:16	Porkepik	there are*
2015-12-04 00:39:22	RyanSmallwood	I think someone else had bought the right before the james bond series
2015-12-04 00:39:42	RyanSmallwood	and then when the james bond series started,the person with the casino royale rights made a parody of james bond out of them
2015-12-04 00:40:06	RyanSmallwood	so the new movie is the first official adaptation of the book in the james bond series, but the book has been adapted before
2015-12-04 00:40:25	RyanSmallwood	adapting a book that's been adapted before =/= remake in my book
2015-12-04 00:41:50	Porkepik	Yeah, never was interested in the james bond i must say
2015-12-04 00:42:09	Porkepik	i watch some old ones, but i was bored most of the time :P
2015-12-04 00:42:52	Porkepik	seems like there is no character development in those movies, like no reason for me to like the hero from the beginning and care for what is about to happen
2015-12-04 00:43:02	RyanSmallwood	I need to watch them all because they are a big cultural reference point
2015-12-04 00:43:07	Porkepik	but i watched a very long time ago
2015-12-04 00:43:12	RyanSmallwood	lots of "jane bond" films made in HK in the late 60s
2015-12-04 00:43:48	Porkepik	well i watched GoldenEye and Goldfinger
2015-12-04 00:44:01	RyanSmallwood	heh
2015-12-04 00:44:58	Porkepik	but i mostly remember the video game :P
2015-12-04 00:45:08	Porkepik	when the boyfriend of my older sister bring his N64
2015-12-04 00:45:15	Porkepik	that was fun, cool game
2015-12-04 00:46:04	RyanSmallwood	I liked reading through Film Crit Hulk's huge film by film review of the James Bond series

2015-12-04 00:52:13	Porkepik	Well, i know people often don't really like the movie cause the main character is a dick
2015-12-04 00:52:30	Porkepik	but i din't mind it, sure he is, but the direction of this movie is fucking gold
2015-12-04 00:52:47	Porkepik	I can see why it had so much influence on cinema
2015-12-04 00:53:18	Porkepik	so many good ideas, nothing really that original but still really well apply
2015-12-04 00:53:47	RyanSmallwood	have you watched any other godard yet?
2015-12-04 00:53:51	Porkepik	no
2015-12-04 00:54:05	RyanSmallwood	I have somewhat mixed feelings about him
2015-12-04 00:54:16	RyanSmallwood	Breathless is his most straightforward film and for a lot of people their favorite
2015-12-04 00:54:34	RyanSmallwood	a lot of people who don't like godard overall are still Breathless fans
2015-12-04 00:56:29	Porkepik	but why don't they like him ?
2015-12-04 00:56:35	Porkepik	I should do some research
2015-12-04 00:56:40	Porkepik	and watch his movies before
2015-12-04 00:56:59	RyanSmallwood	he puts in lots of obscure references
2015-12-04 00:57:02	RyanSmallwood	and switches style a lot
2015-12-04 00:57:22	Porkepik	i saw there was some communism reference at some point :P
2015-12-04 00:57:38	Porkepik	but that doesn't surprise me, already knew him for that
2015-12-04 00:57:54	RyanSmallwood	he references communism a lot, but I don't think that's his philosophy until after 68
2015-12-04 00:58:11	RyanSmallwood	in the 60s he was often accused by being apolitical and bringing up important issues without taking a stance on them
2015-12-04 00:59:23	RyanSmallwood	I've been reading up on him a lot recently
2015-12-04 00:59:37	RyanSmallwood	I don't know if I 100% agree with his method of making films, but there are always things I like about his films
2015-12-04 01:05:43	Porkepik	"Realizing that films DO NOT NEED plots."
2015-12-04 01:05:46	Porkepik	somehow i agree with that
2015-12-04 01:05:58	Porkepik	is it one of his controversial opinion on filmmaking ?

2015-12-04 22:19:08	RyanSmallwood	definitely
2015-12-04 22:19:28	RyanSmallwood	Rick Altman did a lot of interesting research into genre and how movies were marketed
2015-12-04 22:19:43	Pmcinern	Rick atlman, you say.
2015-12-04 22:19:46	RyanSmallwood	and most hollywood studios didn't use a consistent genre system

2015-12-04 22:51:46	uguuuuu	i don't like it
2015-12-04 22:52:51	indeedwatson	why
2015-12-04 22:53:08	uguuuuu	creates artifacts, doesn't look natural
2015-12-04 22:53:18	uguuuuu	isn't the intended framerate of the source
2015-12-04 22:53:42	indeedwatson	the anime example doesn't look bad
2015-12-04 22:54:47	uguuuuu	on real video you'll get a lot of artifacts on hair and fingers
2015-12-04 22:55:03	RyanSmallwood	anime is probably easier for software like that, less detail and 3D movement
2015-12-04 22:55:09	indeedwatson	i should download the hobbit in 48fps to see if i notice the soap opera effect
2015-12-04 22:55:35	RyanSmallwood	I got used to the hobbit in 48fps after a while
2015-12-04 22:55:38	uguuuuu	it's the equivalent of leaving all those frame interpolation settings on on TVs
2015-12-04 22:55:46	uguuuuu	which also looks weird, but some people don't notice it
2015-12-04 22:56:02	uguuuuu	but then again lots of people watch 4:3 stretched to 16:9 and don't notice
2015-12-04 22:57:27	uguuuuu	one reason it might work better on anime is that motion is either animated on 2s/3s or it's a smooth predictable pan
2015-12-04 23:22:35	indeedwatson	Porkepik: oh you were watching the filmmakerIQ video about fps earlier
2015-12-04 23:33:31	indeedwatson	is there an edit of the hobbit films down into 1?
2015-12-04 23:34:26	RyanSmallwood	I'd like to see an edit just following bilbo and the dwarves and maybe cutting out most of the 3rd movie
2015-12-04 23:36:46	indeedwatson	i've only seen the 1st
2015-12-04 23:36:58	indeedwatson	but the obvious thing would be to cut the romance
2015-12-04 23:37:54	RyanSmallwood	yeah, I think they added that so it wouldn't be all dudes everywhere in the film
2015-12-04 23:38:03	RyanSmallwood	but its kind of a re-hash of stuff from LotR

2015-12-04 23:57:10	Porkepik	This one surprised me
2015-12-04 23:58:14	Porkepik	I especially loved the portayal of Paul's friend, the one who doesn't seem to have a real job
2015-12-04 23:58:20	Porkepik	I looked like some "devil"
2015-12-04 23:58:54	Porkepik	some sort of representation of the debauchery Paul takes part in
2015-12-04 23:59:21	RyanSmallwood	Claude Chabrol doesn't get as much attention as the other wavers (at least in the english speaking areas), but I really dig the cousins
2015-12-04 23:59:33	RyanSmallwood	I have to watch more of his stuff
2015-12-04 23:59:50	Porkepik	Everytime he is there, he is causing all the trouble, trying to get the girl with the cousin ... the parties etc ...
2015-12-05 00:00:07	RyanSmallwood	heh
2015-12-05 00:01:07	Porkepik	And the end was epic, some people call him the french "Hitchcock" no idea if it's a legit name for him but you can see how those filmmakers were influenced by american cinema
2015-12-05 00:01:34	indeedwatson	for a sec i thought you were talking about Les Cousins Dangereux, that fake movie in Arrested Development
2015-12-05 00:01:53	Porkepik	haha
2015-12-05 00:02:14	Porkepik	never watched it
2015-12-05 00:02:24	Porkepik	but i always see references on reddit
2015-12-05 00:02:54	RyanSmallwood	Henri-Georges Clouzot is the "French Hitchcock", Claude Chabrol was influenced by hitchcock and some of his films are considered to be imitating hitchcock's style

2015-12-05 00:05:30	RyanSmallwood	people get riled up over stupid stuff
2015-12-05 00:06:06	indeedwatson	70mm = 8k+
2015-12-05 00:06:06	indeedwatson	IMAX = 2k or 4k
2015-12-05 00:06:07	uguuuuu	tfw you're op and feel the need to respond to every post
2015-12-05 00:06:10	indeedwatson	is that right?
2015-12-05 00:06:25	uguuuuu	IMAX is 70mm turned on its side
2015-12-05 00:06:32	uguuuuu	so even more resolution than regular 65/70mm
2015-12-05 00:06:33	indeedwatson	from bordwell's book, i thought 70mm = 4k
2015-12-05 00:06:40	indeedwatson	yeah i know that
2015-12-05 00:06:52	indeedwatson	but it sounds like the opposite of what was said there
2015-12-05 00:07:49	uguuuuu	i guess they're talking about digital IMAX, which is a different thing?
2015-12-05 00:08:16	indeedwatson	but is normal 70mm the equivalent of 4k?
2015-12-05 00:08:19	RyanSmallwood	35mm is usually scanned at 4k to get all the detail in restorations
2015-12-05 00:08:21	indeedwatson	i mean 8k
2015-12-05 00:08:37	indeedwatson	i feel lied to by david bordwell
2015-12-05 00:08:40	RyanSmallwood	I don't think there's an easy exact equivalence
2015-12-05 00:08:41	indeedwatson	or maybe i read it wrong
2015-12-05 00:08:53	uguuuuu	even 35mm can have detail beyond 2K or 3K
2015-12-05 00:09:28	RyanSmallwood	the thing about film is that because the grains have a different pattern in each frame, in motion there's more detail than a single frame has
2015-12-05 00:09:31	uguuuuu	70mm is usually scanned at 8K though
2015-12-05 00:10:35	RyanSmallwood	I think 4k and 70mm and all that is way past the detail our eye sees though
2015-12-05 00:11:16	indeedwatson	doesn't that depend on screen size
2015-12-05 00:11:31	RyanSmallwood	probably

2015-12-05 00:26:24	Porkepik	Hello puddy
2015-12-05 00:26:26	puddy	the two hosts have a discussion about a film and talk about it in detail
2015-12-05 00:26:38	puddy	hi Porkepik
2015-12-05 00:26:48	RyanSmallwood	is it more modern films, or do they discuss older films too?
2015-12-05 00:26:51	puddy	the discussion iseems thoughtful and considerate
2015-12-05 00:26:57	puddy	both
2015-12-05 00:27:05	Porkepik	And good night people
2015-12-05 00:27:14	RyanSmallwood	goodnight
2015-12-05 00:27:16	puddy	they usually do a contemporary film in the beginning of the ep, and do an older film midway thru
2015-12-05 00:27:31	indeedwatson	i like them, but I don't like how much they seem to talk about mainstream movies
2015-12-05 00:27:36	puddy	sometimes they have an episode which revisits an older film which is considered a classic
2015-12-05 00:27:54	puddy	indeedwatson i think that's just the nature of the movie podcasting business
2015-12-05 00:28:22	indeedwatson	i guess, but it makes me want to go and listen to specific episodes, rather than subscribe and listen to all
2015-12-05 00:28:23	puddy	many people are interested in discussing mainstream films but it's hard to get listeners for obscure/foreign films

2015-12-05 00:36:24	indeedwatson	im surprised at some of the choices tho
2015-12-05 00:36:28	indeedwatson	like kill bill 2
2015-12-05 00:36:30	RyanSmallwood	best 25 for filmspotting or best 25 of any podcast?
2015-12-05 00:37:30	RyanSmallwood	I really like Kill Bill, though I refuse to distinguish between 1 and 2, I always watch them together
2015-12-05 00:38:20	puddy	guessing you're talking about slate's 25 podcast episode list
2015-12-05 00:38:29	puddy	I like Kill Bill vol.2
2015-12-05 00:38:45	puddy	I don't know how I would even start to compile a best of 2000-2009 list
2015-12-05 00:39:40	uguuuuu	step 1: copy paste imdb top movies of 2000-2009
2015-12-05 00:39:43	puddy	and I think Kill Bill vol.1 and 2 share the same theme but their tone seems a bit different
2015-12-05 00:39:56	uguuuuu	step 2: post it to /r/movies
2015-12-05 00:40:09	indeedwatson	i dont think ive seen enough movies from the 2000's
2015-12-05 00:41:37	RyanSmallwood	kill bill 1 and 2 do have different tones, but they're the same story so I prefer to consider them as a whole rather than separately
2015-12-05 00:42:47	puddy	i see

2015-12-05 12:40:53	Porkepik	There is Bruce Lee fighting, it's hard to stop watching, but i'm spoiling myself :/
2015-12-05 12:41:10	RyanSmallwood	heh
2015-12-05 12:41:18	RyanSmallwood	tough to find when a movie is starting
2015-12-05 12:41:23	RyanSmallwood	now there's no schedule
2015-12-05 12:41:28	RyanSmallwood	just movies playing

2015-12-05 12:42:01	RyanSmallwood	90% of the movie is waiting for bruce lee to start fighting
2015-12-05 12:42:03	Porkepik	ok, yeah forgot yesterday to talk about that with pmc
2015-12-05 12:42:16	Porkepik	asking to get back to the old schedule, it was fun to watch movies together
2015-12-05 12:42:17	RyanSmallwood	yeah, he took off pretty fast
2015-12-05 12:42:21	Porkepik	now it's empty most of the time :(
2015-12-05 12:42:36	RyanSmallwood	some people were on last night

2015-12-05 12:45:13	RyanSmallwood	there's a bunch of fights where the people have to pretend not to be fighting
2015-12-05 12:45:31	RyanSmallwood	so like really elaborate scenes of people at a tea tasting ceremony trying to kill each other while being polite
2015-12-05 12:45:34	indeedwatson	anyone seen this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2G7oeyOsfSg
2015-12-05 12:45:45	puddy	ah so like kungfu comedy
2015-12-05 12:45:46	RyanSmallwood	its very funny and has some of the most amazing choreography in any kung fu film ever
2015-12-05 12:45:59	RyanSmallwood	its very easily one of the top 10 kung fu films
2015-12-05 12:46:07	Porkepik	Hyyyype :D
2015-12-05 12:46:13	puddy	i feel so ignorant
2015-12-05 12:46:14	Porkepik	be careful, you hyped me hard now
2015-12-05 12:46:20	RyanSmallwood	its not possible to overhype Dirty Ho
2015-12-05 12:46:23	puddy	i like bruce lee and jackie chan but barely know the rest of the genre
2015-12-05 12:46:25	RyanSmallwood	you haven't seen anything like Dirty Ho
2015-12-05 12:46:48	Porkepik	Kung Fu New Wave !

2015-12-05 12:50:21	RyanSmallwood	if people are around I'd like to organize a group for the Dirty Ho screening after that
2015-12-05 12:50:35	RyanSmallwood	(or we can try a different time if people prefer, but Dirt Ho is the best)
2015-12-05 12:50:50	Porkepik	well i have to do my homework
2015-12-05 12:51:00	Porkepik	or Ryan-senpai won't be happy, so Avventura is on my list
2015-12-05 12:51:07	Porkepik	then Dirty Ho i guess if i'm able to be there
2015-12-05 12:51:17	RyanSmallwood	I can hang out for the King Boxer screening, but I'll probably be doing other stuff cause I've seen it a bunch of times
2015-12-05 12:52:38	RyanSmallwood	king boxer is starting in 3 minutes if anyone wants to see
2015-12-05 12:52:55	RyanSmallwood	Kill Bill has a lot of references from King Boxer

2015-12-05 12:56:35	RyanSmallwood	I saw some chat last night of people complaining about dubs, not sure which movies are dubbed :/
2015-12-05 12:56:42	RyanSmallwood	if dirty ho is dubbed, then that really sucks
2015-12-05 12:57:00	Porkepik	oh yeah ... well we could screen it at Les Amis du Cinema at worst :D
2015-12-05 12:57:09	RyanSmallwood	true true
2015-12-05 12:59:04	RyanSmallwood	well King Boxer is a dub
2015-12-05 12:59:10	RyanSmallwood	and I've got a bad feeling dirty ho is too
2015-12-05 12:59:11	RyanSmallwood	:/
2015-12-05 13:01:09	puddy	I uh.. acquired King Boxer last night apparently non-dubbed version
2015-12-05 13:01:20	RyanSmallwood	now I kind of don't want to try and drum up a big group for Dirty Ho, cause if will be really anti-climactic if it ends up being dubbed
2015-12-05 13:05:47	RyanSmallwood	maybe at some point I'll organize a few HK screenings for Les Amis Du Cinema

2015-12-05 13:32:07	lotsoftuna	sigh
2015-12-05 13:33:48	RyanSmallwood	kind of annoying that star wars, hateful eight and the Revenant are coming out so close together. Hope the star wars audiences have died down a bit after a week
2015-12-05 13:34:55	indeedwatson	RyanSmallwood: any examples?
2015-12-05 13:37:09	RyanSmallwood	I'm not an expert on ozu yet (which is why I haven't made an ozu video essay myself yet) but I know Bordwell talks about myths that Ozu always uses the same style and points out some evolution in his cinematography over his films, and I believe he also takes issue with the idea of the "the tatami shot" which people often say Ozu is using
2015-12-05 13:37:44	RyanSmallwood	and this is not in Bordwell, but I find his point that "for ozu only what is in the frame is important" to be a weird way of appraising a film or describing ozu's style
2015-12-05 13:40:45	RyanSmallwood	sorry if I'm always being a diva complaining about other video essays and stuff and never making any of my own
2015-12-05 13:40:55	indeedwatson	what do you mean "people say"? i mean the shots are there :p
2015-12-05 13:40:58	indeedwatson	lol it's ok
2015-12-05 13:41:13	indeedwatson	im just asking cause I dont really like this channel criswell
2015-12-05 13:41:23	indeedwatson	at least in comparison with the other essayists
2015-12-05 13:42:38	RyanSmallwood	there's a lot of cliche's that get circulated around by directors that people take as gospel if they haven't read any serious film theory or seen that many films
2015-12-05 13:43:03	RyanSmallwood	like a lot of times Ozu and Mizoguchi are discussed as giving a "Japanese POV"
2015-12-05 13:43:06	RyanSmallwood	like that Mizoguchi
2015-12-05 13:43:19	RyanSmallwood	's camera moves in and out of rooms like a Japanese person moving through their sliding doors
2015-12-05 13:43:30	RyanSmallwood	and that Ozu is the POV of a Japanese person sitting down on a tatami mat
2015-12-05 13:43:50	RyanSmallwood	as if there's like a Japanese way of shooting people
2015-12-05 13:44:17	indeedwatson	well it is a japanese way of sitting :p
2015-12-05 13:44:21	RyanSmallwood	and Bordwell takes the time to go through all the different stylistic options Japanese directors of the period employ to debunk these ideas, instead of cherry picking examples from a few auters
2015-12-05 13:45:33	RyanSmallwood	I'm probably being overly harsh on Criswell
2015-12-05 13:45:52	RyanSmallwood	I just like him to break things apart more and contrast Ozu to other Japanese filmmakers of his day
2015-12-05 13:47:31	RyanSmallwood	I like Tony Zhou's essays a lot, i haven't taken to most of the other channels I've seen
2015-12-05 13:48:46	RyanSmallwood	anyways I'll try to complain less
2015-12-05 13:49:04	RyanSmallwood	when I've finished my research I'll put together essays my way and I'll see if people find my arguments convincing or not

2015-12-06 12:15:26	keqin	nice AlexJ44, recently?
2015-12-06 12:15:27	keqin	the country basically runs on a vertical studio system
2015-12-06 12:15:33	keqin	like hollywood 1950s
2015-12-06 12:15:42	keqin	so the production company Galaxy owns the theaters as well
2015-12-06 12:15:52	keqin	but their main competitor is CJ, a korean-owned company
2015-12-06 12:15:54	AlexJ44	kind of
2015-12-06 12:16:01	AlexJ44	this year
2015-12-06 12:16:06	keqin	in general, there is a lot of investment from Korea to Vietnam
2015-12-06 12:16:12	keqin	and CJ is their stake in the movie industry
2015-12-06 12:16:23	AlexJ44	i watched ex machina yesterday
2015-12-06 12:16:25	keqin	they do a lot of remakes of South Korean movies for the Vietnamese audience
2015-12-06 12:16:29	AlexJ44	and all I could think of was solaris
2015-12-06 12:17:16	RyanSmallwood	heh, I also need to learn more about South Korean cinema
2015-12-06 12:17:27	RyanSmallwood	besides some of the really famous stuff thats known over here
2015-12-06 12:17:27	keqin	i was talking w a guy who works in the industry as an AD, and he tells me that the ppl who do go see movies in Vietnam don't necesarily care for the movies that come from hollywood
2015-12-06 12:18:00	keqin	yeah, South Korea is doing really good stuff lately!
2015-12-06 12:18:17	keqin	AlexJ44 I havent seen Solaris haha but i wouldnt imagine it to be the same as ex machina
2015-12-06 12:18:30	AlexJ44	have you seen ex machina?
2015-12-06 12:18:36	keqin	yup
2015-12-06 12:18:39	keqin	i saw it on a plane it was cool
2015-12-06 12:19:09	AlexJ44	"...to my best knowledge, the book was not dedicated to erotic problems of people in outer space... As Solaris' author I shall allow myself to repeat that I only wanted to create a vision of a human encounter with something that certainly exists, in a mighty manner perhaps, but cannot be reduced to human concepts, ideas or images. This is why the book was entitled "Solaris" and not "Love in Outer Space"
2015-12-06 12:19:14	AlexJ44	thats a quote from the solaris book author
2015-12-06 12:19:55	keqin	so is this related to the ex machina love w robot thing
2015-12-06 12:20:12	AlexJ44	sort of, yes
2015-12-06 12:20:29	AlexJ44	I could really draw some parallels with both films
2015-12-06 12:20:53	AlexJ44	i'm catching up on 2015 films now, because I'm supposed to do a write up on my favorite 2015
2015-12-06 12:21:06	keqin	oh nice nice
2015-12-06 12:21:10	Card74	Stanislaw Lem was great, I binged through his scifi books when I was a kid
2015-12-06 12:21:32	keqin	damn, 2015 is over already?
2015-12-06 12:21:45	keqin	i sitll remember the 2014 lists
2015-12-06 12:21:53	keqin	boyhood
2015-12-06 12:21:54	keqin	lol
2015-12-06 12:22:33	RyanSmallwood	gotta cram in a chance to see star wars, the revenant, and hateful eight right before 2016
2015-12-06 12:22:40	AlexJ44	do you recommend solaris' book Card74 ?
2015-12-06 12:23:05	RyanSmallwood	probably other important 2015 films I missed because I'm out of it this year
2015-12-06 12:23:16	Card74	yes, practically evrything he wrote was damn good
2015-12-06 12:23:41	AlexJ44	well, i'm going to see mad max now
2015-12-06 12:23:44	AlexJ44	hope it's good

2015-12-06 12:24:24	Card74	the finnish translations are long out of print, sadly

2015-12-06 12:35:35	RyanSmallwood	heh
2015-12-06 12:35:54	RyanSmallwood	I think I may have mentioned it before, its the book on how French philosophy got used and distorted in American Universities

2015-12-06 12:38:06	Porkepik	Have you read some sartre ?$
2015-12-06 12:39:09	RyanSmallwood	not yet, I have to read Hegel, then Heidegger, then understand how Kojève taught their ideas in France, before I can even approach Sartre

2015-12-06 12:51:11	Porkepik	you read it in french ?
2015-12-06 12:51:55	RyanSmallwood	I tried, but its not a subject I'm used to so I had to read the English version to make sure I was understanding his arguments precisely
2015-12-06 12:52:01	RyanSmallwood	I normally can read film books in french

2015-12-06 12:54:10	RyanSmallwood	its a very interesting topic, and its why I'm curious to learn more about modern French Philosophy
2015-12-06 12:54:54	RyanSmallwood	American Philosophers think the French philosophy taught in our literary departments is the same French philosophy still taught in France
2015-12-06 12:54:54	Porkepik	yeah, btw don't really listen to what i say about BHL, but most french don't like him. Obviously you're gonna make your own opinion of him
2015-12-06 12:55:22	Porkepik	i hate him more for his stupid commentary on every political decisions in France than his books
2015-12-06 12:55:31	RyanSmallwood	heh
2015-12-06 12:56:30	Porkepik	That's the french philosophy taught in USA ?
2015-12-06 12:56:56	Porkepik	they tend to ignore the modern philosophy ?
2015-12-06 12:58:02	RyanSmallwood	well our Philosophy departments have philosophers who call themselves Analytic philosophers, who reject all German/French philosophers after Kant
2015-12-06 12:58:12	Porkepik	Oh ok
2015-12-06 12:59:37	RyanSmallwood	but in our literature departments, and film departments pre-Bordwell, they use philosophical ideas from old French philsophers like Foucault, Derrida, Deleuze, and Lacan

2015-12-06 13:04:39	RyanSmallwood	Bordwell critiqued a lot of old film theory
2015-12-06 13:04:44	RyanSmallwood	and I started with Bordwell

2015-12-06 13:05:44	RyanSmallwood	but now I'm learning that Bordwell's critique of film theory and Analytic Philosophy's critique of "Continental Philosophy" is more complicated because the target they thought they were attacking isn't unified

2015-12-06 13:22:34	Porkepik	but honestly, not many of them :/

2015-12-06 13:23:32	Porkepik	yeah, we got some great times with philosophy then not much
2015-12-06 13:24:17	RyanSmallwood	do philosophers like Judith Butler or Slavoj Žižek get much attention there?
2015-12-06 13:25:06	indeedwatson	i like zizek
2015-12-06 13:25:13	indeedwatson	dont know butler

2015-12-06 13:26:27	Porkepik	Don't know if zizek is getting attention in France, but likely more than Butler
2015-12-06 13:27:18	RyanSmallwood	heh, in my book it said when Butler was translated into French it was very poorly received over there
2015-12-06 13:29:24	Porkepik	She seems to focus a lot on USA foreign policy no ?
2015-12-06 13:29:33	Porkepik	Might be the reason why french people might not be that interested
2015-12-06 13:30:12	RyanSmallwood	well she also is big in feminist and queer theory
2015-12-06 13:30:22	indeedwatson	oh i thought she was like zizek that she said stuff about film
2015-12-06 13:30:42	Porkepik	oh yeah saw that, she only made one book on 9/11 i think
2015-12-06 13:31:11	Porkepik	yeah, don't see many french reading about feminism and queer (not that it's not interesting)
2015-12-06 13:31:36	Porkepik	but people don't focus on those subjects, especially because it's already talked a lot in the mainstream media
2015-12-06 13:32:33	RyanSmallwood	I was grouping them together as "Continental Philosophers" IE: influenced by 60s/70s French philsophy
2015-12-06 13:33:21	RyanSmallwood	Butler gets criticized a lot of for using lots of Jargon and not having much influenced outside univiersities
2015-12-06 13:33:40	RyanSmallwood	Zizek seems to try to make his ideas more accessible to general audiences

2015-12-08 11:54:39	Porkepikk	Thanks, will check it out
2015-12-08 11:54:43	AlexJ44	i'm thinking of writing an article on watching cinema, regarding the physical space of where you can watch it
2015-12-08 11:54:44	muskrat	yw
2015-12-08 11:54:50	AlexJ44	let me see if I can more specific
2015-12-08 11:55:17	AlexJ44	I think we all watch films on our laptops
2015-12-08 11:55:37	indeedwatson	not me
2015-12-08 11:55:42	muskrat	speak for yourself buddy
2015-12-08 11:55:42	AlexJ44	and watching it on a proper screen is incredibly different
2015-12-08 11:55:47	muskrat	lol
2015-12-08 11:55:54	AlexJ44	okay - we have all watched films on our laptops
2015-12-08 11:56:01	AlexJ44	cheeky bastards :(
2015-12-08 11:56:04	indeedwatson	i never owned a laptop :)
2015-12-08 11:56:05	Porkepikk	I watch it on a computer not a laptop, is that a proper screen ? :P
2015-12-08 11:56:14	muskrat	AlexJ44, just kidding
2015-12-08 11:56:25	AlexJ44	well it's still not a proper cinema screen
2015-12-08 11:56:38	Porkepikk	Dunno, don t mind it
2015-12-08 11:56:41	indeedwatson	obviously but it's much better
2015-12-08 11:56:45	indeedwatson	if you have a decent screen
2015-12-08 11:57:20	AlexJ44	so, are there any directors who have spoken about it? or filmmaking related people?
2015-12-08 11:57:37	Porkepikk	David Lynch but that was about phones
2015-12-08 11:57:49	indeedwatson	do you have a link Porkepikk 
2015-12-08 11:58:16	Porkepikk	Anyway, i have a good screen. I think people focus too much on that. I'm poor and sometimes i don't like when people think i have a choice
2015-12-08 11:58:42	Porkepikk	I would love to go the cinema or buy better gear, but in that case i challenge anyone to do it with the budget i have
2015-12-08 11:58:43	AlexJ44	exactly, we don't really have a choice
2015-12-08 11:58:45	AlexJ44	that's my point
2015-12-08 11:58:58	indeedwatson	im poor too
2015-12-08 11:59:08	AlexJ44	I think cinema really depends on the medium it is conveyed
2015-12-08 11:59:17	indeedwatson	and i live in argentina, makes it 10x worse
2015-12-08 11:59:42	AlexJ44	with books, that's not even a problem - letters are letters everywhere, unless you're getting a really terrible copy
2015-12-08 11:59:52	Porkepikk	https://youtu.be/wKiIroiCvZ0
2015-12-08 11:59:58	indeedwatson	AlexJ44: but there's also the argument that a movie is good regardless of screen size
2015-12-08 12:00:03	Porkepikk	It s a montage tho :P
2015-12-08 12:00:05	AlexJ44	of course
2015-12-08 12:00:07	Porkepikk	With the iphone ad music
2015-12-08 12:00:14	AlexJ44	but I mean the experience
2015-12-08 12:00:23	indeedwatson	Gravity, I enjoyed it on imax a lot, but i wouldn't have liked it much on my computer
2015-12-08 12:00:36	AlexJ44	exactly!
2015-12-08 12:00:57	AlexJ44	there's the objective film, which is the film itself, then the subjective, which is where and how you watch it
2015-12-08 12:01:08	AlexJ44	and that defines your experience with it
2015-12-08 12:01:13	indeedwatson	i fucking love his hair
2015-12-08 12:01:25	AlexJ44	if, as lynch says, you watch a film on your phone instead of a cinema, you're obviously goijng to have very different experiences
2015-12-08 12:01:30	Porkepikk	Yep he is fucking awesome
2015-12-08 12:03:25	AlexJ44	so, is there any article you guys have in mind? or a specific director or film person who has made a stance on that?
2015-12-08 12:04:59	Porkepikk	No, don't know any
2015-12-08 12:05:14	indeedwatson	me neither
2015-12-08 12:06:33	AlexJ44	haha, i'm reading someone who says cinema's should be turned into Private Screening Rooms
2015-12-08 12:06:53	AlexJ44	where you choose the film and who to attend with, and people pay for their ticket lol
2015-12-08 12:07:20	indeedwatson	i'd love that
2015-12-08 12:07:39	indeedwatson	btw, are you considering what VR could bring to films?
2015-12-08 12:08:28	AlexJ44	the glasses thingy?
2015-12-08 12:08:36	indeedwatson	yes lol
2015-12-08 12:08:43	Porkepikk	Better porn
2015-12-08 12:08:50	Porkepikk	Not even kidding
2015-12-08 12:09:19	AlexJ44	haha
2015-12-08 12:09:25	Porkepikk	Yep
2015-12-08 12:09:31	Porkepikk	Still not kidding
2015-12-08 12:09:37	Porkepikk	Wait a bit
2015-12-08 12:10:24	indeedwatson	nsfw? http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/tenga-oculus-rift-sex-simulator.jpg
2015-12-08 12:10:36	Porkepikk	Nope, definitly not kidding
2015-12-08 12:11:17	indeedwatson	yeah it's nothing new
2015-12-08 12:11:17	Porkepikk	Great watson, wasnt expecting a pic of you :P
2015-12-08 12:11:40	Porkepikk	You sure want those glasses
2015-12-08 12:11:43	indeedwatson	im pretty sure that dude's asian :p
2015-12-08 12:12:08	Porkepikk	Well, the big issue is that they make most people dizzy after a while
2015-12-08 12:12:31	Porkepikk	But some interesting shorts are going to be made for those, i'm sure
2015-12-08 12:13:03	indeedwatson	obviously the main application is videogames (and porn) but I'm curious how a movie would look through one
2015-12-08 12:13:20	indeedwatson	maybe james cameron will get into it
2015-12-08 12:16:11	Porkepikk	The way they work, james cameron would make shit. Pixar needs to get into it
2015-12-08 12:16:24	Porkepikk	The VR needs real 3D to ve at full potential
2015-12-08 12:16:39	AlexJ44	oh, it's nice that you mentioned avatar
2015-12-08 12:16:51	indeedwatson	but he would push the medium! Look at all the good avatar did to the world of film!
2015-12-08 12:16:53	Porkepikk	I mean, would nt say shit i m being mean to James :P
2015-12-08 12:16:57	indeedwatson	Porkepikk: what do you mean real 3d
2015-12-08 12:17:02	indeedwatson	real 3d would be sculptures lol
2015-12-08 12:17:13	AlexJ44	TF and r/movies have had interesting discussions on avatar
2015-12-08 12:17:26	AlexJ44	and it seems like all avatar did was push 3d
2015-12-08 12:17:37	AlexJ44	so it's a really medium dependant film
2015-12-08 12:17:42	AlexJ44	and so is mad max, for example
2015-12-08 12:18:08	Porkepikk	I m going to replace real with "full" 3D
2015-12-08 12:18:17	Porkepikk	Like an animation movie
2015-12-08 12:18:39	indeedwatson	an animation movie where you can move around and experience the environment?
2015-12-08 12:19:02	indeedwatson	AlexJ44: im pretty sure i'd still enjoy mad max a lot on my computer screen
2015-12-08 12:19:06	Porkepikk	No, the camera moves for you eventually but thats where it would be the most immersive
2015-12-08 12:19:22	Porkepikk	Right now its used for video games, with full 3D engine
2015-12-08 12:20:03	AlexJ44	i did so too
2015-12-08 12:20:09	AlexJ44	but it's clearly a film intended for cinema
2015-12-08 12:20:35	indeedwatson	i think that applies to most films
2015-12-08 12:20:38	Porkepikk	So, you need a movie made in 3D not shot with cameras
2015-12-08 12:20:47	AlexJ44	but the point is made clearer with avatar: with no 3D, it's obsolete
2015-12-08 12:20:49	Porkepikk	A pixar movie for example
2015-12-08 12:20:58	AlexJ44	it applies to some films, not all
2015-12-08 12:21:24	indeedwatson	most feature films?
2015-12-08 12:23:01	indeedwatson	im gonna make lunch, bbl

2015-12-08 12:25:11	Porkepikk	Hahahahahaa
2015-12-08 12:25:15	Porkepikk	Wasn t expecting that one
2015-12-08 12:25:20	Porkepikk	The french tv show ?

2015-12-08 12:26:45	AlexJ44	that explains a lot
2015-12-08 12:27:07	AlexJ44	well it's probably a fake graph, i'm not sure the news media is reliable
2015-12-08 12:27:19	AlexJ44	but if it were true, it would explain a lot
2015-12-08 12:34:55	Porkepikk	No, mostly a joke
2015-12-08 12:35:23	Porkepikk	FN voters are older than others
2015-12-08 12:52:03	AlexJ44	is it?
2015-12-08 12:52:16	AlexJ44	(sorry for the late response Porkepikk )
2015-12-08 12:52:51	AlexJ44	the correlation makes some sense: the people who most consume television news and programmes are most likely to follow its trend
2015-12-08 12:53:09	AlexJ44	but that's obviously a more complex problem in france
2015-12-08 12:53:25	Porkepikk	Yeah, well almost everyone consume TV
2015-12-08 12:54:03	Porkepikk	It's bot where the problem comes from. People are desesperated, Right and Left parties are a fucking mess
2015-12-08 12:54:23	Porkepikk	So they think maybe the far right could fix things, after we never tried them

2015-12-08 13:10:37	Porkepik	multiculturalism worked great in france after the war
2015-12-08 13:10:42	Porkepik	it doesn't work nowadays cause of the crisis

2015-12-08 13:11:03	zxc	'so they think maybe the far right could fix things' <-- this reminds of a certain country in the 1930s

2015-12-08 13:12:47	Porkepik	France has way more immigrants and foreigners than other eastern countries, that doesn't help. It becomes easy for people to huge that "huge" minority being a cause to their issues, they want an answer, cause facing a harsh truth is not possible for them

2015-12-08 13:45:52	AlexJ44	here's an example: "But then the grannies turned out to be snipers and more badass road warriors and you realize that the reason they're so old and dry is probably because they spent decades just scissoring in the desert, so I pick up my genitals, wiped off the popcorn and spat in the lady's drink next to me again to keep her guessing. Game on."
2015-12-08 13:45:59	indeedwatson	muskrat: lol
2015-12-08 13:46:08	muskrat	:D
2015-12-08 13:46:50	Porkepik	AlexJ44 => yes

2015-12-08 13:47:31	AlexJ44	dude can be so funny sometimes
2015-12-08 13:47:50	indeedwatson	hulk hasn't written any articles in ages
2015-12-08 13:50:59	AlexJ44	luckily, you have an immense backlog to read
2015-12-08 13:51:12	AlexJ44	she posted a huge list of literature
2015-12-08 13:51:15	AlexJ44	she is very well read
2015-12-08 13:51:44	indeedwatson	you confirmed it's a she?
2015-12-08 13:55:09	AlexJ44	not really, but I'm fairly certain
2015-12-08 13:55:33	AlexJ44	but maybe I'm being a part of the trend hulk wants to eliminate
2015-12-08 13:55:52	AlexJ44	i'm judging his/her gender by his/her cinematic, literary and cultural consumption

2015-12-09 15:55:03	Porkepik	Hello
2015-12-09 15:55:09	Porkepik	Sorry gotta eat
2015-12-09 15:55:20	Porkepik	Never saw you there
2015-12-09 15:55:27	Porkepik	Welcome ?
2015-12-09 15:55:33	false10	my first time
2015-12-09 15:55:36	false10	thanks
2015-12-09 15:55:38	Porkepik	Welcome :)
2015-12-09 15:56:15	false10	do any of you know rob ager?
2015-12-09 15:56:43	false10	he's making film analysis videos on youtube
2015-12-09 15:57:54	Porkepik	oh yeah, never watched
2015-12-09 15:58:46	false10	well, he just posted a video titled "Political Correctness IS the NEW BIGOTRY"
2015-12-09 15:59:31	false10	so i looked around about his political views and found out he's a conspiracy theorist and climate change denier
2015-12-09 16:00:02	false10	my first feeling was to be sort of disappointed and sad
2015-12-09 16:00:37	uguuuuu	lol
2015-12-09 16:01:29	false10	what i'm actually getting at is: does an opposing political view change your view of an artist?
2015-12-09 16:01:55	false10	a view that's not (overly) represented in his work
2015-12-09 16:03:11	indeedwatson	false10: yeah i know him
2015-12-09 16:03:30	indeedwatson	but i think conspiracy theorist is a bs term
2015-12-09 16:04:02	indeedwatson	he actually has a few videos about the nature of conspiracy theories which is alright
2015-12-09 16:04:15	indeedwatson	that said, im not a fan of his latest videos, and it's completely unrelated to his political views
2015-12-09 16:04:39	indeedwatson	mostly cause he pushes his website too much and the videos feel like a tease to get you to buy his stuff
2015-12-09 16:04:54	indeedwatson	but his analysis on kubrick films are pretty interesting
2015-12-09 16:05:31	indeedwatson	false10: can you link me to that video?
2015-12-09 16:05:33	false10	yes, but I don't think he's annoying about it

2015-12-09 16:05:42		[ http://is.gd/XvbUv0 ]
2015-12-09 16:05:59	false10	it's his right to not offer every video for free
2015-12-09 16:07:30	indeedwatson	i know, but it's just how i feel, mainly cause i prefer the patreon model and i feel he tries to troll sometimes and ends up like this https://media3.giphy.com/media/ifxLK48cnyDDi/200_s.gif
2015-12-09 16:07:52	indeedwatson	that said i might agree with this last video
2015-12-09 16:09:30	Porkepik	I would say when i learn an artist doesn't share the same view than me, most of the time it doesn't change my view on his work*
2015-12-09 16:09:40	Porkepik	but i would be more careful if he is giving informations
2015-12-09 16:09:45	Porkepik	youtube channel aren't art
2015-12-09 16:09:48	indeedwatson	yeah
2015-12-09 16:10:12	Porkepik	a movie made by a racist or a rapist (Hello Polanski) i don't give a shit cause it may be one of the best movie ever made
2015-12-09 16:10:17	indeedwatson	it reminds me when i learned that elisabeth moss is a scientologist
2015-12-09 16:10:34	Porkepik	but a youtube channel which is suppose to give you information, i would be careful cause the guy is obviously biased (we all are)
2015-12-09 16:10:53	Porkepik	but he is biased and may be too attached to his political views (if he starts talking politics all the time)
2015-12-09 16:11:08	Porkepik	it really depends on the content
2015-12-09 16:11:29	indeedwatson	he is biased in that he hates mad max fr and thinks mad max 2 is the best thing ever

2015-12-09 16:12:19	Porkepik	now i would never say a movie is better than another
2015-12-09 16:12:22	indeedwatson	woah never heard that
2015-12-09 16:12:31	indeedwatson	tho i have to watch 1 yet
2015-12-09 16:12:37	indeedwatson	but tonight im watching chinatown!
2015-12-09 16:12:42	Porkepik	Haha, that's complicated
2015-12-09 16:13:01	indeedwatson	does the word china get said a lot in chinatown?
2015-12-09 16:13:06	Porkepik	but i really think 1 is fucking good and overrated as fuck cause people wants action and dead people Mad Max 1 is actually very fucked up, looks more like a thriller
2015-12-09 16:13:17	Porkepik	What ?
2015-12-09 16:13:27	Porkepik	No, actually you barelay see Chinatown (don't think that's a spoiler)
2015-12-09 16:13:40	Porkepik	you will see, the title doesn't mean much
2015-12-09 16:14:11	indeedwatson	good
2015-12-09 16:14:13	Porkepik	and underrated* (when i was talking about MM1)
2015-12-09 16:14:22	indeedwatson	yeah, i was gonna ask about that 
2015-12-09 16:14:23	false10	on my second viewing, i actually thought the title meant a lot, but that's spoiler territory
2015-12-09 16:14:40	Porkepik	i don't know, when i watch it i didn't care
2015-12-09 16:15:11	Porkepik	oh you're talking second viewing
2015-12-09 16:15:16	Porkepik	still haven't watch it twice
2015-12-09 16:17:45	false10	it's not something you necessarily only get on second viewing
2015-12-09 16:18:33	indeedwatson	"why not have a goth present the news for once", that made this video worth watching
2015-12-09 16:18:56	false10	i just wondered why the film is called that and realized it's more about jake's connection to chinatown than the movie's
2015-12-09 16:22:21	Porkepik	"climate change denier" i always wonder how people come to that point
2015-12-09 16:22:31	Porkepik	i mean the conspiracy thing ... whatever
2015-12-09 16:22:36	Porkepik	but the climate change ...
2015-12-09 16:23:44	Porkepik	Cashmere Cat is a genius
2015-12-09 16:23:51	Porkepik	He made me like a song with Ariana Grande
2015-12-09 16:23:57	Porkepik	Usually not a big fan of her voice
2015-12-09 16:24:57	Porkepik	false10 => Are you using letterboxd ?
2015-12-09 16:25:17	false10	aren't conspiracy theorists and climate change deniers practically indestinguishable?
2015-12-09 16:25:36	Porkepik	dunno, never got interested in it enough
2015-12-09 16:25:37	false10	no, only imdb
2015-12-09 16:26:07	Porkepik	what's your imdb if i may ?
2015-12-09 16:26:50	false10	http://www.imdb.com/user/ur23260120/?ref_=nv_usr_prof_2
2015-12-09 16:26:51		[ http://is.gd/0mN8Ce ]
2015-12-09 16:27:44	indeedwatson	conspiracy theorist is a dumb term
2015-12-09 16:27:52	false10	be glad, i have tons of them in my family and it's one of the less pleasant topics around gatherings ;)
2015-12-09 16:28:02	false10	why?
2015-12-09 16:28:23	indeedwatson	for this reason, it makes you group people that have nothing to do with each other
2015-12-09 16:28:48	indeedwatson	conspiracies obviously exist in the world, and it has nothing to do with aliens and lizard people
2015-12-09 16:29:07	Porkepik	We never said it was about that
2015-12-09 16:29:25	indeedwatson	but by making it a term and then making it an insult, you can automatically disregard anyone that talks about a conspiracy as a crazy person
2015-12-09 16:29:47	Porkepik	i don't think we used it as an insult
2015-12-09 16:29:56	Porkepik	as i said : "i mean the conspiracy thing ... whatever"
2015-12-09 16:30:08	Porkepik	i'm not a fan of conspiracies, 98% of them are complete bullshit
2015-12-09 16:30:12	Porkepik	but i can understand some
2015-12-09 16:30:22	indeedwatson	i meant this  false10 | aren't conspiracy theorists and climate change deniers practically indestinguishable?
2015-12-09 16:30:22	Porkepik	i was more interested in that climate change denie
2015-12-09 16:30:26	false10	well i did, and i think you're kind of right
2015-12-09 16:30:53	Porkepik	you right quite high, not that i mind but is there a reason ?
2015-12-09 16:31:03	Porkepik	do you rate movies in a particular way or you don't really care ?
2015-12-09 16:31:20	false10	but it's not like i disregard flat out every conspiracy

2015-12-09 16:32:07	indeedwatson	yeah im mostly thinking of reddit threads when the term conspiracy theory is used as an argument in itself

2015-12-09 16:33:05	false10	yes, i try to avoid movies i probably won't like
2015-12-09 16:33:22	Porkepik	Reddit is not a place to talk about anything in a interesting way
2015-12-09 16:33:32	Porkepik	i gave up on that website exept for a few subs
2015-12-09 16:34:01	false10	sometimes my curiosity gets me, but most of the time i don't watch a film, if i don't expect to rate it a 6 or 7 at least
2015-12-09 16:34:25	indeedwatson	i found the thread about schindler's list in r/movies quite interesting Porkepik 
2015-12-09 16:34:35	indeedwatson	who was it that hated that film? RyanSmallwood_ ?
2015-12-09 16:34:44	Porkepik	no me, i don't hate it
2015-12-09 16:34:49	Porkepik	i just think it's overrated, not a masterpiece
2015-12-09 16:34:59	Porkepik	but the movie is on a technical level very good
2015-12-09 16:35:16	Porkepik	Ryan hasn't watch it yet
2015-12-09 16:35:45	Porkepik	false10 => Ok, do you rate on "quality" or your enjoyment of the movie ?
2015-12-09 16:35:59	Porkepik	cause i'm surprise to see Martyrs with such a low rating
2015-12-09 16:36:04	indeedwatson	who was it then who wanted to make an essay about it
2015-12-09 16:36:09	Porkepik	Me
2015-12-09 16:36:10	false10	strictly enjoyment
2015-12-09 16:36:14	Porkepik	oh ok i see
2015-12-09 16:36:16	indeedwatson	oh
2015-12-09 16:36:33	Porkepik	there is a thread about the movie ?
2015-12-09 16:36:34	false10	but with martyrs, i still would argue that the quality is very low
2015-12-09 16:36:49	false10	i seriously cannot understand the praise it gets
2015-12-09 16:37:58	false10	to find real quality discussion on reddit, you have to go deep and search a little, in my experience
2015-12-09 16:38:12	indeedwatson	Porkepik: https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3vze4q/til_when_spielberg_first_showed_john_williams_a/cxs46gm i thought it was interesting to hear about the account of an actual holocaust surviver
2015-12-09 16:38:32	indeedwatson	false10: martyrs, from what i recall, is one of my favorite horror movies
2015-12-09 16:38:48	Porkepik	oh yeah that's a repost of a repost of a repost :D
2015-12-09 16:39:02	Porkepik	r/Todayilearned is basically that now
2015-12-09 16:39:05	false10	can you explain why?
2015-12-09 16:39:12	false10	i don't ahve a problem with the gore or anything
2015-12-09 16:39:30	false10	i just don't think it has anything interesting to say
2015-12-09 16:39:34	indeedwatson	the ending is something that always interested me
2015-12-09 16:39:37	false10	and it's not even good on a technical level
2015-12-09 16:39:41	Porkepik	indeedwatson => Exept, it's one survivor, and just cause one actor looked very close from the actual person doesn't mean in the movie he is described the same way
2015-12-09 16:40:06	indeedwatson	what if there is a mental state that we can reach, but it requires extreme, morally wrong actions
2015-12-09 16:40:09	Porkepik	My main issue with Schindler's List is that Spielberg wanted to talk about the holocaust, and ends up putting his political views in it
2015-12-09 16:40:36	Porkepik	mixed with a very classic character development, the holocaust wasn't "normal" it needed something more unusual, weird to it
2015-12-09 16:40:44	Porkepik	something that would make you feel like nothing is right
2015-12-09 16:41:29	indeedwatson	i really wish you watched band of brothers to know what you think of it
2015-12-09 16:41:40	Porkepik	Oh yeah, but it's pretty long :/
2015-12-09 16:41:44	Porkepik	Don't have time for it
2015-12-09 16:41:46	indeedwatson	10 episodes
2015-12-09 16:41:52	indeedwatson	that's like the opposite of a long tv show
2015-12-09 16:41:56	Porkepik	Yeah, but one hour each no ? I have to watch movies daily
2015-12-09 16:42:06	Porkepik	exept i struggle to get into shows
2015-12-09 16:42:09	indeedwatson	meh :p
2015-12-09 16:42:12	Porkepik	:(
2015-12-09 16:42:24	indeedwatson	just watch good stuff, who cares what medium it is or what label it has
2015-12-09 16:42:54	indeedwatson	false10: but yeah, that's what i recall i liked about it, on top of creeping me out
2015-12-09 16:42:57	Porkepik	I do, they're still not the same thing
2015-12-09 16:43:16	Porkepik	A show is waaaay more long than a film on average, also it usually is less interesting to me
2015-12-09 16:43:22	uguuuuu	‾‾ ͜ʖ‾‾)ノ
2015-12-09 16:43:26	Porkepik	i watched a few, but now i'm bored of them
2015-12-09 16:43:30	indeedwatson	satantango disagrees
2015-12-09 16:43:31	Porkepik	Hey uguuuuuuuuuu
2015-12-09 16:43:39	Porkepik	satantango lasts 7 hours
2015-12-09 16:43:49	Porkepik	BoB is like 10 hours
2015-12-09 16:44:01	indeedwatson	spread out in 10 bits tho
2015-12-09 16:44:30	Porkepik	Satantango is also an experience, most shows are just entertaining but then you forget about them 1 week later
2015-12-09 16:44:54	indeedwatson	you're comparing 1 movie with all of tv shows
2015-12-09 16:45:09	indeedwatson	most movies are just entertaining and you forget about them 1 week later, too
2015-12-09 16:46:05	Porkepik	yeah, whatever, i'm not arguing it's better, just that satantango is not a good example. A film is very different to a show, to me
2015-12-09 16:46:13	Porkepik	Shows are not my thing, i know it, i watched quite a lot already
2015-12-09 16:46:14	indeedwatson	it's kinda like judging a book by its length
2015-12-09 16:46:32	indeedwatson	a film is very different to another film too
2015-12-09 16:46:40	indeedwatson	my point is that you have to judge things individually
2015-12-09 16:47:09	Porkepik	Yeah, i'm trying, but right now i don't want to watch shows, i did research, most of them aren't worth MY(personal opinion) time
2015-12-09 16:47:11	uguuuuu	i think making generalizations is ok too :D
2015-12-09 16:47:25	uguuuuu	because your average tv show really is made different from an average film
2015-12-09 16:47:41	indeedwatson	but who cares about average
2015-12-09 16:47:54	indeedwatson	average of anything is shit
2015-12-09 16:47:56	uguuuuu	i mean, not average in quality, just typical in terms of production
2015-12-09 16:48:29	Porkepik	The best of the best shows are still not that interesting to me, even the average-good movie is more entertaining to me
2015-12-09 16:48:54	Porkepik	ME MY MYSELF IT IS MY OPINION AND I M NOT STATING IT IS TRUE FOR EVERYONE => Prefer to watch movies, i know i enjoy them more
2015-12-09 16:49:07	Porkepik	so sorry, BoB not on my watchlist :/
2015-12-09 16:49:15	uguuuuu	it's worth watching though V
2015-12-09 16:49:17	uguuuuu	:V
2015-12-09 16:49:21	Porkepik	To you maybe
2015-12-09 16:49:24	indeedwatson	well, it's your loss :p
2015-12-09 16:49:24	Porkepik	to me, i'm someone else
2015-12-09 16:49:28	uguuuuu	lol
2015-12-09 16:49:33	uguuuuu	you don't need to be so defensive
2015-12-09 16:49:40	false10	have you seen "The Wire"?
2015-12-09 16:49:40	Porkepik	I'm not defensive
2015-12-09 16:49:41	Porkepik	:)
2015-12-09 16:49:45	uguuuuu	otherwise we'd use that to reply to anything anyone else ever wrote about film?
2015-12-09 16:49:49	uguuuuu	"for you, maybe"
2015-12-09 16:49:52	Porkepik	A little yeah, got interested in it
2015-12-09 16:49:57	Porkepik	yeah, it is valid
2015-12-09 16:49:59	Porkepik	it's art
2015-12-09 16:50:00	Porkepik	it's biased
2015-12-09 16:50:13	indeedwatson	but it's not interesting :p
2015-12-09 16:50:34	indeedwatson	and doesn't allow much discussion
2015-12-09 16:50:40	uguuuuu	it's not valid, if you're just going to dismiss others' opinions like that
2015-12-09 16:50:41	Porkepik	well, we can share PoV
2015-12-09 16:50:47	uguuuuu	what's the point in talking to other humans at all?
2015-12-09 16:50:51	Porkepik	Sharing
2015-12-09 16:51:05	uguuuuu	:D
2015-12-09 16:51:21	Porkepik	But we all have different visions, the goal is to see if someone may change our opinion with good enough arguments
2015-12-09 16:51:30	Porkepik	doesn't mean it always works
2015-12-09 16:51:31	uguuuuu	if you haven't seen it though, you can't have an opinion on whether or not it was worth watching
2015-12-09 16:51:44	uguuuuu	you can only say you're not interested in it
2015-12-09 16:51:49	Porkepik	yep, i did say that
2015-12-09 16:51:59	Porkepik	i'm not interested in watching shows, i did say it
2015-12-09 16:52:24	indeedwatson	to me it's just puzzling that you're not interested not because it's bad, not because of the subject matter, but because of length
2015-12-09 16:52:38	Porkepik	exactly
2015-12-09 16:52:43	Porkepik	that's a valid argument to me
2015-12-09 16:52:50	Porkepik	if i don't have the time for it, i won't do it
2015-12-09 16:52:56	Porkepik	cause my life is not about watching shows and movies
2015-12-09 16:54:02	indeedwatson	but it's like saying "i dont read books over 200 pages long", and then you go read five 200pages books, which altogether might be worse than one 1000page book
2015-12-09 16:54:17	Porkepik	i never said i didn't watch shows
2015-12-09 16:54:24	Porkepik	i never said i don't watch long stuff
2015-12-09 16:54:30	Porkepik	just that i prefer not too
2015-12-09 16:54:39	Porkepik	if someone doesn't want to read books over 200 pages long
2015-12-09 16:54:41	Porkepik	i don't mind it
2015-12-09 16:54:44	Porkepik	at least he is reading
2015-12-09 16:54:52	Porkepik	compare to many people on earth
2015-12-09 16:55:37	false10	i understand you Porkepik
2015-12-09 16:55:43	indeedwatson	i can't do that, cause i know that person has interest in reading and might be missing some of the best books ever written because of an arbitrary rule
2015-12-09 16:55:58	uguuuuu	it's ok, band of brothers isn't THAT good ^_______^
2015-12-09 16:56:05	uguuuuu	not as good as The Wire!
2015-12-09 16:56:07	indeedwatson	but this is not #trueseries anyway
2015-12-09 16:56:09	indeedwatson	uguuuuu: fite me
2015-12-09 16:56:21	Porkepik	Well, maybe you care too much about others ? (not saying it's true, but so far it looks like that)
2015-12-09 16:56:28	indeedwatson	nothing is as good as the wire
2015-12-09 16:56:43	indeedwatson	Porkepik: it's not that i care, like i said it just puzzles me
2015-12-09 16:56:56	indeedwatson	i could say i like some works of art too much
2015-12-09 16:57:13	Porkepik	I could say i like things you don't, you like things i don't
2015-12-09 16:57:38	uguuuuu	are there really people who refuse to read books over 200 pages long
2015-12-09 16:57:40	indeedwatson	it's not that, it's the reasoning
2015-12-09 16:57:45	Porkepik	That's why Pornhub categories aren't just "Teen/SmallBoobs/Cumshot"
2015-12-09 16:57:51	indeedwatson	lol
2015-12-09 16:58:04	uguuuuu	there's actually a sort of reverse trend of that book length thing
2015-12-09 16:58:13	uguuuuu	where people look specifically for books that are trilogies
2015-12-09 16:58:21	uguuuuu	or part of some huge epic cycle
2015-12-09 16:58:34	Porkepik	Lotr/Harry Potter/GoT helped a lot
2015-12-09 16:58:41	Porkepik	people are looking for the new Hunger Games, the new GoT
2015-12-09 16:58:46	Porkepik	the new things to hype and be hipster about
2015-12-09 16:58:48	uguuuuu	like a single self contained story isn't enough, it has to be a world you can invest yourself in
2015-12-09 16:58:55	uguuuuu	and return to to extract the same pleasures
2015-12-09 16:59:13	Porkepik	oh yeah uguuuuu, your reasoning makes more sense than mine :P
2015-12-09 16:59:22	uguuuuu	i guess that's part of the appeal of longer tv shows as well
2015-12-09 16:59:27	uguuuuu	over self contained films
2015-12-09 16:59:35	Porkepik	yeah i guess, people watch less movies
2015-12-09 16:59:38	Porkepik	and more shows now
2015-12-09 16:59:44	indeedwatson	i dont think there's any good long shows
2015-12-09 16:59:53	indeedwatson	or any good shows that maintained its quality
2015-12-09 17:00:00	indeedwatson	through 9 seasons or more
2015-12-09 17:00:14	uguuuuu	sure
2015-12-09 17:00:51	false10	the simpsons first 9 seasons?
2015-12-09 17:01:19	Porkepik	mmh ...
2015-12-09 17:01:22	Porkepik	not always taht good
2015-12-09 17:01:49	indeedwatson	i mean a show that is long and has maintained quality all the way
2015-12-09 17:02:32	uguuuuu	i originally said long to mean longer than movies are :V
2015-12-09 17:02:45	Porkepik	What's that emote :V
2015-12-09 17:02:50	Porkepik	It's like a bird or a duck

2015-12-10 22:52:46	indeedwatson	alison brie will be in the disaster artist
2015-12-10 22:52:54	indeedwatson	i might need to watch that now
2015-12-10 22:53:00	Porkepik	The movie about The Room ?
2015-12-10 22:53:17	indeedwatson	yea
2015-12-10 22:54:00	Porkepik	Alison Brie isn't my kind of girl so i don't really understand all the talk around her beauty :P
2015-12-10 22:54:07	Porkepik	She is pretty, but i want a cute girl
2015-12-10 22:54:30	indeedwatson	are you saying she isn't cute?
2015-12-10 22:54:59	Porkepik	When you get old, you're not pretty anymore. So a pretty girl just becomes old and ugly. But you can stay cute, so i want a pretty cute girl so when she is old she is still cute :D
2015-12-10 22:55:03	Porkepik	To me yeah
2015-12-10 22:55:11	indeedwatson	http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-A6ZkJ15yAVI/T_SmDxDb5xI/AAAAAAAAAxM/JlsVpUijdKE/s1600/IMG_5905.JPG
2015-12-10 22:55:20	Porkepik	That's not cute to me
2015-12-10 22:55:40	Porkepik	but i get it, she sure is very attractive
2015-12-10 22:55:47	indeedwatson	weird
2015-12-10 22:55:50	indeedwatson	what do you find cute
2015-12-10 22:56:25	Porkepik	well idk, honestly i prefer unknown and normal girl, somehow i find something beautiful in being "ignored"
2015-12-10 22:56:33	Porkepik	The blonde with long legs well ... she is too much for me
2015-12-10 22:56:36	Porkepik	i like simplicity
2015-12-10 22:57:04	indeedwatson	that's called girl nextdoor
2015-12-10 22:57:12	Porkepik	?
2015-12-10 22:57:38	Porkepik	oh no not like that
2015-12-10 22:57:42	Porkepik	not the innocent looking girl
2015-12-10 22:57:58	Porkepik	i don't know how to describe so whatever, i have weird taste
2015-12-10 22:58:44	indeedwatson	well you didn't give any examples
2015-12-10 22:58:47	Porkepik	oh wait, still not sure about the definition of girl nextdoor
2015-12-10 22:58:55	Porkepik	ok, now i get what that is
2015-12-10 22:59:01	Porkepik	i can't think of an actress sorry
2015-12-10 22:59:04	Porkepik	or a model
2015-12-10 22:59:07	RyanSmallwood	I prefer Ivy Ling Po dressed as a young male scholar http://www.hkmdb.com/db/images/people/3134/IvyLingPo-65-b.jpg
2015-12-10 22:59:07		[ http://is.gd/AZP2VA ]
2015-12-10 22:59:08	Porkepik	don't really have an example
2015-12-10 22:59:10	indeedwatson	from what you said, alison brie could fit perfectly, specially when compared to the blonde next to her in Community
2015-12-10 22:59:27	indeedwatson	yeah... that's... ok...
2015-12-10 22:59:44	Porkepik	Ryan and his wuxia fetish

2015-12-10 23:01:31	RyanSmallwood	Porkepik: what did you think of Cleo???
2015-12-10 23:01:43	RyanSmallwood	(as a film, topic shift)

2015-12-10 23:02:31	Porkepik	Fuck, i may spend the next day thinking about it
2015-12-10 23:02:33	Porkepik	all fucking day
2015-12-10 23:02:42	RyanSmallwood	:D
2015-12-10 23:03:21	Porkepik	That's the definition of arthouse, on a technical level but also the way she is represented and "displayed" (fuck there is a better word for that) in the environment around her
2015-12-10 23:03:28	Porkepik	i mean, don't have the right words
2015-12-10 23:05:40	Porkepik	At first, she seemed lost and alone in her head
2015-12-10 23:06:28	Porkepik	like when she meet her friend, the "model"
2015-12-10 23:07:26	Porkepik	and her lover, the people around her. At no point you feel love
2015-12-10 23:07:32	Porkepik	fuck i really struggle to find those damn words
2015-12-10 23:08:47	Porkepik	Anyway nobody is trying to understand her and just put her in a "box"
2015-12-10 23:11:16	RyanSmallwood	yup yup
2015-12-10 23:11:26	RyanSmallwood	I think I know what you're getting at
2015-12-10 23:11:44	Porkepik	but i was wondering about that superstition thing
2015-12-10 23:12:26	RyanSmallwood	its been a while since I watched, does it come back in after the first scene?
2015-12-10 23:12:32	Porkepik	if it was cause of the bad influence her "manager", or whoever she was, could have on her
2015-12-10 23:12:36	Porkepik	well it does a little bit
2015-12-10 23:12:48	Porkepik	but she pretty much leave and wear the hat
2015-12-10 23:12:53	Porkepik	like fuck it, let me live
2015-12-10 23:13:34	Porkepik	then she tries to find comfort or whatever with her friend but it's pretty much a failure
2015-12-10 23:14:10	Porkepik	Then the man, who is pretty much the complete opposite of her but still tries to cheer her up
2015-12-10 23:15:16	Porkepik	even though, weirdly, they are both facing "death"
2015-12-10 23:16:01	Porkepik	I mean, to me, that's why he is able to help her
2015-12-10 23:16:49	Porkepik	but anyway, whatever the deeper meaning of all of that is, it's mainly a critism of the algerian war :P
2015-12-10 23:17:07	RyanSmallwood	heh
2015-12-10 23:18:50	Porkepik	also feminism obviously
2015-12-10 23:19:01	RyanSmallwood	yup yup
2015-12-10 23:19:13	Porkepik	Will watch it a second time soon
2015-12-10 23:19:36	Porkepik	I recognize godard at some point
2015-12-10 23:19:37	RyanSmallwood	it doesn't fit on the 60s list, but if you do any Varda follow up, I highly recommend Vagabond
2015-12-10 23:20:16	Porkepik	ok, yeah i really want to see her movies now
2015-12-10 23:20:36	RyanSmallwood	I haven't dug into all her work, she does a lot of documentary stuff I haven't watched yet
2015-12-10 23:21:39	Porkepik	I love how those movies can be experimental with the visuals and the camera
2015-12-10 23:21:47	Porkepik	It's so impressive sometimes
2015-12-10 23:22:20	Porkepik	At some point, she changes her dress and go hide behind a black curtain, then to make a transition, the screen turn to black but it's actually the curtain
2015-12-10 23:22:50	RyanSmallwood	heh
2015-12-10 23:23:19	RyanSmallwood	I really like the scene where she's singing in front of the black cloth/curtain or whatever it was and it dollies in on her face until she's just surrounded by a void
2015-12-10 23:23:40	Porkepik	yeah, we forget about the other people in the room
2015-12-10 23:23:47	Porkepik	then it unzooms suddenly at the end
2015-12-10 23:25:41	Porkepik	Well, gonna stop there
2015-12-10 23:25:42	Porkepik	good night
2015-12-10 23:25:54	Porkepik	Tomorrow will watch Vivre sa vie i guess
2015-12-10 23:26:34	RyanSmallwood	goodnight

2015-12-11 18:54:46	muffinm4ster	Hello?
2015-12-11 18:57:00	Porkepik	HEllo
2015-12-11 18:57:11	Porkepik	wassup
2015-12-11 18:57:24	muffinm4ster	I have some question about a film?
2015-12-11 18:57:42	Porkepik	I don't know, i gues you do
2015-12-11 18:57:55	muffinm4ster	is this the right place to ask?
2015-12-11 18:58:15	Porkepik	Yeah, but first do you know the answer to your first question ?
2015-12-11 18:58:19	Porkepik	do you have a question ?
2015-12-11 18:59:28	muffinm4ster	yes sorry but it didnt want to waste my time if it wasnt the right place to ask. The 1924 movie Greed had originally 10 hours of footage, but most of it was lost. Now only 2 hours exists? Correct?
2015-12-11 19:00:18	Porkepik	no idea :(
2015-12-11 19:00:43	uguuuu	hmm
2015-12-11 19:00:50	uguuuu	looks like there's a four hour "reconstructed" cut
2015-12-11 19:00:53	muffinm4ster	Because on kick ass torrents the film is only a hour and ten minutes, on youtube there is a 2 hour version, and a 4 hour paid version. When I google the film it has 4 hours on IMDB
2015-12-11 19:02:19	Porkepik	What a mess muffin, i wish you good luck on your journey :(
2015-12-11 19:02:27	Porkepik	May the right cut be with you

2015-12-11 19:04:11	RyanSmallwood	the 4 hour version is a reconstruction with stills
2015-12-11 19:04:41	RyanSmallwood	so 2 hours of actual footage + 2 hours of still photography and explanations of the missing footage
2015-12-11 19:05:31	Porkepik	I knew Ryan would have the answer
2015-12-11 19:05:34	Porkepik	He is our oracle
2015-12-11 19:06:35	RyanSmallwood	you're all in trouble if I'm your oracle
2015-12-11 19:06:51	muffinm4ster	ok thank you
2015-12-11 19:07:08	RyanSmallwood	its all Huang Mei Diao opera and wuxia from here on out
2015-12-11 19:07:16	RyanSmallwood	by the by, on Greed
2015-12-11 19:07:24	RyanSmallwood	I watched the 2 hour version first and thought it was very good
2015-12-11 19:07:41	uguuuu	tell me what wuxia film i should watch next!
2015-12-11 19:07:47	RyanSmallwood	I watched the 4 hour reconstruction and was interested in it, but couldn't really get immersed in the narrative with all the reconstructed sections
2015-12-11 19:08:07	RyanSmallwood	uguuuu: what wuxia have you seen?
2015-12-11 19:09:10	uguuuu	eight diagram pole fighter, one armed swordsman, come drink with me

2015-12-11 21:37:00	Porkepik	R34 pizza ?
2015-12-11 21:37:04	RyanSmallwood	been way to long since I've seen it, back in the day I was too cool for the new "slower" wuxia, but I recently re-watched Zhang Yimou's Hero and really liked it, so I should probably re-watch  House of Flying Daggers
2015-12-11 21:37:30	inddwtsn	i recall it being so stunning visually
2015-12-11 21:37:45	inddwtsn	even back then when i didn't have that much appreciation for film "painting"
2015-12-11 21:38:18	RyanSmallwood	yeah its got some pretty extraordinary scenes
2015-12-11 21:39:41	Porkepik	Tomorrow Paris belongs to us, but the only torrent i found has a shitty quality :/
2015-12-11 21:39:48	RyanSmallwood	:(

2015-12-11 21:42:11	Porkepik	couldn't find it on itunes :/
2015-12-11 21:42:26	Porkepik	Honestly if it's as good as the rest, i would have spend a few euros to rent it
2015-12-11 21:48:48	Porkepik	27% done at least \o/
2015-12-11 21:49:17	RyanSmallwood	:)
2015-12-11 21:49:20	Porkepik	so 10/37 cause % don't mean much :P
2015-12-11 21:49:42	RyanSmallwood	I'll be curious to see your reactions to some of the Eastern European stuff
2015-12-11 21:50:10	Porkepik	Yep, gonna change from the italian/french stuffs
2015-12-11 21:50:43	Porkepik	Do they smoke as much as italians and french ? :D
2015-12-11 21:51:33	RyanSmallwood	heh, I don't think so
2015-12-11 21:55:42	Porkepik	i loved the talk between Nana and the philosopher
2015-12-11 21:56:23	RyanSmallwood	yeah, Brice Parain

2015-12-11 22:00:44	Porkepik	you put 5 godard movies, i think that's the most represented director with antonioni on the list
2015-12-11 22:01:26	inddwtsn	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwYXu0YaHto so good
2015-12-11 22:01:28	RyanSmallwood	actually left out some pretty major Godard films still, his style changes a lot over the 60s,  doesn't really make sense to watch only 1 or 2 of his films
2015-12-11 22:03:12	Porkepik	he made quite a lot of movies, will very probably watch the rest
2015-12-11 22:03:31	Porkepik	i went to see my grandfather today
2015-12-11 22:03:37	Porkepik	he showed me his super 8 camera

2015-12-11 22:04:07	RyanSmallwood	cool!
2015-12-11 22:04:07	Porkepik	also i have the dvd of Play Time and Contempt
2015-12-11 22:04:22	RyanSmallwood	Contempt is another major one I left off to not let the list get too long
2015-12-11 22:04:30	RyanSmallwood	but you should probably see it as some point
2015-12-11 22:04:43	Porkepik	ok, will do will do

2015-12-11 22:06:15	Porkepik	i feel bad for the guy, he made a few song for inception and now everybody think he is the epic trailer guy :(
2015-12-11 22:06:35	Porkepik	i'm sure he hates that "BOOOOONG" in inception more than everybody in the world :D
2015-12-11 22:06:53	inddwtsn	dunno, the way he makes music, i don't think he's much of an auteur so to speak
2015-12-11 22:07:27	Porkepik	What ?
2015-12-11 22:07:35	Porkepik	Never said he was an auteur that has nothing to do
2015-12-11 22:08:30	inddwtsn	i didn't say you said it
2015-12-11 22:08:34	inddwtsn	im just saying it
2015-12-11 22:08:47	Porkepik	Yeah but auteur means nothing when you're talking about a compositer
2015-12-11 22:09:00	Porkepik	compositor or music artist or whatever

2015-12-11 22:10:24	inddwtsn	why not
2015-12-11 22:10:30	uguuuu	it's a film theory term
2015-12-11 22:10:34	inddwtsn	a music artist can make a film
2015-12-11 22:10:44	RyanSmallwood	I don't really like the term auteur
2015-12-11 22:10:45	uguuuu	but he doesn't make films, he writes movies for films
2015-12-11 22:10:50	uguuuu	writes music for films
2015-12-11 22:11:08	inddwtsn	yeah i guess it applies to all OST composers
2015-12-11 22:11:13	Porkepik	yep, he just makes music, sometimes without even knowning what the movie talks about
2015-12-11 22:11:22	inddwtsn	but his style feels particularly manufactured to me sometimes
2015-12-11 22:11:27	Porkepik	Also, can people stop using french word when talking about cinema ? :P
2015-12-11 22:11:34	inddwtsn	nein
2015-12-11 22:12:09	RyanSmallwood	nope, using French words shows your smart
2015-12-11 22:12:09	Porkepik	cause everybody tries to sound like him
2015-12-11 22:12:20	inddwtsn	him who?
2015-12-11 22:12:28	Porkepik	Skrillex was pretty ground breaking, now he seems unoriginal cause everybody is trying to make brostep
2015-12-11 22:12:58	Porkepik	Hans Zimmer
2015-12-11 22:13:06	inddwtsn	i feel meh about technological breaks in music being called ground breaking
2015-12-11 22:13:14	Porkepik	WHAT
2015-12-11 22:13:21	Porkepik	that has nothing to do with technological breaks
2015-12-11 22:13:43	Porkepik	skrillex isn't creating computers or AI
2015-12-11 22:13:50	RyanSmallwood	I'm no expert, but I thought stuff skrillex did was already around in underground  electronic music circle, he just popularized it
2015-12-11 22:14:02	RyanSmallwood	*circles
2015-12-11 22:14:06	Porkepik	yeah sure, mostly dubstep tho
2015-12-11 22:14:15	inddwtsn	im pretty sure, in purely musical terms, it's nothing new
2015-12-11 22:14:16	Porkepik	skream is one of the first to make brostep i think
2015-12-11 22:14:42	Porkepik	it doesn't have to be "new"
2015-12-11 22:14:44	inddwtsn	standard harmonies and rhythms, the only difference i hear is in timbre and instruments
2015-12-11 22:14:47	Porkepik	in purely musical terms
2015-12-11 22:14:52	Porkepik	it can be "pioneering"
2015-12-11 22:15:20	Porkepik	so i should have use Skream instead of skrillex but he still have his own style, and not saying that cause i like him i don't even listen to dubstep
2015-12-11 22:15:32	inddwtsn	but it is pioneering in terms of sounds it utilizes, not in what it does with the notes and how they interact with each other and the work as a whole
2015-12-11 22:15:35	Porkepik	music isn't just music theory
2015-12-11 22:15:38	uguuuu	lol
2015-12-11 22:15:47	Porkepik	or in that case only jazz really did something this last century
2015-12-11 22:15:48	uguuuu	it's only pioneering in terms of sounds? music is nothing but fucking sounds
2015-12-11 22:15:59	Porkepik	cinema is nothing but fucking pictures
2015-12-11 22:16:06	uguuuu	books are nothing but fucking words!
2015-12-11 22:16:07	Porkepik	painting is nothing  but fucking paint
2015-12-11 22:16:20	inddwtsn	it is more than sounds
2015-12-11 22:16:32	inddwtsn	it's the relation between them
2015-12-11 22:16:59	uguuuu	things like "timbre" are also considered an essential part of what makes up music
2015-12-11 22:17:23	inddwtsn	and Porkepik, that statement about jazz is pretty ignorant of contemporary classical music
2015-12-11 22:17:29	inddwtsn	unless you were only talking about popular music
2015-12-11 22:17:41	inddwtsn	uguuuu: that's relative
2015-12-11 22:18:33	inddwtsn	it's like saying colors are an essential part of what makes up film
2015-12-11 22:18:36	inddwtsn	it is in some films
2015-12-11 22:18:44	inddwtsn	but it is not essential to film as a whole
2015-12-11 22:20:01	uguuuu	can you have music without timbre?
2015-12-11 22:21:08	inddwtsn	i'd say if i read a music sheet and "picture" it in my mind, i can
2015-12-11 22:21:23	inddwtsn	but sometimes timbre is irrelevant or incidental
2015-12-11 22:21:31	uguuuu	i think you've gone a bit far into what constitutes music if you're going into imaginary music
2015-12-11 22:21:38	RyanSmallwood	just shifting definitions to dismiss a piece of art or not
2015-12-11 22:21:52	RyanSmallwood	you can value composition over timbre, but timbre is important to some people
2015-12-11 22:22:05	uguuuu	right, it's just a value judgement
2015-12-11 22:22:21	uguuuu	it's like saying cutting isn't an essential part of film because you can make movies without cuts in one take
2015-12-11 22:22:52	Porkepik	same thing for colors then :P
2015-12-11 22:22:58	inddwtsn	i think the color analogy fits best
2015-12-11 22:23:03	uguuuu	saying that you need to do something new, say, melodically to be considered groundbreaking
2015-12-11 22:23:07	uguuuu	is a sort of value judgement
2015-12-11 22:23:16	uguuuu	it says more about what you personally value in music
2015-12-11 22:23:19	inddwtsn	because it is about something present in it, not about the order and flow of it
2015-12-11 22:24:26	inddwtsn	well yeah, some people value FX more than they value camera work, that doesn't make FX an essential aspect of film making
2015-12-11 22:24:38	inddwtsn	by those same terms we can call Avatar ground breaking
2015-12-11 22:24:42	uguuuu	but timbre is an essential part of something sounds
2015-12-11 22:24:56	uguuuu	i mean i don't think you can have music without timbre
2015-12-11 22:24:57	inddwtsn	but not of music as a whole
2015-12-11 22:25:28	inddwtsn	like i said it is sometimes incidental
2015-12-11 22:26:12	uguuuu	so can any other thing be
2015-12-11 22:26:39	RyanSmallwood	timbre can have a big part of how music feels to people, its perfectly fine to see composition aspects as more innovative, but I don't think you can ground that as something essential to music that people should value over other things
2015-12-11 22:27:20	inddwtsn	i think we can all agree that we often disagree with what most people value in film
2015-12-11 22:27:26	inddwtsn	well, i feel the same way about music
2015-12-11 22:28:27	inddwtsn	to me instrumentation on its own is one of the more shallow aspects of music, specially if it's not carried out with a whole approach that encompases musical ideas as well
2015-12-11 22:31:11	uguuuu	back to the groundbreaking thing though... most people would consider movies that pioneered in special effects groundbreaking too
2015-12-11 22:31:23	inddwtsn	uguuuu: that's why i mentioned avatar
2015-12-11 22:31:24	uguuuu	and they're not even necessary to movie making
2015-12-11 22:31:26	Porkepik	at that point groundbreaking is pretty subjective i guess ?
2015-12-11 22:31:43	uguuuu	or the first movie in colour
2015-12-11 22:31:53	Porkepik	Cause, in electronic music, even tho it's mostly shitty songs, brostep was "groundbreaking" to me. But i don't have an exact idea of its definition :/
2015-12-11 22:32:06	inddwtsn	avatar was groundbreaking in some aspects, does that make it a good film?
2015-12-11 22:32:28	uguuuu	i don't think anyone here asserted that it was a good film :v
2015-12-11 22:32:29	Porkepik	We weren't talking about groundbreaking = good film tho no ?
2015-12-11 22:33:04	inddwtsn	yeah, that was my point, i feel they should be groundbreaking with a * 
2015-12-11 22:33:06	inddwtsn	:p
2015-12-11 22:33:08	inddwtsn	if that makes sense
2015-12-11 22:33:16	Porkepik	with a ?
2015-12-11 22:33:51	inddwtsn	the * symbol which is often used to add a note at the bottom of a page to clear something up about a word
2015-12-11 22:34:11	inddwtsn	like AVATAR IS A GROUNDBREAKING FILM (in some particular technological aspects)
2015-12-11 22:34:25	uguuuu	well i'd say it doesn't necessarily carry a connotation of good for most people
2015-12-11 22:34:30	Porkepik	ok, it's becoming too complicated for me, i'm staying out of it and watching birds outside even though it's pitch dark.
2015-12-11 22:34:37	inddwtsn	lol
2015-12-11 22:34:40	Porkepik	Also, no offense but i don't really give a shit :D
2015-12-11 22:34:59	inddwtsn	do you comment on r/truefilm Porkepik ?
2015-12-11 22:35:02	Porkepik	no
2015-12-11 22:35:14	Porkepik	i shouldn't even comment here :P
2015-12-11 22:35:14	uguuuu	if i said "toy story was a groundbreaking achievement" people wouldn't think "oh cause of its many formal qualities"
2015-12-11 22:35:39	uguuuu	they'd think "oh cause they made it entirely with a bunch of computers"
2015-12-11 22:35:56	inddwtsn	to me groundbreaking means that it pushed the form and boundaries of an art form
2015-12-11 22:36:01	inddwtsn	i guess i use the term differently
2015-12-11 22:36:21	uguuuu	but things like CGI arguably do push the boundaries of an art form
2015-12-11 22:36:42	uguuuu	see: all the films being made that wouldn't be possible without CGI
2015-12-11 22:37:02	inddwtsn	well that depends on what you call "form"
2015-12-11 22:37:15	inddwtsn	but it gets too abstract
2015-12-11 22:37:21	RyanSmallwood	investigating terms like "groundbreaking" is uninteresting, because people use them in different scenarios for different reasons
2015-12-11 22:37:30	RyanSmallwood	what is interesting is figuring out what you mean in a specific discussion
2015-12-11 22:37:40	RyanSmallwood	you can't find a pure essence to terms that applies to all discussions ever
2015-12-11 22:37:46	inddwtsn	that's what im trying to do :p
2015-12-11 22:38:00	RyanSmallwood	we've just gotten off from discussing inception dude or whoever
2015-12-11 22:38:03	RyanSmallwood	to music in general
2015-12-11 22:38:10	uguuuu	and back to movies!

2015-12-11 22:38:36	inddwtsn	if that exists
2015-12-11 22:38:37	uguuuu	anyway the reason we don't apply the term "auteur" to people like composers
2015-12-11 22:38:42	uguuuu	is because they're auteurs by default
2015-12-11 22:38:50	inddwtsn	and if it's not a "omg the beatles" circlejekr
2015-12-11 22:38:51	uguuuu	like a composer is already obviously the author of his work!
2015-12-11 22:38:58	Porkepik	#truemusic where they spend more time talking about music than actually listening to it ? :P
2015-12-11 22:39:20	inddwtsn	idek if the channel exists
2015-12-11 22:39:24	Porkepik	Honestly, auteur is not my vocabulary i refuse to use it :/
2015-12-11 22:39:29	Porkepik	I can't even understand what the fuck it means
2015-12-11 22:39:31	RyanSmallwood	I think auteur is a bogus way of classifying directors anyways
2015-12-11 22:39:32	uguuuu	but you're french :D
2015-12-11 22:39:40	inddwtsn	but i don't think the sub can be comparable to truefilm
2015-12-11 22:40:07	Porkepik	Well, in french it just means writer
2015-12-11 22:40:13	Porkepik	we never call musician auteur
2015-12-11 22:40:18	inddwtsn	by auteur i meant that his music doesn't feel personal to him, to me, it feels manufactured, movie music, even tho i like some of it
2015-12-11 22:40:22	Porkepik	we just call auteur people who wrote books or plays
2015-12-11 22:40:27	RyanSmallwood	exactly
2015-12-11 22:40:49	inddwtsn	in spanish we call autor to whoever authored a piece of art 
2015-12-11 22:40:56	RyanSmallwood	french new wave critics wanted to say films could have a "writer" or "auteur" despite being a mass art
2015-12-11 22:41:18	uguuuu	right, a film is by nature a commercial production involving tons of people
2015-12-11 22:41:23	RyanSmallwood	instead of just a "Metteur en scène" who did the work, "auteurs"  were supposed to make personal films
2015-12-11 22:41:39	uguuuu	and auteur theory gives primacy to the director
2015-12-11 22:42:43	Porkepik	well in that way it makes sense, but then it's just a technical name ? Like director, editor etc ?
2015-12-11 22:44:11	Porkepik	gonna read Truffaut, would be more easy to understand
2015-12-11 22:44:54	AlexJ44	HELLOOOO
2015-12-11 22:45:02	Porkepik	Hello there
2015-12-11 22:45:02	AlexJ44	how you guys doing?
2015-12-11 22:45:05	RyanSmallwood	its not really a useful term today, its just the debates on time
2015-12-11 22:45:06	inddwtsn	is there anybody in there
2015-12-11 22:45:15	RyanSmallwood	Sartre dissed Citizen Kane and said movies couldn't be art
2015-12-11 22:45:22	AlexJ44	how's my homies
2015-12-11 22:45:30	RyanSmallwood	and Bazin and the Cahiers people got all fussy and said some directors were artists
2015-12-11 22:45:50	AlexJ44	RyanSmallwood , IIRC they said 'some' directors were auters
2015-12-11 22:45:55	RyanSmallwood	yeah
2015-12-11 22:46:10	AlexJ44	the most known case being hitchcock, as truffaut struggled to prove he was an auteur despite being in hollywood
2015-12-11 22:46:13	RyanSmallwood	I forget the exact names but they said shit like "The worst film by ____ is better than the best film by _____ "
2015-12-11 22:46:37	AlexJ44	basically, as I see it, auteurs are directors who control the whole artistic side of their films
2015-12-11 22:46:50	RyanSmallwood	the good part is they made it okay to talk about popular directors
2015-12-11 22:46:59	RyanSmallwood	but they also justified some crappy films to fit their theory
2015-12-11 22:47:13	Porkepik	asserting that the worst of Jean Renoir's movies would always be more interesting than the best of the movies of Jean Delannoy
2015-12-11 22:47:29	RyanSmallwood	the examples they used weren't exactly like that
2015-12-11 22:47:51	Porkepik	the way Cahiers said it it's more "A director who applys his own touch to the movie"
2015-12-11 22:47:53	Porkepik	"reflect a director's personal vision"
2015-12-11 22:47:59	RyanSmallwood	yeah
2015-12-11 22:48:24	AlexJ44	yeah, kinda
2015-12-11 22:48:36	Porkepik	"Recognizing the difficulty of reaching this ideal, they valued the work of directors who came close."
2015-12-11 22:48:44	AlexJ44	so, say, you have a director whose films are written by somebody else, I don't think the auteur criteria would apply
2015-12-11 22:48:47	Porkepik	for "encouraging the director to use the commercial apparatus as a writer uses a pen"
2015-12-11 22:49:24	RyanSmallwood	they argued for some directors who weren't writers
2015-12-11 22:49:27	Porkepik	ok i get it i think, wouldn't use the word tho. I'm gonna hurt myself with it :D
2015-12-11 22:49:45	Porkepik	"They championed filmmakers such as Stanley Kubrick, Akira Kurosawa, Nicholas Ray, Erich von Stroheim, Alfred Hitchcock, Howard Hawks, and Jean Renoir as absolute "auteurs" of their films."
2015-12-11 22:49:55	RyanSmallwood	yeah its more tied to film theory and politics of the time than an useful term to understand film history today
2015-12-11 22:50:06	RyanSmallwood	its interesting in that it tell us how the French New Wave though about film
2015-12-11 22:50:33	RyanSmallwood	no contemporary film theorist/historian employs auteur theory anymore as their project
2015-12-11 22:52:37	Porkepik	as confusing as "film noir" now is
2015-12-11 22:52:54	RyanSmallwood	my understanding of film noir is
2015-12-11 22:53:08	RyanSmallwood	a few obscure french critics used the term once (and in different ways)
2015-12-11 22:53:24	RyanSmallwood	American universities picked it up in the 70s/80s and published 30 books on it
2015-12-11 22:53:34	uguuuu	and now it's a genre (but not)
2015-12-11 22:53:36	RyanSmallwood	and it became a real thing cause so much had been written about it

2015-12-11 23:29:24	RyanSmallwood	?????
2015-12-11 23:30:29	RyanSmallwood	wouldn't the differences be something other than the surround sound on headphones?
2015-12-11 23:30:47	inddwtsn	what do you mean
2015-12-11 23:31:10	RyanSmallwood	shouldn't surround and stereo be the same with headphones?
2015-12-11 23:31:12	uguuuu	your headphones only have to drivers, so it's stereo by the time it gets there
2015-12-11 23:31:23	inddwtsn	yes that's my point

2015-12-15 21:16:42	indeedwatson	good, having dinner

2015-12-15 21:17:22	AlexJ44	glad you're back
2015-12-15 21:17:36	Mothravka	Really? What are they saying? I'm interested!
2015-12-15 21:17:54	indeedwatson	oh since you're here, you once told me your favorite film but i can't remember
2015-12-15 21:17:58	indeedwatson	i know it was haneke
2015-12-15 21:18:12	Mothravka	The Seventh Continent (1989).
2015-12-15 21:18:47	AlexJ44	well I'm not sure, but there was something I wanted to ask someone and they told me you'd probably know about it
2015-12-15 21:18:48	indeedwatson	is it still your favorite fiml or have you seen something better since
2015-12-15 21:19:04	Mothravka	Oh.
2015-12-15 21:19:12	AlexJ44	and you watch pornographic amounts of film
2015-12-15 21:20:00	AlexJ44	which is great
2015-12-15 21:20:00	Mothravka	I haven't rewatched it this year, but i rewatched some other stuff, but Eros Plus Massacre (1969) and The Face of Another (1966) are my top favourites for the moment.
2015-12-15 21:20:13	indeedwatson	someone on my letterboxd already watched sw
2015-12-15 21:20:13	Mothravka	Yeah, I guess I love to watch films.
2015-12-15 21:20:47	AlexJ44	how do you manage so many films a day?
2015-12-15 21:20:52	indeedwatson	Mothravka: did you give up on your 350 list?
2015-12-15 21:20:56	AlexJ44	it's some stamina
2015-12-15 21:21:06	Mothravka	indeedwatson: It was 250!
2015-12-15 21:21:38	indeedwatson	it'll be 150 next month
2015-12-15 21:21:43	indeedwatson	like pokemons but backwards
2015-12-15 21:21:46	Mothravka	I think I'll change it a bit, not totally ready yet, but I think I'll be posting it to Letterboxd later.
2015-12-15 21:22:19	Mothravka	Gave up on writing comments on the Imgur-album mostly. So it will probably just be a list without comments or anything.
2015-12-15 21:23:17	indeedwatson	why not write the comments as reviews on letterboxd
2015-12-15 21:23:29	Mothravka	They will be far too short.
2015-12-15 21:23:57	Mothravka	Plus, I feel that I'm not that good in English to put them up, hah!
2015-12-15 21:24:10	AlexJ44	what list are you talking about?
2015-12-15 21:24:20	indeedwatson	can't be worse than some of the reviews we've seen
2015-12-15 21:24:49	indeedwatson	there was one about chinatown "i'd let polanski fiddle me"
2015-12-15 21:24:59	Mothravka	AlexJ44: I started making a top 250 list.
2015-12-15 21:25:07	AlexJ44	of films you've watched?
2015-12-15 21:25:12	Mothravka	Yup.
2015-12-15 21:25:58	AlexJ44	where are you from?
2015-12-15 21:26:08	AlexJ44	not meaning to stalk you, but you've said you don't speak english very well
2015-12-15 21:26:21	Mothravka	I live in Sweden.
2015-12-15 21:26:30	indeedwatson	i think most of us are not from the us, which is interesting
2015-12-15 21:28:32	indeedwatson	ok i added eros to my watchlist
2015-12-15 21:29:07	AlexJ44	yeah
2015-12-15 21:29:17	AlexJ44	we have really diverse tastes as well
2015-12-15 21:29:21	AlexJ44	or so, I'd like to believe so
2015-12-15 21:29:29	Mothravka	Eros Plus Massacre (1969)?
2015-12-15 21:29:43	AlexJ44	yeah, I've added those to my list as well
2015-12-15 21:29:54	AlexJ44	I think you should probably try and do a small write-up on each
2015-12-15 21:29:58	Mothravka	Me and you? Or did you mean indeedwatson?
2015-12-15 21:30:05	Mothravka	I'll see about that, hah.
2015-12-15 21:30:12	AlexJ44	it's so much more interesting that way. even if you have trouble with it, we can surely help you
2015-12-15 21:30:16	AlexJ44	we all do
2015-12-15 21:30:31	indeedwatson	yeah, i guess i'll add the face of another as well
2015-12-15 21:30:37	AlexJ44	well, maybe not me as much, because I'm still watching 'generic' stuff
2015-12-15 21:30:41	indeedwatson	Mothravka: i don't recall seeing you make mistakes
2015-12-15 21:30:47	AlexJ44	but I suppose you and RyanSmallwood have different tastes
2015-12-15 21:31:02	AlexJ44	we should invite tony zhou over sometime lol
2015-12-15 21:31:26	indeedwatson	that'd be neat but i think we should have more people before that
2015-12-15 21:32:09	Mothravka	I don't know too much about the taste of every person in here, but I think it's just interesting and healthy that people have different tastes here. Then one can learn from each other etc.
2015-12-15 21:32:49	Mothravka	indeedwatson: The Face of Another (1966) is amazing! Oh. What a movie.
2015-12-15 21:33:14	indeedwatson	I'll see if i can find a torrent
2015-12-15 21:33:47	AlexJ44	of course! you should come along mroe
2015-12-15 21:33:56	Mothravka	I'll try, heh.
2015-12-15 21:33:59	AlexJ44	more* I haven't seen any films lately, mostly because of my tight uni schedule
2015-12-15 21:34:19	AlexJ44	but I think even by forcing myself to write about some of them, you're learning more and more
2015-12-15 21:34:22	indeedwatson	i saw vertigo yesterday
2015-12-15 21:34:29	AlexJ44	first time?
2015-12-15 21:34:31	indeedwatson	ye
2015-12-15 21:34:37	Mothravka	Classic.
2015-12-15 21:37:01	indeedwatson	like i said earlier i didn't much like the ending
2015-12-15 21:37:08	indeedwatson	but i loved the dream sequence
2015-12-15 21:49:25	AlexJ44	i honestly don't really get all the fuss about it
2015-12-15 21:49:43	AlexJ44	i think the reasons for having citizen kane as "the best film ever" are more tangible
2015-12-15 21:49:59	AlexJ44	but the scene where they finally kiss after her transformation gave me the goosebumps last time

2015-12-15 21:59:57	AlexJ44	what did you think of it Mothravka ?
2015-12-15 22:01:48	Mothravka	I've seen it several times, but it was a couple of years ago since I saw it the last time. But I think it's one of Hitchcock's best movies.
2015-12-15 22:02:13	Mothravka	I have to rewatch it soon, looking forward to doing that as well.
2015-12-15 22:04:37	indeedwatson	i like the movie as a whole, just the last few minutes felt, like i told Card74, convenient just to have a dramatic ending
2015-12-15 22:06:47	indeedwatson	i need to watch more hitchcock
2015-12-15 22:07:08	Mothravka	Me too.
2015-12-15 22:08:21	indeedwatson	ive seen north by northwest, psycho and rear window
2015-12-15 22:08:54	Mothravka	I've seen 25 of his movies, so still a lot left.
2015-12-15 22:09:03	indeedwatson	shit
2015-12-15 22:09:04	indeedwatson	haha
2015-12-15 22:09:17	Mothravka	Oh, then you have even movies left to see than me.
2015-12-15 22:09:28	zxc	rear window, vertigo, north by northwest, lifeboat, rebecca, dial m for murder, suspicion, shadow of a doubt, rope, strangers on a train
2015-12-15 22:09:30	Mothravka	+more
2015-12-15 22:09:30	zxc	for me
2015-12-15 22:09:40	zxc	but there's a lot!
2015-12-15 22:09:55	indeedwatson	i might watch the wrong man next, just to catch a filmspotting episode
2015-12-15 22:10:00	zxc	my favourites so far would be rear window, north by northwest and rope I think
2015-12-15 22:10:33	indeedwatson	rear window might still be my favorite
2015-12-15 22:10:46	Mothravka	Same here.
2015-12-15 22:10:50	zxc	and here :)
2015-12-15 22:12:07	Mothravka	Rear Window (1954) and Vertigo (1958) are the top ones for me so far.
2015-12-15 22:13:08	AlexJ44	i like rear window as well
2015-12-15 22:13:12	AlexJ44	grace kelly +++
2015-12-15 22:13:22	AlexJ44	oh, indeedwatson, that podcast is nice
2015-12-15 22:13:28	AlexJ44	I've listened to two episodes so far I think
2015-12-15 22:13:44	AlexJ44	the one on inside out, where they talked about top 5 actor/director collabs
2015-12-15 22:14:37	indeedwatson	yeah i like the hosts, wish i could only listen to the 2nd part of the episodes where they talk about big new movies
2015-12-15 22:46:08	indeedwatson	Mothravka: are you excited for sw??!!?!
2015-12-15 22:46:56	Mothravka	No.
2015-12-15 22:47:45	Mothravka	But I'll watch it when I can.

2015-12-17 18:46:07	@Carson	just watched a doc about New Yorker cartoonists on HBO
2015-12-17 18:46:14	@Carson	called Very Semi Serious
2015-12-17 18:46:47	Card74	just add a script that kicks on !list
2015-12-17 18:47:46	@indeedwatson	Carson: what else have you watched
2015-12-17 18:48:05	@Carson	not much besides tv
2015-12-17 18:48:13	@Carson	finished Fargo season 2
2015-12-17 18:48:24	@Carson	been slowly watching Star Trek TNG just for fun
2015-12-17 18:48:58	@Carson	really tired of all the SW marketing
2015-12-17 18:49:26	@indeedwatson	yeah, i probably will go watch it in like a month
2015-12-17 18:49:27	@indeedwatson	maybe
2015-12-17 18:49:58	@Carson	I would like to see it sooner than later but I know the theaters will be chaotic
2015-12-17 18:50:37	@indeedwatson	krampus had a surprising number of people 
2015-12-17 18:51:46	@Carson	would also like to see Carol, Revenant, or Spotlight in theaters
2015-12-17 18:51:57	@Carson	but probably won't
2015-12-17 18:52:20	@indeedwatson	i heard good things about carol but i don't think it'll be released here
2015-12-17 18:52:28	@indeedwatson	revenant, will probably go see, and hateful 8
2015-12-17 18:55:22	@indeedwatson	oh, carol will be released on february
2015-12-17 18:55:26	@indeedwatson	so i'll go see that too
2015-12-17 18:56:04	@indeedwatson	i should have a calendar for this
2015-12-17 19:01:40	@indeedwatson	wtf there's only one torrent in KAT
2015-12-17 19:01:45	@indeedwatson	luckily it's good enough
2015-12-17 19:01:58	@Carson	for Carol?

2015-12-17 19:02:19	@indeedwatson	i'll wait for Carol
2015-12-17 19:04:03	@indeedwatson	i need to rewatch wonder showzen
2015-12-17 19:05:25	@Carson	doesn't seem like the channel is as active as it was last month
2015-12-17 19:05:28	@Carson	but I've been away
2015-12-17 19:08:48	Porkepik	Well, it's not cause you were away, people aren't used to IRC, they come one or twice and then forget about it
2015-12-17 19:10:07	Porkepik	I started following some people that came here on letterboxd, they even seem to watch movies quite often, but they completly forgot about this place and must not really see an use for it.
2015-12-17 19:10:59	Porkepik	IRC is most often used by programmers or in music making cause it's when you may struggle to do something and you need "immediate" advice.
2015-12-17 19:11:26	Porkepik	Film "people" (whatever the correct word is) and IRC don't get along :/
2015-12-17 19:11:59	Porkepik	I could even be mean and say filmbuffs are really shit with computers
2015-12-17 19:12:31	Porkepik	Except people working in editing, the rest focus on books most of the time.
2015-12-17 19:13:37	Porkepik	And IRC isn't easy to use, people often see that as an ugly skype ... I mean, most people still think the comparaison makes sense ... Won't complain, as i said, most of these people know more than me on some other subjects where i could say stupid things

2015-12-17 19:27:47	Porkepik	yeah, and is it that big ?
2015-12-17 19:28:02	Porkepik	Cause hiphopheads has a huge IRC channel
2015-12-17 19:28:03	@indeedwatson	not "big", but active almost 24/7

2015-12-17 19:31:41	@indeedwatson	nah no spoilers
2015-12-17 19:31:56	Porkepik	Don't think i will go see it in the upcoming weeks
2015-12-17 19:31:56	@indeedwatson	i did make a comment about my feeling about reviews i've read earlier
2015-12-17 19:32:12	Porkepik	will wait towards the end of the projection
2015-12-17 19:32:13	RyanSmallwood	ahh, I'm avoiding reviews too, even the spoiler free ones
2015-12-17 19:32:48	@indeedwatson	i wouldn't watch it without reading reviews to be frank
2015-12-17 19:32:52	@indeedwatson	Porkepik: might do the same
2015-12-17 19:33:00	@indeedwatson	i don't even care much about getting spoiled
2015-12-17 19:33:33	RyanSmallwood	I'm super hyped so I want to go in as blind as possible without anyone else's expectations
2015-12-17 19:33:43	RyanSmallwood	if you're not sold on it, obviously reviews will help you decide
2015-12-17 19:33:47	RyanSmallwood	I already know I'm seeing it
2015-12-17 19:33:56	Porkepik	yeah me too, the only reason i would want to see it is to see some Lightsabers fights and the "i hope" beautiful cinematography
2015-12-17 19:34:12	@indeedwatson	RyanSmallwood: you've seen trailers tho?
2015-12-17 19:34:22	Porkepik	so the story, i just except something classic with a cliffhanger i guess cause apparently it's a trilogy
2015-12-17 19:34:45	@indeedwatson	ONLY a trilogy?
2015-12-17 19:34:46	RyanSmallwood	I saw the main 3 trailers, when there was that "international trailer with extra footage" I decided I'd seen enough already
2015-12-17 19:35:14	@indeedwatson	ah, cause i was gonna comment how dumb the light saber with 2 tiny lasers on the sides looks and maybe that was spoilers for you
2015-12-17 19:35:25	RyanSmallwood	a "trilogy" for the main storyline and then all the standalone star wars films
2015-12-17 19:35:49	RyanSmallwood	so next year "Rogue One" isn't part of the main trilogy, but its another Star Wars film
2015-12-17 19:36:07	@indeedwatson	star wars forever
2015-12-17 19:36:16	RyanSmallwood	Rogue One has a really great cast though
2015-12-17 19:36:21	Porkepik	The big issue is when they feel they have to find innovative design, i'm sure that could be a pet peeve for me
2015-12-17 19:36:42	Porkepik	so i will see, maybe the trailer exagerated that part
2015-12-17 19:36:53	@indeedwatson	Porkepik: did you see the george lucas video i posted last night
2015-12-17 19:37:04	Porkepik	don't think so

2015-12-17 21:05:00	RyanSmallwood	also that probably a lot of nerdy film culture isn't very inviting to women

2015-12-17 21:06:04	RyanSmallwood	some areas are, but a lot of "gateway" films to film nerddom  isn't necessarily
2015-12-17 21:06:27	Porkepik	Like Jodorowsky and Lynch ?
2015-12-17 21:06:48	RyanSmallwood	I dunno if I would call them gateway
2015-12-17 21:06:55	Porkepik	I have no idea what it means

2015-12-17 21:11:49	Porkepik	I don't see why it being released in 2016 would change the format :/

2015-12-17 21:14:30	RyanSmallwood	no 70mm screenings near me, and not getting a wide release til new years
2015-12-17 21:14:58	RyanSmallwood	Star Wars pushed Hateful 8 and The Revenant back to 2016
2015-12-17 21:15:11	Porkepik	At the same time, that's been decades people stop using 70mm ... How can he except every cinema to adapt just to please him ? :/
2015-12-17 21:15:19	Porkepik	In France we switched a long time ago
2015-12-17 21:15:43	Porkepik	so, i checked, there are 6 screenings in 70mm so won't see it in 70mm, won't make much difference
2015-12-17 21:15:57	RyanSmallwood	I think they're helping theaters setup for 70mm
2015-12-17 21:16:07	Porkepik	Still, not that easy to plan
2015-12-17 21:16:11	RyanSmallwood	there's probably at least 1 screening in France

2015-12-17 21:19:18	Porkepik	Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Kill Bill 1 and 2, Inglorious Basterds, Django
2015-12-17 21:19:30	RyanSmallwood	ah, so you're nice and familiar then :)
2015-12-17 21:19:34	Porkepik	yeah
2015-12-17 21:19:40	Porkepik	Django was nice but i hated the end :/
2015-12-17 21:19:47	Porkepik	without the end i agree it's a cool movie
2015-12-17 21:21:37	RyanSmallwood	I love Kill Bill
2015-12-17 21:21:56	Porkepik	The first one yeah, i need to rewatch
2015-12-17 21:21:59	Porkepik	the second one tho ...
2015-12-17 21:22:11	Porkepik	Also same thing, i hate the end
2015-12-17 21:22:12	RyanSmallwood	whaaaat, all the 2nd kill bill deniers are crazy
2015-12-17 21:22:15	Porkepik	but even more than Django
2015-12-17 21:22:22	RyanSmallwood	you're dead to me
2015-12-17 21:22:32	Porkepik	:| I knew it would end like that
2015-12-17 21:22:40	Porkepik	Tarantino was gonna destroy that IRC
2015-12-17 21:24:26	@indeedwatson	i don't much like inglorious basterds
2015-12-17 21:24:31	tomflint	I even like Tarantino's episode of Alias.
2015-12-17 21:24:37	@indeedwatson	hah
2015-12-17 21:24:41	@indeedwatson	i remember the CSI one
2015-12-17 21:24:42	RyanSmallwood	I'm tempted to ask you to elaborate, but your language is so feisty I don't think the discussion would end well
2015-12-17 21:24:51	@indeedwatson	oh boy i shouldn't have said i watched CSI
2015-12-17 21:24:57	RyanSmallwood	(in response to Porkepik on Kill Bill)
2015-12-17 21:25:04	Porkepik	Yeah :/
2015-12-17 21:25:12	Porkepik	As i said, would need to rewatch
2015-12-17 21:25:13	@indeedwatson	kill bill used to be my favorite movie
2015-12-17 21:25:14	RyanSmallwood	Yeah, I really can't get into Inglorious Basterds
2015-12-17 21:25:17	Porkepik	Honestly, can't remember much
2015-12-17 21:25:41	@indeedwatson	and i feel the same way as Porkepik, in regards to basterds, i've only seen it once, so i should rewatch
2015-12-17 21:25:43	tomflint	I've been into him from the get-go, but I found that I really started to appreciate him when I got into Westerns
2015-12-17 21:26:09	@indeedwatson	what i can remember: waltz is great as usual, the french lady was very pretty, i thought brad pitt overdid it
2015-12-17 21:26:18	RyanSmallwood	I thought I was going to enjoy Basterds more when I re-watched it, it has nice moments, but overall the tone is off
2015-12-17 21:26:22	tomflint	oh man! its supposed to be like that
2015-12-17 21:26:47	@indeedwatson	and django has the problem that i like waltz more than i like the movie as a whole
2015-12-17 21:26:52	tomflint	His method isn't to convince you that this is a real story happening to real people, etc --- he wants you to get into the movie and out of reality
2015-12-17 21:27:27	Porkepik	Yeah, doesn't work on me, But it did for Jackie Brown
2015-12-17 21:27:32	Porkepik	I think it's Tarantino best movie
2015-12-17 21:27:40	RyanSmallwood	Jackie Brown is good
2015-12-17 21:28:49	@indeedwatson	yeah its my fav too
2015-12-17 21:28:58	RyanSmallwood	tomflint: there's millions of ways a film can be a more stylized narrative that doesn't resemble reality, but ultimately it depends on how it works for you
2015-12-17 21:29:22	@indeedwatson	tomflint: which is your favorite
2015-12-17 21:30:04	tomflint	I think Basterds is my overall favorite -- but I like individual scenes from Reservoir Dogs more
2015-12-17 21:31:03	@indeedwatson	that's another i gotta rewatch
2015-12-17 21:32:10	tomflint	for me, they all have aspects that they master --
2015-12-17 21:34:04	@indeedwatson	what does IG master
2015-12-17 21:34:15	@indeedwatson	IB*
2015-12-17 21:35:26	tomflint	for me, its almost like a heist movie from two angles
2015-12-17 21:37:01	tomflint	I also love how it addresses the fact that people don't always believe in a cause, they just want to be on the winning team
2015-12-17 21:37:42	@indeedwatson	a lot of people praise mostly the opening scene
2015-12-17 21:37:56	tomflint	its fantastic
2015-12-17 21:38:07	tomflint	it's so well balanced with the bar scene
2015-12-17 21:38:48	RyanSmallwood	like a lot of scenes in IB, but the scenes of the Basterds killing Nazis always feel off in tone to me
2015-12-17 21:38:57	RyanSmallwood	*I like
2015-12-17 21:39:35	@indeedwatson	i remember reading posts about that
2015-12-17 21:40:02	@indeedwatson	about whether it's hypocrite cause it condones violence but uses it for entertainment, etc
2015-12-17 21:41:06	RyanSmallwood	Yeah, I dunno if I would want to get into a discussion about it on moral grounds, but  it just didn't sit well with me for whatever reason
2015-12-17 21:43:23	RyanSmallwood	it seems somewhat self aware having the Nazi's laughing at the sniper film, but the film doesn't go anywhere past winking at the audience
2015-12-17 21:51:10	«	muskrat (~musk@trivialand/player/muskrat) has quit (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
2015-12-17 21:57:19	tomflint	its not far off from American Sniper though, really ---
2015-12-17 22:08:26	@indeedwatson	which one was that?
2015-12-17 22:08:30	@indeedwatson	clint eastwood?
2015-12-17 22:19:19	@Carson	yeah with Bradley Cooper
2015-12-17 22:19:31	@Carson	I cringe at the film
2015-12-17 22:19:41	@indeedwatson	i remember hearing bad things about it
2015-12-17 22:19:43	@Carson	and it was widely popular and successful
2015-12-17 22:20:12	@Carson	I'm typically okay with Eastwood films
2015-12-17 22:20:39	@Carson	it was just war porn
2015-12-17 22:20:58	tomflint	total war porn
2015-12-17 22:21:36	tomflint	and if it had been shot by the Nazi's, it'd be exactly like the prop film in IB
2015-12-17 22:23:31	@Carson	looks like Americas new narrative is pointing towards the islamic state in Syria
2015-12-17 22:23:55	@Carson	and Trump will cash in on it
2015-12-17 22:25:36	@Carson	tomflint finished season 2 of Fargo, I enjoyed it, still a bit lukewarm for some reason though, some of the reveals or assumptions weren't really necessary
2015-12-17 22:25:53	tomflint	such a bizarre ending
2015-12-17 22:27:46	@Carson	some of the antagonist stuff assumption stuff was weird
2015-12-17 22:28:35	@indeedwatson	should i watch eros plus massacre right now
2015-12-17 22:28:59	@Carson	there was some season 1 reveal thing you might not know about
2015-12-17 22:29:15	@Carson	that relates to the conversation at the baseball field
2015-12-17 22:29:44	@Carson	I haven't seen Eros+Mass
2015-12-17 22:29:58	tomflint	I mean, if you've got 3.5 hours to kill -- yes
2015-12-17 22:30:24	@Carson	I'm on season 5 of my TNG top 40 episode watch
2015-12-17 22:30:35	tomflint	yes!
2015-12-17 22:30:57	@Carson	I'm loving it
2015-12-17 22:31:27	tomflint	it'd be nice if someone went through series and marked down essential episodes that capture the overall story
2015-12-17 22:31:28	@Carson	I feel like X-files was too depressing to binge watch
2015-12-17 22:31:36	tomflint	the X-Files community has done that
2015-12-17 22:31:43	tomflint	oh man, Millennium is worse
2015-12-17 22:31:57	tomflint	it was a spin-off during season 4 or so --- its ultra dark
2015-12-17 22:32:18	@Carson	TNG is a bit more optimistic, and I like the diplomacy and future aspects of it
2015-12-17 22:32:48	@Carson	oh TNG does have a essential list Tomflint
2015-12-17 22:33:03	tomflint	well, naturally the Trekkers would cover that
2015-12-17 22:33:14	tomflint	but for every episodic series
2015-12-17 22:33:37	@Carson	ah
2015-12-17 22:33:45	@Carson	I used this one https://medium.com/maxistentialism-blog/star-trek-the-next-generation-in-40-hours-c4a6762cbd3
2015-12-17 22:33:46		[ http://is.gd/JxU0wN ]
2015-12-17 22:34:01	@Carson	but there is a more in depth version
2015-12-17 22:34:23	@Carson	https://www.reddit.com/r/DaystromInstitute/wiki/algernonguide_tng
2015-12-17 22:34:23		[ http://is.gd/WGj1Qe ]
2015-12-17 22:34:44	@Carson	and there is list for every trek series
2015-12-17 22:35:14	tomflint	what kills me is the lack of depth with Star Trek --
2015-12-17 22:35:23	tomflint	like, they never get into the Borg naming conventions...
2015-12-17 22:35:33	tomflint	same with Star Wars too --
2015-12-17 22:36:35	@Carson	what do you mean?
2015-12-17 22:38:26	tomflint	well, I assumed that both universes were fleshed out and had some sort of baseline material to keep things consistent --
2015-12-17 22:38:44	tomflint	but with Star Wars, it's pretty much 'if its in the movie, that's right... but nothing really has to make sense'
2015-12-17 22:39:57	tomflint	In Episode III Palpatine tells Anakin that there was this Sith Lord who was fucking with the Force -- trying to manipulate it too far. The Midichlorians retaliated, and instead of allowing the darkness, they created a life --
2015-12-17 22:40:49	@Carson	hmm like better world building?
2015-12-17 22:40:58	tomflint	now, with what we know, Anakin's mother said that she had a virgin birth and all - and it would seem that this is why Palpatine is telling him this. But they leave it at that -- no confirmation, nothing. But it would seem that Anakin was the one who was to bring balance to the Force
2015-12-17 22:41:27	tomflint	yeah, go the Tolkien route and establish the world and then write within that world instead of the other way around
2015-12-17 22:41:42	@Carson	SW and ST probably just made all of their decisions on a whim
2015-12-17 22:42:13	tomflint	yeah, especially Star Wars --
2015-12-17 22:42:28	tomflint	it seems that it was Lucas writing a script, then his wife and that other guy hacking it up to make it good
2015-12-17 22:43:11	@Carson	hmm
2015-12-17 22:43:11	@Carson	I know i've said it before
2015-12-17 22:43:21	@Carson	but someone else needs to watch the Leftovers
2015-12-17 22:43:34	@Carson	The Leftovers season 2 was excellent
2015-12-17 22:43:51	tomflint	I've been hearing a lot of people say that they turned it around
2015-12-17 22:44:13	@Carson	yeah, like season 1 was an okay show, good first season
2015-12-17 22:44:22	@Carson	then season 2 rolls around
2015-12-17 22:45:41	@Carson	episode after episode
2015-12-17 22:45:41	@Carson	is great
2015-12-17 22:45:41	@Carson	if anything, watch a season 1 recap
2015-12-17 22:45:42	@Carson	and then watch the first 2 episodes of season 2
2015-12-17 22:46:09	@Carson	and they got the show renewed last week, but are stopping it at season 3 probably because of low ratings
2015-12-17 22:46:53	«	AlexJ44 (~textual@unaffiliated/alexj44) has quit (Quit: My Mac has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
2015-12-17 22:47:07	@Carson	but it's great they are doing 3 seasons because it won't be dragged out, and have a solid planned out end

2015-12-17 22:49:10	Porkepik	Well, i'm going to bed. Good night all
2015-12-17 22:49:39	@Carson	yes they are stopping after season 3 I believe
2015-12-17 22:49:40	tomflint	night, Porkepik
2015-12-17 22:49:43	Porkepik	And Hail to our new overlord and operator indeedwatson \o/
2015-12-17 22:49:43	@Carson	gn Porkepik
2015-12-17 22:49:48	tomflint	Carson: I wish more shows would do that
2015-12-17 22:50:09	@Carson	I'm happy with it, as long as season 3 is as good at 2
2015-12-17 22:50:13	tomflint	skip that Walking Dead approach where they see how long they can draw out a series with no budget --
2015-12-17 22:50:31	«	Porkepik (~Porkepik@ARouen-652-1-367-31.w90-17.abo.wanadoo.fr) has quit
2015-12-17 22:51:17	@indeedwatson	tomflint: that sounds like standard tv show behavior
2015-12-17 22:51:28	tomflint	its awful
2015-12-17 22:51:37	tomflint	Walking Dead is the worst. Prison Break was another
2015-12-17 22:51:46	@Carson	Walking Dead aired the same time as The Leftovers
2015-12-17 22:52:16	@Carson	probably took some viewers from TL, but TL is a difficult/ boring show to most people
2015-12-17 22:52:51	@Carson	hate WD too
2015-12-17 22:53:00	@Carson	it's just a cash cow for AMC
2015-12-17 22:54:57	@Carson	tom what would yours or everyones recommended top 5 tv shows of 2015
2015-12-17 22:55:13	@Carson	I have yet to see Transparent but everyone is praising it at #1
2015-12-17 22:55:21	@indeedwatson	i haven't seen enough to recommend even 1 
2015-12-17 22:56:19	@Carson	Show Me a Hero, The Leftovers, Fargo, Better Call Saul, can't think of a 5th choice though, maybe just rick and morty
2015-12-17 22:56:38	@Carson	those are my top 5 personal favorite solid shows
2015-12-17 22:57:02	@Carson	and Mad Men said goodbye, but it wasn't the best season
2015-12-17 22:57:44	@indeedwatson	oh BCS, i forgot
2015-12-17 22:58:00	@indeedwatson	and i thought when you say 2015 shows, you meant shows that started in 2015
2015-12-17 22:58:13	@indeedwatson	then i guess i'd include mad men and r&m
2015-12-17 23:26:16	@Carson	so I'm going to see SW on Monday night
2015-12-17 23:31:28	@Carson	I'm a bit polarized by it though
2015-12-17 23:32:12	@Carson	my adult self doesn't like it, but my childhood self is hyped
2015-12-17 23:32:40	@Carson	just want to see what happens, feel like I'm more excited for Rian Johnson directing Ep 8
2015-12-17 23:35:21	@indeedwatson	I'm 80% certain I know how I'll feel
2015-12-17 23:39:01	@Carson	it's going to be a original trilogy JJ Abrams circle jerk
2015-12-17 23:39:03	@Carson	but that's ok
2015-12-17 23:40:06	@Carson	all the other franchises look a bit more mediocre
2015-12-17 23:41:10	@Carson	I'm still optimistic about Rouge One and Episode 8 too
2015-12-17 23:42:58	@indeedwatson	i'm not sure what i'm hyped for this next year
2015-12-17 23:43:07	@indeedwatson	i remember when i was hyped for interstellar lol
2015-12-17 23:43:18	@Carson	oh but that's Nolan
2015-12-17 23:43:49	@indeedwatson	yeah i probably won't be hyped for him ever again
2015-12-17 23:44:14	@Carson	hmm
2015-12-17 23:44:29	@Carson	just had an odd thought
2015-12-17 23:44:37	@Carson	guess it relates with globalization
2015-12-17 23:44:49	@Carson	but I don't get excited for many American films anymore
2015-12-17 23:45:36	@Carson	Oscar season stuff and maybe a few summer blockbusters, a few indie films maybe
2015-12-17 23:45:41	@indeedwatson	with me it's that my favorite film makers don't seem to have much planned for next year
2015-12-17 23:45:48	@indeedwatson	blade runner is all I can think of
2015-12-17 23:45:54	@indeedwatson	does PTA have anything?
2015-12-17 23:45:57	@Carson	no
2015-12-17 23:46:11	@Carson	he's been on a feature streak lately though
2015-12-17 23:46:20	@Carson	lets hope for no more breaks
2015-12-17 23:46:25	@indeedwatson	johnatan glazer doesn't either
2015-12-17 23:46:29	@Carson	Malick has a new film in March
2015-12-17 23:46:32	@indeedwatson	oh, the coen bros one
2015-12-17 23:46:37	@indeedwatson	i need to get into malick
2015-12-17 23:46:43	RyanSmallwood	Carson, I'll be meh'd if Star Wars 7 turns out to be only as good as the Star Treks, I'm hoping it will be much better because it feels like they took a lot of time and care with the production
2015-12-17 23:47:00	@Carson	yeah it seems like he did
2015-12-17 23:47:08	RyanSmallwood	I could end up having my hopes dashed though, so we'll see
2015-12-17 23:47:22	RyanSmallwood	I agree Rogue One and the Rian Johnson ones are also very exciting
2015-12-17 23:47:22	@indeedwatson	i think it will be better
2015-12-17 23:47:29	@Carson	with Star Trek he was also making a new tone to the franchise, more action, less philosophy
2015-12-17 23:47:43	@indeedwatson	but just a bit, I doubt it'll top mad amx for me
2015-12-17 23:47:52	@Carson	with Star Wars it seems like he's emulating New Hope and Empire
2015-12-17 23:48:00	RyanSmallwood	yeah
2015-12-17 23:48:04	@Carson	I'm eh about Mad Max
2015-12-17 23:48:09	@Carson	first watch was fun
2015-12-17 23:48:17	@Carson	but rewatching it is rough
2015-12-17 23:48:29	@Carson	for me at least
2015-12-17 23:48:30	RyanSmallwood	ahh I saw it twice and loved it both times
2015-12-17 23:48:47	RyanSmallwood	I don't expect Star Wars to be better than Mad Max
2015-12-17 23:49:02	@indeedwatson	to me SW seems like it's gonna be more action than adventure, so that's why im comparing it to mad max
2015-12-17 23:49:23	RyanSmallwood	I hope they give it time to breathe
2015-12-17 23:49:35	RyanSmallwood	so many modern blockbusters feel like they're always in such a rush
2015-12-17 23:49:52	@indeedwatson	isn't that part of the definition of a blockbuster almost?
2015-12-17 23:50:15	RyanSmallwood	well older blockbusters spent more time in the stasis before carying you off on the adventure
2015-12-17 23:50:35	@Carson	so to finish my thought, I wonder as globalization increases, I wonder if foreign directors will take majority in the American film industry
2015-12-17 23:51:12	RyanSmallwood	ehh, hollywood has been absorbing tons of foreign talent since the silent era
2015-12-17 23:51:26	@Carson	new blockbusters, cut fast, more explosions, more shooting

2015-12-18 14:39:24	AlexJ44	"Interestingly enough, the very same imbalance in levels of the brain receptor dopamine that causes TS may also be responsible for Žižek's singular insights into cultural phenomena; see Tourette Syndrome, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Creativity. It turns out that this scarcity of dopamine also undermines some of our natural wiring in the brain that tries to filter new ideas, often doing too well a job. People with atypical Tourette
2015-12-18 14:39:24	AlexJ44	 Syndrome are notorious for frequent, breathtakingly creative insights which are often described as counter-intuitive, out-of-the-box and game-changing."

2015-12-18 21:49:37	@Carson	it's okay, not really loving it why?
2015-12-18 21:53:21	tomflint	I watched it the other night
2015-12-18 21:53:28	tomflint	its so weird, but I really enjoyed it
2015-12-18 21:54:47	@Carson	yeah it's oddly satisfying
2015-12-18 21:56:39	tomflint	for me, it really spoke to society's pressure to get married above all else -- even if you don't want to
2015-12-18 21:56:47	tomflint	I loved the forced intimacy
2015-12-18 21:57:21	tomflint	especially how the maid would come give him a shag every day --- which he felt ashamed of due to the lack of connection

2015-12-20 16:57:46	@Carson	damn
2015-12-20 16:58:17	@Carson	Revenant, Creed, Hateful8 screeners out
2015-12-20 16:58:27	@Carson	Sicario too
2015-12-20 17:00:32	thewillmatic__	yeah i saw those
2015-12-20 17:00:38	thewillmatic__	i think sciario might just be the retail blu ray
2015-12-20 17:03:37	@indeedwatson	do you guys watch screeners..?
2015-12-20 17:04:23	@Carson	illegally yes
2015-12-20 17:04:25	thewillmatic__	i have before yea
2015-12-20 17:04:41	@indeedwatson	don't they look like shit?
2015-12-20 17:04:49	thewillmatic__	no, the quality is decent
2015-12-20 17:05:02	thewillmatic__	CAMs are terrible though, i will never watch one
2015-12-20 17:05:14	@indeedwatson	oh, what's the difference?
2015-12-20 17:05:36	@indeedwatson	i rarely watch non-br rips, unless it's a tv show i barely care about, or i can't find it
2015-12-20 17:06:12	thewillmatic__	screeners are usually just DVDRips, CAMs are people with actually pocket camcorders or smartphones in the theatre recording it
2015-12-20 17:06:42	@indeedwatson	i thought that was what screeners were
2015-12-20 17:07:32	thewillmatic__	nah, at least not the correct term. im sure sometimes they are used interchangeably

2015-12-21 13:27:07	lotsoftuna	I did that though once

2015-12-21 15:56:26	Porkepik	I don't mind keeping some classics aside so i don't feel like i'm always watching underground or new stuff

2015-12-21 15:56:53	Porkepik	A fucking classic, still haven't watch it. But i'm sure i will enjoy the movie so i'm keeping it for when i'm tired one night

2015-12-21 16:02:04	@indeedwatson	i would not be hyped for a ridley scott alien....
2015-12-21 16:02:21	Porkepik	Yeah as i said, it's very likely not gonna be good. But still gonna watch it

2015-12-21 16:03:20	Porkepik	but you know, when ridlet scott is "directing" the movie it means he is on the chair and get to have his name on the poster

2015-12-21 16:07:49	lotsoftuna	either /5, /10, /4
2015-12-21 16:07:52	lotsoftuna	whatever it uses
2015-12-21 16:08:19	lotsoftuna	1/5 is poor, but not rubbish, 2/5 is mediocre, 3/5 is average, 4/5 is awesome, 5/5 is fantastic

2015-12-21 16:08:57	Porkepik	ok
2015-12-21 16:08:58	lotsoftuna	I mean, I can't enjoy the film if it isn't quality
2015-12-21 16:09:06	lotsoftuna	My friend didn't like birdman, but I loved it
2015-12-21 16:09:12	Porkepik	Then, how could you enjoy The Room ? ;D
2015-12-21 16:09:15	lotsoftuna	it was a legitimate quality film, both visually and novely
2015-12-21 16:09:22	lotsoftuna	because it's ironically funny
2015-12-21 16:09:25	lotsoftuna	*terrible
2015-12-21 16:09:39	Porkepik	Yeah i know, still ahve to watch it. I have it DLed on my PC
2015-12-21 16:09:56	Porkepik	I don't rate the same way really
2015-12-21 16:10:04	lotsoftuna	I watched The Room in theatre though so
2015-12-21 16:10:06	Porkepik	only use full stars, and it's only depending on my enjoyment.
2015-12-21 16:10:08	lotsoftuna	that's what made it more enjoyable
2015-12-21 16:10:15	lotsoftuna	because the audience really gets into it
2015-12-21 16:10:23	lotsoftuna	if you watch it at home, it'll be less enjoyable unless you have like friends
2015-12-21 16:10:31	lotsoftuna	it's just this awkward, poorly written movie
2015-12-21 16:10:37	lotsoftuna	but it's really funny with an audience
2015-12-21 16:10:38	Porkepik	I'm thinking of getting rid of it cause people don't seem to still be able to understand how it works and are still seeing stars when they should see the label attached to it :/
2015-12-21 16:10:46	lotsoftuna	also why I loved seeing moonrise kingdom and grand budapest in theatres
2015-12-21 16:10:55	lotsoftuna	because the audience added a sort of vibe/life to the film
2015-12-21 16:11:01	lotsoftuna	the reactions, laughs, etc
2015-12-21 16:11:04	lotsoftuna	made it so much ebtter

2015-12-21 22:35:14	Mothravka	Was he cool and nice?
2015-12-21 22:35:31	Card74	My favorite is Rocky VI, the bw short from 1986
2015-12-21 22:36:10	Mothravka	My favourite is The Man Without a Past (2002).
2015-12-21 22:36:12	Card74	Yeah, he's cool. He's a film purist, hates anything digital :)
2015-12-21 22:36:40	Porkepik	I don't know if that's so cool. Digital allows a lot of people to watch movies more often

2015-12-21 22:37:12	Porkepik	Without digital, i wouldn't be able to watch movies. I'm really struggling with money right now
2015-12-21 22:37:20	Mothravka	Maybe he doesn't want a lot of people watching movies more often?
2015-12-21 22:38:16	Card74	He and Bagh ranted a bit about how digital is so lifeless when you compare it to film... I can see where they come from, but I think the wide access is more important.
2015-12-21 22:38:40	Porkepik	Yeah i get it. The experience is better, but i'm still gonna stick to digital

2015-12-22 10:12:48	@Carson	rain everywhere wow
2015-12-22 10:12:59	@indeedwatson	perfect for movies :)
2015-12-22 10:13:24	@Carson	saw The Force Awakens last night in theaters :P
2015-12-22 10:13:44	uguuuu	did you... like it?
2015-12-22 10:13:48	@Carson	heh
2015-12-22 10:14:01	@Carson	I liked it I suppose, it was a good star wars film
2015-12-22 10:14:13	@Carson	but as a film it was okay
2015-12-22 10:14:25	uguuuu	tfw the review you agree with most is armond white's
2015-12-22 10:14:47	@indeedwatson	i'm pretty sure that's how i will feel Carson 
2015-12-22 10:15:36	@Carson	guess it's common for most truefilm people to not like star wars though, with the majority of the public that will mock me for not thinking it's the best thing ever
2015-12-22 10:17:31	@indeedwatson	the SW discussion has 777 comments
2015-12-22 10:17:48	@Carson	watching it was fun none the less, and my fanboy often comes out with some delight
2015-12-22 10:18:18	@indeedwatson	2d?
2015-12-22 10:18:35	@Carson	yeah I saw it in 2d
2015-12-22 10:18:44	uguuuu	the majority of truefilmers seem to like it
2015-12-22 10:19:14	@indeedwatson	ill see it in 3d :/
2015-12-22 10:19:42	zxc	I have never been a SW fan so I am not too interested in seeing it
2015-12-22 10:20:06	@Carson	oh really, well give it time, I'm starting to remember how sloppy some of it was
2015-12-22 10:20:34	@indeedwatson	i went from hating SW without watching anything, to liking all 6 episodes to hating the prequels
2015-12-22 10:20:45	zxc	that is a bit wild
2015-12-22 10:21:02	uguuuu	lol, what happened that you hated star wars without having seen it?
2015-12-22 10:21:34	zxc	I don't hate it - I think I saw one of the movies when I was a young child but I didn't like it even then - but it just doesn't seem appealing to me
2015-12-22 10:22:11	@indeedwatson	uguuuu: i guess similar to how you can hate 50 shades of grey without seeing it
2015-12-22 10:22:12	@Carson	I really liked it as a child, and then I became an adult, started liking real movies
2015-12-22 10:22:18	@Carson	and reality sunk in
2015-12-22 10:22:22	@indeedwatson	i didn't like the aesthetic tbh
2015-12-22 10:23:01	@Carson	this is sacrilege but I rewatched Empire 2 days ago, and a lot of the Battle of Hoth is kind of a bore
2015-12-22 10:23:43	uguuuu	i don't think one should hate 50 shades of grey without seeing it either
2015-12-22 10:24:23	@Carson	most of the action scenes which space ships I start to glaze over
2015-12-22 10:25:16	@indeedwatson	are you trying to trick me into watching 50 shades of grey
2015-12-22 10:25:53	@Carson	50 shades is Twlight fan fiction!
2015-12-22 10:25:55	zxc	I've never been a fan of sci-fi in space, but getting into firefly, battlestar galactica, interstellar, 2001, and a few others have started to change that
2015-12-22 10:26:03	uguuuu	maybe ( ° 3 °)
2015-12-22 10:26:30	@indeedwatson	i think firefly is a bit overrated

2015-12-22 10:28:15	@Carson	Star Wars: for me I'm waiting for funny character interactions in the Falcon, and the small lightsaber duels against the villain, and the mythology that follows
2015-12-22 10:28:47	zxc	while watching it I was shocked thinking "this got cancelled?"

2015-12-22 23:02:20	@indeedwatson	i would say daredevil isn't worth it
2015-12-22 23:02:26	@indeedwatson	but im sure someone might disagree
2015-12-22 23:03:23	RyanSmallwood	they're all going to merge together into The Defenders eventually I take it?
2015-12-22 23:04:08	uguuuu	tfw out of tv shows to watch
2015-12-22 23:04:31	@indeedwatson	just rewatch the wire
2015-12-22 23:04:50	RyanSmallwood	tfw?
2015-12-22 23:04:57	puddy	Daredevil is alright, some interesting character work with the villain, Fisk in the show
2015-12-22 23:05:23	puddy	and it's mostly entertaining and well made
2015-12-22 23:05:36	puddy	but yes, it's part of the MCU assembly line
2015-12-22 23:05:58	@indeedwatson	RyanSmallwood: that feel when
2015-12-22 23:06:17	@indeedwatson	puddy: i found matt really boring
2015-12-22 23:06:33	RyanSmallwood	I'd like to just stick to Jessica Jones if possible, worried things are going to get very crossovery at some point though
2015-12-22 23:06:44	puddy	indeedwatson yeah i mean.. he's not really that interesting of a character
2015-12-22 23:07:10	puddy	or at least the way he's written he's what you'd expect
2015-12-22 23:07:54	@indeedwatson	puddy: something i hadn't thought of why it bored me, until i read a reddit comment: it's tiring that it does the whole origin story all over again in a way that we've seen so many times because superheroes are so popular now
2015-12-22 23:08:09	puddy	yeah that's also it
2015-12-22 23:08:23	puddy	his origin has elements of batman and spider-man
2015-12-22 23:08:45	puddy	i think his relationship with foggy was well done tho
2015-12-22 23:08:57	@indeedwatson	i think jj handled it a bit better
2015-12-22 23:09:05	puddy	yes
2015-12-22 23:09:08	@indeedwatson	i actually liked foggy, even tho he was kinda cheesy
2015-12-22 23:09:20	puddy	he annoyed me the first ep, then grew on me quickly
2015-12-22 23:09:24	puddy	seemed very endearing
2015-12-22 23:09:37	@indeedwatson	i liked the girl too
2015-12-22 23:09:42	puddy	him and karen tho don't get a lot to do
2015-12-22 23:10:16	puddy	they get relegated to the B plot that you don't really care about until it inevitably dovetails into the main plot
2015-12-22 23:10:39	@indeedwatson	i was watching it with a friend and i kept telling her i wished the show was about them
2015-12-22 23:11:05	@indeedwatson	that'd be interesting, a superhero story about a normal person who's the best friend of a hero
2015-12-22 23:11:30	puddy	is that what the show Gotham kinda is about? haven't watched it.
2015-12-22 23:12:05	@indeedwatson	i don't think Gordon counts as Batman's best friend
2015-12-22 23:12:13	@indeedwatson	i haven't seen it either
2015-12-22 23:14:21	puddy	i think i like jj over daredevil but daredevil has some really well done fight scenes
2015-12-22 23:16:04	@indeedwatson	that makes me wonder, RyanSmallwood since you're such a martial arts films fan, what do you think of fights like those in jj
2015-12-22 23:17:03	RyanSmallwood	hmm, I dunno, I feel like kung fu fights are always more stylized
2015-12-22 23:17:31	RyanSmallwood	JJ fights don't impress me as much as HK films, but they fit the mood of the series and seem suitable
2015-12-22 23:17:47	RyanSmallwood	I dunno if I would want more elaborate HK style fighting
2015-12-22 23:17:59	RyanSmallwood	there's probably room for improvement though
2015-12-22 23:18:29	uguuuu	they never... really give the sense that whatsherface actually has superpowers
2015-12-22 23:19:00	@indeedwatson	well she kinda keeps them hidden
2015-12-22 23:19:13	uguuuu	but when she does use them
2015-12-22 23:19:13	@indeedwatson	i should watch more fargo
2015-12-22 23:19:35	@indeedwatson	if she used them fully she'd probably kill people
2015-12-22 23:19:36	uguuuu	it's always the same generic TV-superpower effect of a guy being thrown farther than is phyiscally possible
2015-12-22 23:19:50	puddy	maybe it's cause her superhero powers are boring
2015-12-22 23:20:03	@indeedwatson	yeah
2015-12-22 23:20:11	@indeedwatson	i knida like that
2015-12-22 23:20:15	puddy	so instead of showing the same old shit just focus on her being an emotional wreck trying to fix things in her life
2015-12-22 23:20:48	@indeedwatson	i mentioned that i find odd that most of the cast is women
2015-12-22 23:20:58	puddy	women or minorities
2015-12-22 23:21:06	RyanSmallwood	why's that?
2015-12-22 23:21:07	puddy	except for the evil villain, he's a white male
2015-12-22 23:21:34	puddy	guessing it's to show how progressive the show is
2015-12-22 23:22:00	@indeedwatson	until the cop showed up, the only male characters were the evil controlling man, and the useless junkie
2015-12-22 23:22:14	RyanSmallwood	and the upstairs neighbour
2015-12-22 23:22:19	@indeedwatson	yeah
2015-12-22 23:22:49	RyanSmallwood	a lot of media has terrible representation of women, so its nice to have something balance the scales the other way
2015-12-22 23:23:08	@indeedwatson	it felt like it had a subtle agenda, which i didn't mind but i wonder how much is ticking boxes for a particular audience
2015-12-22 23:23:41	@indeedwatson	tho i guess that applies to most shows
2015-12-22 23:23:47	RyanSmallwood	I dunno if I'd call it an "agenda" so much as making stories for an under-served audience
2015-12-22 23:24:08	@indeedwatson	and also, i can't help but notice how much the director loves to show closeups of walls as characters walk down a hallway out of focus
2015-12-22 23:24:42	RyanSmallwood	I like seeing more complex interaction between female characters, there's sadly usually very little of it
2015-12-22 23:34:08	uguuuu	⎛ ﾟ⌒ﾟ⎞---b
2015-12-22 23:38:48	RyanSmallwood	I also finally saw Star Wars recently
2015-12-22 23:39:25	uguuuu	the new one?
2015-12-22 23:39:30	RyanSmallwood	yup
2015-12-22 23:39:37	uguuuu	good/bad??
2015-12-22 23:39:45	RyanSmallwood	I really liked it
2015-12-22 23:40:07	RyanSmallwood	I grew up on the original trilogy though, so I'm a big star wars fan

2015-12-23 00:46:28	AlexJ44	didn't quite cut if for me
2015-12-23 00:47:37	TempSpastic	damn
2015-12-23 00:47:51	TempSpastic	you had me for a bit AlexJ44
2015-12-23 00:47:52	@Carson	I saw it last night Ryan
2015-12-23 00:48:00	AlexJ44	why so TempSpastic ?
2015-12-23 00:48:22	TempSpastic	we had the same interests
2015-12-23 00:48:29	TempSpastic	we had alison brie
2015-12-23 00:48:33	TempSpastic	but tbh I liked the new star wars
2015-12-23 00:48:36	TempSpastic	this is where we diverge
2015-12-23 00:48:48	AlexJ44	ah man, alison brie
2015-12-23 00:48:57	TempSpastic	she's so fine
2015-12-23 00:49:08	AlexJ44	i'd so have a conversation with her at candlelight
2015-12-23 00:49:32	AlexJ44	and ensure perfect company for the evening. damn
2015-12-23 00:49:44	AlexJ44	anyway, on SW, i've only seen ep IV
2015-12-23 00:50:02	AlexJ44	and I wasn't really moved by it, but maybe I should re-watch
2015-12-23 00:50:10	AlexJ44	it bugs me that everyone likes it but me
2015-12-23 00:50:42	@Carson	I dislike new SW as a film, but think it's a pretty great start for a new star wars franchise
2015-12-23 00:51:01	@Carson	why bring up Brie?
2015-12-23 00:51:11	@Carson	besides obvious reasons
2015-12-23 00:51:57	AlexJ44	we brought her up because of community, as I had forgotten my adoration for the tv show and my huge crush on her
2015-12-23 00:52:03	TempSpastic	obvious reasons carson
2015-12-23 00:52:06	AlexJ44	I haven't yet seen the new sw though
2015-12-23 00:52:11	TempSpastic	you know what, you should throw her in the topic ^^
2015-12-23 00:52:20	@Carson	Alex, go watch Harmontown documentary if you haven't already
2015-12-23 00:52:23	AlexJ44	I'm thinking in watching it tomorrow, as I haven't been to the theater in a while
2015-12-23 00:52:33	AlexJ44	isn't that a series of podcasts?
2015-12-23 00:52:42	@Carson	yes but there is a doc about it
2015-12-23 00:53:00	AlexJ44	let me check
2015-12-23 00:53:00	@Carson	because he does this tour around the country, and it tells you some history of it
2015-12-23 00:53:02	puddy	the description of the doc seems to be about it right after harmon was kicked outta community
2015-12-23 00:53:11	@Carson	when he gets fired from his own show
2015-12-23 00:53:17	@Carson	yes
2015-12-23 00:53:24	@Carson	and ends with him getting rehired
2015-12-23 00:53:28	puddy	lol
2015-12-23 00:53:31	@Carson	spoilers :) but that's old news
2015-12-23 00:53:33	puddy	ridiculous turn of events
2015-12-23 00:53:35	puddy	i know
2015-12-23 00:53:36	AlexJ44	nice, I'm going to DL it
2015-12-23 00:53:40	puddy	it's on netflix
2015-12-23 00:53:44	puddy	if you have that.
2015-12-23 00:53:47	puddy	i've been meaning to watc it
2015-12-23 00:53:49	AlexJ44	you guys are ruining my study-week
2015-12-23 00:53:59	puddy	i listened to some eps of the podcast
2015-12-23 00:53:59	@Carson	I'm a fan of community, but not really into Harmon personally
2015-12-23 00:54:03	AlexJ44	i don't, I don't really like streaming services
2015-12-23 00:54:07	AlexJ44	are the podcasts good?
2015-12-23 00:54:10	puddy	ehh
2015-12-23 00:54:16	@Carson	but found some honorable things about the documentary, you will see what I mean
2015-12-23 00:54:16	AlexJ44	i enjoyed community up until troy was gone, I couldn't watch any further
2015-12-23 00:54:24	AlexJ44	yeah, I'll be sure to check it soon
2015-12-23 00:54:29	AlexJ44	I think i'd have appreciated this more than sciario
2015-12-23 00:54:32	AlexJ44	sicario*
2015-12-23 00:54:36	@Carson	I haven't listen to the podcasts, they have clips of it in the doc though
2015-12-23 00:54:41	puddy	the podcasts aren't that bad but some of the improv stuff i don't really care for
2015-12-23 00:54:42	AlexJ44	I guess I just don't really like denis villeneuve
2015-12-23 00:54:47	puddy	it sounds like it would be better live
2015-12-23 00:55:06	@Carson	I'm currently watching / breaking from that Danny Boyle film Steve Jobs
2015-12-23 00:55:15	AlexJ44	I guess I'll get a community boxset or something if it ever happens
2015-12-23 00:55:20	puddy	usually the first half of the podcast is dan harmon talking about his life/random ideas he's had and that gets a bit interesting
2015-12-23 00:56:01	puddy	and then the second half is improv/d&d stuff that i'm not into
2015-12-23 00:56:09	AlexJ44	dungeons & dragons? what
2015-12-23 00:56:12	AlexJ44	I remember that episode lol
2015-12-23 00:56:15	@Carson	yeah
2015-12-23 00:56:17	puddy	they play 'shadowrun'
2015-12-23 00:56:18	@Carson	he's a fan
2015-12-23 00:56:20	puddy	idk what that is
2015-12-23 00:56:36	@Carson	he did a good job of selling D & D on community
2015-12-23 00:56:40	@Carson	made me actually want to play it
2015-12-23 00:56:46	puddy	the D&D ep of community was brilliant
2015-12-23 00:56:55	@Carson	yes that's what I was talking about
2015-12-23 00:56:58	puddy	and i agree about community being good until troy
2015-12-23 00:57:02	puddy	leaves
2015-12-23 00:57:20	puddy	since a lot of the dynamic was thrown off after that.. it felt hollowed out
2015-12-23 00:57:54	puddy	i only got a couple eps into season 6 but watching it, it feels like the glory years have long past
2015-12-23 00:57:57	AlexJ44	I didn't even get to that episode I think
2015-12-23 00:58:04	AlexJ44	to be honest, I don't really know where I left it
2015-12-23 00:58:28	puddy	i think i skipped most of season 4 since that was the harmon-less season
2015-12-23 00:58:30	AlexJ44	but I had a thing going on with a friend of mine at the time, we were both freshmen and I was abed and he was troy
2015-12-23 00:58:42	AlexJ44	we were cosplaying real life lol
2015-12-23 00:59:05	AlexJ44	we even got to attributing community characters to our rl colleagues. definitely, a lot of free time on our hands
2015-12-23 01:01:13	AlexJ44	but there's some episodes that really stand out: the paintball, the pillow fortress
2015-12-23 01:01:16	AlexJ44	D&D
2015-12-23 01:01:51	AlexJ44	i don't really know how the funding process works on the cable networks, but it always felt to me that community had a very strong fan backing
2015-12-23 01:01:53	puddy	i like the alternate realities episode
2015-12-23 01:02:10	puddy	with each dice roll showing a different alternate reality
2015-12-23 01:02:46	puddy	AlexJ44 i think from what i heard, community gets the same nielsen ratings as rick and morty
2015-12-23 01:03:10	AlexJ44	i tried getting into rick & morty but I didn't like it much
2015-12-23 01:03:15	puddy	and both shows have pretty devoted fanbases, but rick and morty is being shown as a "success" whereas community was always on the brink of failure
2015-12-23 01:03:22	AlexJ44	and yes, that one too. they had so many memorable moments
2015-12-23 01:03:31	AlexJ44	ah, I see your point
2015-12-23 01:05:34	AlexJ44	talking about community makes me want to binge watch the whole thing again lol
2015-12-23 01:05:45	AlexJ44	it's been at least two years
2015-12-23 01:05:55	puddy	i listened to dan harmon talk a bit about writing and stuff
2015-12-23 01:06:06	puddy	he seems to know his shit
2015-12-23 01:06:21	AlexJ44	I don't know much about the character, tbh
2015-12-23 01:06:35	AlexJ44	I really don't know anything about him
2015-12-23 01:07:35	puddy	he's a bit of a narcissist but he knows pop culture and knows story structure
2015-12-23 01:08:30	AlexJ44	it's really one of my favorite sitcoms
2015-12-23 01:08:42	AlexJ44	so is seinfeld, which I watched this year
2015-12-23 01:09:02	TempSpastic	seinfeld is incredible
2015-12-23 01:09:09	TempSpastic	aight we're on the same wavelength again
2015-12-23 01:09:35	puddy	it's amazing how incredible seinfeld is
2015-12-23 01:10:01	AlexJ44	TempSpastic i've started watching louie today, it's nice
2015-12-23 01:10:16	AlexJ44	yeah, I saw a video that someone posted here earlier on, japanese seinfeld lol
2015-12-23 01:10:39	puddy	louie isn't really a sitcom
2015-12-23 01:10:48	puddy	but that show is also brilliant
2015-12-23 01:12:25	AlexJ44	yes, it's a whole different thing
2015-12-23 01:12:33	AlexJ44	but I had no idea what to expect
2015-12-23 01:13:16	AlexJ44	i stopped watching seinfeld at the end of the 5th season, so I wouldn't watch it all on a binge
2015-12-23 01:13:24	AlexJ44	but, guys, no parks & rec love?
2015-12-23 01:14:40	@indeedwatson	never wtched it
2015-12-23 01:15:00	puddy	i missed out on that show
2015-12-23 01:15:44	AlexJ44	I really like it
2015-12-23 01:16:06	AlexJ44	if you enjoyed community, you'll surely like that one as well. got some strong characters too
2015-12-23 01:16:22	puddy	i saw the first ep, reminded me of the office
2015-12-23 01:16:25	AlexJ44	but you must plow through its very mediocre and bland first season. after that, it's a blast
2015-12-23 01:16:30	puddy	ahhh
2015-12-23 01:16:33	puddy	ok
2015-12-23 01:16:33	AlexJ44	no but really, the first season has got nothing on the rest of it
2015-12-23 01:16:49	AlexJ44	i have no idea what they did but they totally changed the series direction
2015-12-23 01:16:50	puddy	i mean i know chris pratt, nick offerman and aziz ansari are on it
2015-12-23 01:17:05	AlexJ44	yeah
2015-12-23 01:17:06	puddy	and those are people i'm interested in
2015-12-23 01:17:22	AlexJ44	the blondie is also very good on it, and the other girl
2015-12-23 01:17:33	@indeedwatson	but no alison brie
2015-12-23 01:17:48	TempSpastic	someone say alison brie
2015-12-23 01:17:49	AlexJ44	aubrey plaza
2015-12-23 01:18:03	@indeedwatson	i prefer alison brie
2015-12-23 01:18:05	AlexJ44	oh and we get rashida jones
2015-12-23 01:18:16	AlexJ44	still no alison brie lol
2015-12-23 01:18:16	TempSpastic	Rashida Jones is also incredible
2015-12-23 01:18:42	AlexJ44	yeah, she looks exotic
2015-12-23 01:19:10	AlexJ44	that's why I asked if anyone had seen mad men, but I guess most of us have the same problem I did
2015-12-23 01:19:16	puddy	i saw mad men
2015-12-23 01:19:16	AlexJ44	it's hard to get gripped to the story
2015-12-23 01:19:18	@indeedwatson	what problem
2015-12-23 01:19:24	@indeedwatson	nope, i love mad men
2015-12-23 01:19:24	AlexJ44	did you like it puddy ?
2015-12-23 01:19:28	AlexJ44	ah, damn
2015-12-23 01:19:30	puddy	didn't finish it AlexJ44
2015-12-23 01:19:32	puddy	but
2015-12-23 01:19:33	puddy	i did like it
2015-12-23 01:19:51	AlexJ44	ok so, maybe that was the problem, people start it but don't finish it
2015-12-23 01:19:57	puddy	it's just after season 5 i felt like it was spinning its wheels, although i've come to realize it's really just a very heavy character show
2015-12-23 01:20:03	AlexJ44	I don't think I've ever made past 5 episodes
2015-12-23 01:20:07	AlexJ44	exactly
2015-12-23 01:20:17	puddy	I made it thru 5 seasons
2015-12-23 01:20:26	AlexJ44	you've obviously seen way more than I did
2015-12-23 01:20:33	AlexJ44	and it has alison brie too!
2015-12-23 01:20:40	puddy	she's not in it enough
2015-12-23 01:20:53	@indeedwatson	ive seen a few seasons multiple times and i awaited each new episode eager
2015-12-23 01:21:05	TempSpastic	love me some trudy campbell
2015-12-23 01:21:13	@indeedwatson	tho i delayed the final episode because i didn't want to finish it
2015-12-23 01:21:58	AlexJ44	I don't know if I'll ever try to watch it again
2015-12-23 01:22:03	AlexJ44	people regard it so highly though
2015-12-23 01:22:37	puddy	i tried rewatching from the start
2015-12-23 01:22:46	puddy	and i kept cringing at how sexist the show is
2015-12-23 01:23:01	puddy	of course it's set during the 50s so it is incredibly sexist
2015-12-23 01:23:04	puddy	and racist
2015-12-23 01:23:21	@indeedwatson	well it's how it was
2015-12-23 01:23:25	@indeedwatson	that's like the point of the show
2015-12-23 01:23:28	puddy	yah
2015-12-23 01:23:37	@indeedwatson	and what makes peggy in particular such a great character
2015-12-23 01:23:40	puddy	yes
2015-12-23 01:23:53	AlexJ44	oh I remember that one
2015-12-23 01:23:56	AlexJ44	the not so cute girl
2015-12-23 01:23:58	puddy	but i can't help but cringe at it
2015-12-23 01:24:14	puddy	not that the writing is bad, it's great
2015-12-23 01:24:33	@indeedwatson	do you cringe with violent shows/movies?
2015-12-23 01:24:41	puddy	no
2015-12-23 01:24:54	@indeedwatson	why do you think that is
2015-12-23 01:24:55	AlexJ44	I might
2015-12-23 01:25:06	AlexJ44	oh, indeedwatson is going to prove a point
2015-12-23 01:25:07	puddy	i grew up on horror
2015-12-23 01:25:14	puddy	and action films
2015-12-23 01:25:18	@indeedwatson	lol no im just curious
2015-12-23 01:25:34	AlexJ44	i say it is because you can't relate to the experience, but with mad men, you're closer to that kind of reality?
2015-12-23 01:25:34	puddy	slowly started to see what the whole feminism thing was about in recent years
2015-12-23 01:25:45	AlexJ44	just my shallow 2 cents
2015-12-23 01:26:05	@indeedwatson	i have a very feminist, lesbian friend
2015-12-23 01:26:12	@indeedwatson	she started watching mad men and i thought she wouldnt like it
2015-12-23 01:26:27	@indeedwatson	a few episodes in, she told me "mad men is gonna turn me straight"
2015-12-23 01:26:31	puddy	lol
2015-12-23 01:26:35	puddy	idk about that
2015-12-23 01:26:43	puddy	christina hendricks
2015-12-23 01:26:47	puddy	mmm
2015-12-23 01:26:58	@indeedwatson	ye that too
2015-12-23 01:27:20	AlexJ44	haha
2015-12-23 01:27:32	AlexJ44	oh I remember that one too
2015-12-23 01:27:36	@indeedwatson	but she ended up binge watching the whole show
2015-12-23 01:27:46	@indeedwatson	and she didn't like JJ
2015-12-23 01:27:47	AlexJ44	she's actually bustier than brie
2015-12-23 01:27:47	@indeedwatson	so idk
2015-12-23 01:27:48	puddy	but yeah kinda what AlexJ44 was saying.. mad men is a bit more real than other shows
2015-12-23 01:28:03	AlexJ44	and she's 40?!
2015-12-23 01:28:07	uguuuu	mad men... is good
2015-12-23 01:28:08	TempSpastic	brie isn't that busty dude she's like a c cup
2015-12-23 01:28:33	AlexJ44	oh, she is TempSpastic
2015-12-23 01:28:33	@indeedwatson	yeah
2015-12-23 01:28:41	@indeedwatson	she's just very cute
2015-12-23 01:28:56	puddy	she's more sex-positive then her characters let on
2015-12-23 01:28:59	AlexJ44	hendricks is just way above average
2015-12-23 01:29:45	TempSpastic	oh I see where you're going
2015-12-23 01:29:46	TempSpastic	fair enough
2015-12-23 01:30:11	puddy	i used to be really into character heavy stuff
2015-12-23 01:30:20	puddy	but i don't have enough time for that anymore
2015-12-23 01:30:28	AlexJ44	like what, puddy ?
2015-12-23 01:30:31	AlexJ44	I don't think I ever did that
2015-12-23 01:30:32	puddy	mad men
2015-12-23 01:30:32	puddy	:D
2015-12-23 01:30:37	AlexJ44	like, the wire?
2015-12-23 01:30:55	@indeedwatson	the wire is real AND violent
2015-12-23 01:30:56	puddy	uhh i wouldn't call the wire a character heavy thing, although it did have well written characters
2015-12-23 01:31:22	puddy	i'm thinking of film/tv where the character was first and foremost and plot was secondary
2015-12-23 01:31:32	puddy	like House M.D.
2015-12-23 01:32:14	puddy	the film, Michael Clayton
2015-12-23 01:32:34	AlexJ44	house got character centric from the 4th season onwards IIRC
2015-12-23 01:32:44	AlexJ44	but I see what you mean
2015-12-23 01:32:46	puddy	there were bits in s1/s2
2015-12-23 01:33:01	puddy	but yeah they ramped it up later on when they added a bunch of new characters
2015-12-23 01:33:07	@indeedwatson	idk how i feel about house
2015-12-23 01:33:39	puddy	i also like when creators subvert a formulaic structure

2015-12-23 01:34:32	@indeedwatson	like?
2015-12-23 01:34:45	puddy	cabin in the woods is the most obvious example to me
2015-12-23 01:34:58	@indeedwatson	oh i thought you meant a tv show
2015-12-23 01:35:04	puddy	season 4 of house i think was the one when they added a bunch of new doctors which was a good mixup
2015-12-23 01:35:16	hubertpoe	can someone recommend a film worth watching that happens to be on netflix?
2015-12-23 01:35:31	AlexJ44	depends on what you enjoyed watching buddy
2015-12-23 01:35:42	AlexJ44	if you're into action, I think there's one that's hard to miss
2015-12-23 01:35:47	AlexJ44	collateral, starring cruise and foxx
2015-12-23 01:35:56	puddy	i havent seen that in forever
2015-12-23 01:36:13	AlexJ44	I've never seen it, tbh, but I recommend it to people and they enjoy it. so it works!
2015-12-23 01:36:28	puddy	I enjoyed it
2015-12-23 01:36:46	hubertpoe	unavailable to stream, apparently. I just watched pontypool. I was not enthralled.
2015-12-23 01:36:52	@indeedwatson	i don't have netflix so can't help there
2015-12-23 01:37:09	AlexJ44	yes, I don't have netflix either

2015-12-23 01:38:26	AlexJ44	I'm not very knowledgeable on it, sorry
2015-12-23 01:39:05	AlexJ44	it was, puddy , that's when 13 came along and all
2015-12-23 01:39:22	puddy	olivia wilde
2015-12-23 01:39:35	AlexJ44	yes
2015-12-23 01:39:46	AlexJ44	we can place her alongside alison brie

2015-12-23 01:55:25	AlexJ44	she's lived here for some 5 or 6 years, so she has something to compare to
2015-12-23 01:55:29	puddy	i didn't actually live there but i visited friends there a couple of times and it seems like a good place to settle down
2015-12-23 01:55:42	AlexJ44	although I don't think you could discard the US as a whole, because of its size
2015-12-23 01:56:06	AlexJ44	what you do have is something I cannot quite understand, which is the cultural bond across all the continent
2015-12-23 01:56:17	puddy	ehh maybe
2015-12-23 01:56:23	AlexJ44	I'm not sure if you can quite understand what I'm saying
2015-12-23 01:56:28	puddy	i guess moreso than South America
2015-12-23 01:56:30	TempSpastic	yeah it's the settling down
2015-12-23 01:56:46	TempSpastic	that's what it's good for and that's what needed to change for me
2015-12-23 01:56:50	AlexJ44	in europe, you have different countries, cultures and languages, whereas in the us it's more general
2015-12-23 01:56:59	AlexJ44	at least that's what I imagine
2015-12-23 01:57:46	puddy	but in reality I don't think people in the U.S. visit too many other states (other than the popular tourist ones)
2015-12-23 01:58:01	puddy	and there can be quite a difference state-to-state
2015-12-23 01:58:20	puddy	there's a lot of subcultures too
2015-12-23 01:58:58	AlexJ44	something I learned a while back while I was doing some radio work
2015-12-23 01:59:34	AlexJ44	is that in the us, if you're working on a niche, you'll still have massive support and financial backing
2015-12-23 01:59:36	TempSpastic	having been to Europe more than a few times I think it's true to an extent between states in the U.S. but it's definitely different in Europe
2015-12-23 02:00:02	AlexJ44	but in europe, the language and cultural barrier is way more noticeable
2015-12-23 02:00:14	puddy	at least they have the rail system?
2015-12-23 02:00:31	AlexJ44	if you're american, and you make, say, a radio show on a very niche genre or culture, you'll have a much bigger audience than in europe
2015-12-23 02:00:43	AlexJ44	basically because you can get your message across to so many more people
2015-12-23 02:00:47	AlexJ44	yes, we do puddy
2015-12-23 02:01:23	AlexJ44	and we have the schengen zone, which means we can cross all borders using only our ID - no passport or visa required
2015-12-23 02:01:56	puddy	and also flights are apparently fairly cheap between different countries in europe
2015-12-23 02:02:19	AlexJ44	yes
2015-12-23 02:02:21	puddy	compared to american flights
2015-12-23 02:02:42	AlexJ44	I'll be visiting the netherlands for 40 euros, with a return flight
2015-12-23 02:02:46	AlexJ44	that's basically 45$
2015-12-23 02:02:50	puddy	yes

2015-12-23 02:05:45	puddy	since you get to see how people operate in a different environment than what you're used to

2015-12-23 02:08:02	AlexJ44	not long, but I think it would really help to move out for a while
2015-12-23 02:08:16	puddy	where to?
2015-12-23 02:08:22	AlexJ44	not europe
2015-12-23 02:08:33	AlexJ44	india, or africa, or asia
2015-12-23 02:08:44	AlexJ44	get a break from the globalized world lol
2015-12-23 02:09:49	puddy	they're just differnet sides of the globalized world

2015-12-23 02:10:35	AlexJ44	yes, surely, but I'm sure you'll get a different lifestyle in a smaller indian town than most of the european cities
2015-12-23 02:10:55	puddy	right
2015-12-23 02:11:07	puddy	and probably diarrhea
2015-12-23 02:11:15	AlexJ44	LOL
2015-12-23 02:11:21	AlexJ44	I'm fond of that curry
2015-12-23 02:11:28	AlexJ44	that wouldn't be a problem
2015-12-23 02:11:36	puddy	not saying it's their curry it's just the diet change
2015-12-23 02:11:41	TempSpastic	Indian food is the best

2015-12-23 12:19:35	Porkepik	RYAN
2015-12-23 12:19:37	Porkepik	HELP
2015-12-23 12:19:43	RyanSmallwood	???
2015-12-23 12:19:52	Porkepik	I can't find the 3 hours version of Le Joli Mai
2015-12-23 12:19:58	Porkepik	So i have a 2 hours and 25 minutes
2015-12-23 12:20:07	Porkepik	But apparently it's suppose to last 3 hours
2015-12-23 12:20:20	@indeedwatson	Porkepik: use a video player to play it in slow motion
2015-12-23 12:20:26	@indeedwatson	profit
2015-12-23 12:22:21	Porkepik	Well i look up the french dvd and it's apparently 2 hours and 25 minutes long
2015-12-23 12:22:30	Porkepik	So i guess IMDB and letterboxd may be wrong
2015-12-23 12:22:55	RyanSmallwood	that's the only cut I know about
2015-12-23 12:23:00	RyanSmallwood	I'll see if I can find more...
2015-12-23 12:23:43	Porkepik	Ok it's legit, even on itunes it's like that
2015-12-23 12:23:59	Porkepik	Gonna watch it today
2015-12-23 12:24:22	RyanSmallwood	I'll be especially curious for your perspective on that one
2015-12-23 12:25:29	Porkepik	There is a cat on the poster, what could go wrong ?
2015-12-23 12:25:34	Porkepik	ACTUALLY 2 CATS !
2015-12-23 12:26:32	RyanSmallwood	so the reason for the shorter cut
2015-12-23 12:26:45	RyanSmallwood	apparently Chris Marker said that on the initial release he was rushed to get the film out
2015-12-23 12:26:59	RyanSmallwood	and there were segments he wanted edited out of the film
2015-12-23 12:27:12	RyanSmallwood	so when they did the restoration in 2009 they cut out the parts he didn't want in the film anymore
2015-12-23 12:30:57	Porkepik	yeah it's actually at the beginning of the movie
2015-12-23 12:30:58	Porkepik	first frame
2015-12-23 12:31:05	Porkepik	it explains, should i read it first :P
2015-12-23 12:31:24	RyanSmallwood	hahahaha
2015-12-23 12:37:44	Porkepik	got a 7.6GB rip of Persona
2015-12-23 12:38:01	Porkepik	and a 4.7GB for Closely Watched Trains
2015-12-23 12:38:48	Porkepik	and 5GB for Daisies, a 74 mins movie
2015-12-23 12:39:12	Porkepik	Should be HQ Bluray 1080p 23.98777777777fps of doom now
2015-12-23 12:39:46	RyanSmallwood	:D :D :D
2015-12-23 12:41:01	Porkepik	23.976*
2015-12-23 12:41:07	Porkepik	I don't know my fps history :/
2015-12-23 12:41:20	Porkepik	Better gotta be accurater
2015-12-23 12:41:25	Porkepik	-s
2015-12-23 12:41:32	Porkepik	i mean r
2015-12-23 12:41:33	Card74	24p is better
2015-12-23 12:41:46	Card74	but it's so rare :(
2015-12-23 12:42:13	Porkepik	Yeah i know ... really sad to miss that 0.124 frame every second :/
2015-12-23 12:42:24	Porkepik	Well in europe it's 24fps i think normally
2015-12-23 12:42:25	Card74	0.024

2015-12-23 12:43:05	themagician	makes films look a lot better
2015-12-23 12:43:09	Porkepik	yeah fuck my math too
2015-12-23 12:44:50	RyanSmallwood	So I actually really like Hegel, and maybe I'm becoming a Hegelian (though that's what I think with every philosopher I read, before it was Wittgenstein and Austin)
2015-12-23 12:44:51	themagician	reclock makes panning scenes look smooth
2015-12-23 12:45:36	themagician	but not 60fps smooth
2015-12-23 12:46:15	Porkepik	It's like me when watching one of these 60's arthouse movie
2015-12-23 12:46:19	Porkepik	It's my new favorite everytime

2015-12-23 12:46:36	RyanSmallwood	I'm really happy you're digging them
2015-12-23 12:47:06	themagician	I wonder if TSPDT is worth completing 100%, I might work on that next year
2015-12-23 12:47:19	RyanSmallwood	how close are you?
2015-12-23 12:47:26	themagician	I haven't worked on that list in like 2 years

2015-12-23 12:48:28	RyanSmallwood	I think its a goal worth working towards, but not on its own
2015-12-23 12:48:48	AlexJ44	you've paved a lot of way into it, themagician
2015-12-23 12:48:54	RyanSmallwood	like I just want to get to the point where I've seen so many movies that I've seen everything on the various top 1000 lists without having directly aimed to complete them
2015-12-23 12:50:47	RyanSmallwood	those top 1000 lists on their own leave out so many fascinating areas of cinema
2015-12-23 12:53:17	RyanSmallwood	I started working through the 1000 films to see before you die, but quit because I was getting interested in so many films that weren't on the list
2015-12-23 12:53:36	Porkepik	(what it means is that there isn't enough wuxia movies in them :P)
2015-12-23 12:55:14	RyanSmallwood	:P
2015-12-23 12:55:35	RyanSmallwood	1000 wuxia films to see before you die
2015-12-23 12:56:27	RyanSmallwood	I'm more than halfway through my viewings for my 1965 video
2015-12-23 12:56:37	RyanSmallwood	dunno how long scripting/editing is going to take
2015-12-23 13:01:40	AlexJ44	you should start organizing it, and putting some well-thought points down on paper
2015-12-23 13:01:47	AlexJ44	it might help later on
2015-12-23 13:01:56	AlexJ44	i'm very curious, though
2015-12-23 13:12:32	RyanSmallwood	Mostly I'm just cutting out the most interesting clips as I watch them, and then when I've watched all the movies I'll study the clips more closely together and build my analysis off of that
2015-12-23 13:16:43	AlexJ44	I'll sponsor your video on my blog
2015-12-23 13:16:57	AlexJ44	by the way, I'm thinking of watching the new star wars tonight
2015-12-23 13:17:01	AlexJ44	I've only seen IV
2015-12-23 13:18:12	Porkepik	But what's gonna be the subject of the video ? Just the year 1965 ?
2015-12-23 13:18:42	Porkepik	Seems tough to isolate a year in cinema without having to talk movies made before
2015-12-23 13:19:12	RyanSmallwood	haha, you're temping me to go full hegel
2015-12-23 13:19:21	RyanSmallwood	first lets start with how thoughts are generated
2015-12-23 13:19:26	RyanSmallwood	now lets go back to the beginning of history
2015-12-23 13:19:29	AlexJ44	haha
2015-12-23 13:19:31	Porkepik	Yep
2015-12-23 13:19:44	RyanSmallwood	then once we've traveled through history from the beginning lets take what we've learned and go back through history again knowing what the end looks like
2015-12-23 13:20:02	AlexJ44	does hegel do that?
2015-12-23 13:20:12	AlexJ44	I can sympathise with that
2015-12-23 13:20:12	Porkepik	That could be the comedic thing in your video, you at the end going full hegel
2015-12-23 13:21:37	AlexJ44	i was reading a bit of kirkegaard, and he refers to hegel all the time I think
2015-12-23 13:24:23	RyanSmallwood	problem is no one wants to read everything Hegel wrote, so they always rely on what they learned about Hegel from other people
2015-12-23 13:29:01	AlexJ44	yeah
2015-12-23 13:29:07	AlexJ44	that happens to me a bit as well
2015-12-23 13:29:11	AlexJ44	I've read more about plato than plato himself
2015-12-23 13:29:30	AlexJ44	i have some really good books on the history of philosphy, and they do a pretty good resume of what their basic ideas were like
2015-12-23 13:29:35	Porkepik	Greek philosophy is important
2015-12-23 13:29:37	AlexJ44	you just can't read everything
2015-12-23 13:30:01	RyanSmallwood	yeah you have to be selective with what you read
2015-12-23 13:30:26	Porkepik	and you watch
2015-12-23 13:30:28	Porkepik	and you play
2015-12-23 13:30:53	@indeedwatson	and listen
2015-12-23 13:30:55	Porkepik	and you fuck
2015-12-23 13:31:12	@indeedwatson	i dont have to be very selective about that
2015-12-23 13:31:18	Porkepik	:|
2015-12-23 13:31:34	RyanSmallwood	by the by Porkepik, the year I was interested in starting at was 1966 when King Hu and Chang Cheh made their first wuxia films, so 1965 is kind of my what was the HK film industry like before Chang Cheh and King Hu video, I could go back further, but I have to pick some practical starting point
2015-12-23 13:31:50	Porkepik	At least you make that 50 yo slighty overweight single woman very happy indeedwatson
2015-12-23 13:32:45	Porkepik	ok cool, is it gonna be spoiler free ?
2015-12-23 13:33:25	RyanSmallwood	I'm going to be kind of selective about it, I might spoil movies I don't think are worth watching in their entirety
2015-12-23 13:33:51	@indeedwatson	Porkepik: not even
2015-12-23 13:34:13	RyanSmallwood	the idea is not to convince people to watch every HK film from 1965, but to give an overview of the industry so they have context for appreciating the important films
2015-12-23 13:34:47	@indeedwatson	a guy is arguing that bluray releases are upscaled dvds
2015-12-23 13:39:29	RyanSmallwood	specific ones, or all bluray?
2015-12-23 13:39:39	RyanSmallwood	Cause I think I've heard of some companies doing that
2015-12-23 13:43:04	AlexJ44	I think you can tell if they're upscaled
2015-12-23 13:43:12	@indeedwatson	nah he's trolling 
2015-12-23 13:44:38	AlexJ44	haha, it happens
2015-12-23 13:45:01	AlexJ44	ah man, I have so much to study yet
2015-12-23 13:45:11	AlexJ44	I don't think I'll make it without losing my sanity
2015-12-23 13:45:40	RyanSmallwood	in general in life, or something specifically you're studying now?
2015-12-23 13:45:57	AlexJ44	in general in life, but more specifically what I'm studying now
2015-12-23 13:45:58	AlexJ44	lol
2015-12-23 13:46:06	RyanSmallwood	what are you studying now?
2015-12-23 13:46:40	Porkepik	computer science ?
2015-12-23 13:47:09	Porkepik	I remember someone studying that
2015-12-23 13:47:21	Porkepik	or weird math i'm not sure
2015-12-23 13:48:07	AlexJ44	yeah, weird math
2015-12-23 13:48:19	AlexJ44	but I'm doing some freshman subjects still
2015-12-23 13:48:37	AlexJ44	although I'm capable of doing more advanced stuff. but yes, I left these behind and now I'm stuck with them. so boring!
2015-12-23 13:48:49	zxc	heh
2015-12-23 13:48:53	zxc	the same thing happened to me
2015-12-23 13:51:01	RyanSmallwood	ooo half in the bag video on force awakens, wonder if they'll do a plinkett review when its out on blu-ray
2015-12-23 13:52:37	AlexJ44	what did you study zxc ?
2015-12-23 13:52:52	zxc	I am studying IT
2015-12-23 13:52:55	AlexJ44	I'm so going to watch that tonight
2015-12-23 13:53:03	AlexJ44	ah yeah, so we have some stuff in common
2015-12-23 13:53:09	zxc	indeed
2015-12-23 13:53:15	AlexJ44	I once had a subject on python 101
2015-12-23 13:53:18	AlexJ44	it was enjoyable, pretty basic too
2015-12-23 13:53:37	AlexJ44	but because I moved colleges, I now have to do the same but in matlab
2015-12-23 13:53:40	zxc	python's great

2015-12-23 13:55:39	AlexJ44	see you!
2015-12-23 13:55:42	zxc	cya!
2015-12-23 14:04:03	@indeedwatson	RyanSmallwood: probably not
2015-12-23 14:04:16	@indeedwatson	from what i know mike quite liked it
2015-12-23 14:04:33	@indeedwatson	but i won't watch it until i see the movie
2015-12-23 14:10:22	RyanSmallwood	do you think you'll see it soon?

2015-12-23 14:41:43	@indeedwatson	maybe they'll do a plinket review once they release space cop but i doubt it'll be sw
2015-12-23 14:43:19	RyanSmallwood	true, they never did a plinkett review for the original trilogy, so I shouldn't assume the new one would automatically get one
2015-12-23 14:43:51	AlexJ44	what's a plinkett review?

2015-12-23 14:48:41	@indeedwatson	there's one review for each of the prequels
2015-12-23 14:48:48	RyanSmallwood	its also very very very good
2015-12-23 14:49:24	@indeedwatson	they hit the sweet spot between good criticism and humor/entertainment
2015-12-23 14:49:33	RyanSmallwood	yeah
2015-12-23 14:49:59	AlexJ44	i've never seen this
2015-12-23 14:50:07	AlexJ44	let me check other content of his
2015-12-23 14:50:11	RyanSmallwood	I wouldn't normally endorse some of the plothole criticism, but its usually presented in a funny way between the good arguments
2015-12-23 14:50:38	RyanSmallwood	so I take those points as just having fun at the prequels expense
2015-12-23 14:51:13	AlexJ44	lol I love how he seems so drunk
2015-12-23 14:51:23	@indeedwatson	AlexJ44: they have a few reviews in that format, but most are in the half in the bag format, and they also have best of the worst, where they watch 3 B-movies and comment on them
2015-12-23 14:51:38	@indeedwatson	ive seen most of their content
2015-12-23 14:51:56	@indeedwatson	if you want to watch a half in the bag episode later, i recommend the one on jack & jill
2015-12-23 14:51:58	AlexJ44	well it seems mostly sci-fi and nerd stuff
2015-12-23 14:52:12	RyanSmallwood	I definitely recommend seeing all the prequel reviews in their entirety when you find the time for it
2015-12-23 14:52:52	AlexJ44	nah, I haven't found a plinkett review on a film i've seen
2015-12-23 14:53:09	AlexJ44	by the way, have you seen star trek?

2015-12-23 14:56:09	RyanSmallwood	I've watched some of the series
2015-12-23 14:56:12	RyanSmallwood	and some of the movies
2015-12-23 14:56:13	AlexJ44	this is really funny lol
2015-12-23 14:56:17	RyanSmallwood	yup yup :)
2015-12-23 14:59:20	AlexJ44	ha, it's nice when they're describing the characters
2015-12-23 14:59:33	AlexJ44	that was really smart

2015-12-23 15:07:29	Porkepik	Do you think video games are art ?
2015-12-23 15:08:16	@indeedwatson	yes
2015-12-23 15:10:44	Porkepik	Ok, well we can go back to SW now :D
2015-12-23 15:10:51	@indeedwatson	lol
2015-12-23 15:10:54	RyanSmallwood	its sort of a tricky question
2015-12-23 15:10:55	@indeedwatson	i think it's a silly question
2015-12-23 15:11:13	RyanSmallwood	cause video games combine things that we traditionally consider art with things we don't traditionally consider art
2015-12-23 15:11:26	AlexJ44	i saw a 7 minute resume of star wars
2015-12-23 15:11:31	AlexJ44	leia and luke are brothers? SICKO
2015-12-23 15:12:06	@indeedwatson	RyanSmallwood: which of the 2nd category?
2015-12-23 15:12:30	Porkepik	technically, i saw that some people don't consider video games art cause you're playing it
2015-12-23 15:12:36	RyanSmallwood	like I don't think we'd normally consider a game of ping pong art
2015-12-23 15:12:39	Porkepik	it's closer to pure "entertainment"
2015-12-23 15:12:56	AlexJ44	hey, but what about chess
2015-12-23 15:13:06	Card74	e2-e4
2015-12-23 15:13:08	RyanSmallwood	video games combine elements from games we don't  consider art, with things we do
2015-12-23 15:13:21	@indeedwatson	well that's like saying i wouldn't consider my videos of me exercising for formchecks, art, hence film making isn't art
2015-12-23 15:13:29	AlexJ44	brian eno once said that art and culture is everything we don't really need to do
2015-12-23 15:13:41	Porkepik	Fuck, a lot is art now
2015-12-23 15:13:43	@indeedwatson	so fapping is art?
2015-12-23 15:13:57	Porkepik	I M MAKING ART ! I knew it !
2015-12-23 15:14:08	RyanSmallwood	well I follow Wittgenstein in the sense that it doesn't make sense to ask what a word is, because we use them in different contexts
2015-12-23 15:14:11	Porkepik	Art is a big subject in philosophy
2015-12-23 15:14:11	@indeedwatson	the most prolific artist to ever live
2015-12-23 15:14:31	zxc	AlexJ44: there is definitely art in chess, and in many competitive games
2015-12-23 15:14:49	@indeedwatson	RyanSmallwood: i think the context in which everyone asks this is: film, painting, etc, those are clearly art, are videogames too?
2015-12-23 15:14:50	AlexJ44	haha
2015-12-23 15:14:58	AlexJ44	I've been doing a lot of art lately lol
2015-12-23 15:15:17	RyanSmallwood	there's no metaphysical truth to what art is
2015-12-23 15:15:17	AlexJ44	I'd say: of course
2015-12-23 15:15:21	Porkepik	I don't know, i tried to read a bit when i had philosphy in high school, it's very interesting but hard to have a precise idea before reading a lot
2015-12-23 15:15:48	Porkepik	my teacher was also so fucking shit
2015-12-23 15:15:49	RyanSmallwood	I can talk about "the parts to make a boat" or talk about "half a boat" or talk about "a drawing of a boat" without asking "but are those things really boats!?!?!"
2015-12-23 15:16:28	RyanSmallwood	the word art can be used to talk about aspects of video games, but investigating the metaphysical truth of "But IS IT art!?!?" is a philosophical dead end
2015-12-23 15:16:28	Porkepik	Ceci n'est pas une pipe :O
2015-12-23 15:16:40	RyanSmallwood	language is not that rigid
2015-12-23 15:16:56	@indeedwatson	yeah but like i said, everyone takes for granted that films, books, ARE actually art
2015-12-23 15:17:23	RyanSmallwood	there are things that fit well within our notions and things that partially fit
2015-12-23 15:17:27	AlexJ44	omelette du fromage
2015-12-23 15:17:42	Porkepik	Woaw Alex ! You can speak french ! You look so clever !
2015-12-23 15:17:47	Porkepik	you should make reviews online
2015-12-23 15:17:54	AlexJ44	is the book i have on pilates' 10 best starting positions art?
2015-12-23 15:17:55	@indeedwatson	mise en scene
2015-12-23 15:17:57	RyanSmallwood	which is what I mean when I say video games combine things we traditionally call art with things we traditionally don't

2015-12-23 15:18:30	Porkepik	To talk about that avant garde film noir with some déjà vu mise en scene. It's a must watch and a rendez vous for lover of cinema and films.
2015-12-23 15:18:54	@indeedwatson	RyanSmallwood: that applies to other stuff, i don't think many would consider the most technical aspects of film making as art, or say, tuning an instrument
2015-12-23 15:19:15	Porkepik	But they're not part of the final product tho
2015-12-23 15:19:24	@indeedwatson	sadly i gotta go, bbl
2015-12-23 15:19:30	RyanSmallwood	flip you way of thinking of the world, use words to investigate the world, don't expect the world to explain how are words work

2015-12-23 15:27:17	RyanSmallwood	I occasionally hear people saying buddhism solved certain issues of western philosophy a long time ago, but I haven't heard any recommendations on specific texts I could read that would help me with the problems I'm interested in
2015-12-23 15:28:10	RyanSmallwood	my goal is to read as little philosophy as possible, because I think most philosophers make up pointless problems, but if I hear about a philosopher who I think is helpful I try to engage with their work
2015-12-23 15:32:27	RyanSmallwood	I like Wittgenstein and Austin because to me they solve 90% of the problems that philosophers worried about for thousands of years.  There were a few areas of their thought I didn't find 100% satisfactory, and I find Hegel has some better ways of approaching those issues
2015-12-23 15:33:10	Porkepik	Hegel fixed issues so we could go back to pointless problems
2015-12-23 15:35:07	RyanSmallwood	I don't think Hegel leads us to pointless problems :/

2015-12-23 19:23:27	RyanSmallwood	3D was fine, but I think a few times they overemphasize the 3D effect and it makes things look smaller

2015-12-23 19:24:00	RyanSmallwood	like big far away things don't have a lot of depth, so when they accentuate the 3D it looks more like a model in your face than a big spaceship
2015-12-23 19:24:05	@indeedwatson	RyanSmallwood: oh you already watched it?
2015-12-23 19:24:12	RyanSmallwood	yup yup
2015-12-23 19:24:16	@indeedwatson	cool
2015-12-23 19:24:27	@indeedwatson	i'd go to 2d but the imax only shows it in 3d
2015-12-23 19:24:37	RyanSmallwood	yeah, that's what I ended up doing
2015-12-23 19:24:52	RyanSmallwood	I'll probably see it again in 2D before it leaves theaters
2015-12-23 19:25:31	Porkepik	gonna watch it next month
2015-12-23 19:25:45	AlexJ44	i'll be back later in the evening though
2015-12-23 19:25:54	@indeedwatson	have fun
2015-12-23 19:25:57	AlexJ44	to give you my review
2015-12-23 19:26:05	@indeedwatson	your no stars review
2015-12-23 19:26:16	Porkepik	a review of what ?
2015-12-23 19:26:24	AlexJ44	lol indeedwatson :P
2015-12-23 19:26:27	RyanSmallwood	no stars cause the stars went to war and all died :(
2015-12-23 19:26:30	AlexJ44	I don't really care for stars
2015-12-23 19:26:34	@indeedwatson	AlexJ44: oh what did you think of sicario
2015-12-23 19:26:42	AlexJ44	I didn't like it much
2015-12-23 19:26:47	@indeedwatson	D:
2015-12-23 19:26:50	AlexJ44	if I had to star it
2015-12-23 19:26:54	AlexJ44	it would be 3 or 3.5
2015-12-23 19:27:00	Mothravka	That's good?
2015-12-23 19:27:03	Porkepik	out of 10 ?
2015-12-23 19:27:05	AlexJ44	out of 5
2015-12-23 19:27:06	@indeedwatson	that's pretty good
2015-12-23 19:27:08	Porkepik	oooooh
2015-12-23 19:27:16	AlexJ44	but considering half stars, it would be like a 7
2015-12-23 19:27:20	@indeedwatson	i think i gave it a 3.5
2015-12-23 19:27:22	AlexJ44	ok maybe 3 definitely
2015-12-23 19:27:23	Porkepik	gotta be accurate, some people rate out of 100
2015-12-23 19:27:23	AlexJ44	a 6
2015-12-23 19:27:32	Porkepik	soon gonna be out of 666 or 237
2015-12-23 19:27:34	@indeedwatson	3.74/100
2015-12-23 19:27:38	AlexJ44	lol
2015-12-23 19:27:48	@indeedwatson	no kiding, a dude in another channel gave the martian book a 5/7
2015-12-23 19:27:50	AlexJ44	but yeah, I was a bit distracted too
2015-12-23 19:27:56	AlexJ44	so I might have missed on some symbolism
2015-12-23 19:28:04	RyanSmallwood	how many bags of popcorn would you give it?
2015-12-23 19:28:08	AlexJ44	I thought it was a bit bland
2015-12-23 19:28:16	AlexJ44	at most, 1 bag
2015-12-23 19:28:17	@indeedwatson	did you notice how it turned action tropes on its head?
2015-12-23 19:28:19	AlexJ44	if I had 10 bags
2015-12-23 19:28:24	AlexJ44	not really
2015-12-23 19:28:30	AlexJ44	what do you mean?
2015-12-23 19:28:32	AlexJ44	the girl being a coward?
2015-12-23 19:28:37	@indeedwatson	instead of a car chase, it has a traffic jam
2015-12-23 19:28:44	AlexJ44	yeah,
2015-12-23 19:28:47	Porkepik	OK TELL ME WHEN I CAN LOOK AWAY
2015-12-23 19:28:49	AlexJ44	and there was no truly action section
2015-12-23 19:28:51	Porkepik	I M TRYING NOT TO READ
2015-12-23 19:28:56	AlexJ44	oh sorry porke
2015-12-23 19:28:57	@indeedwatson	oh sorry
2015-12-23 19:28:59	Porkepik	:D
2015-12-23 19:29:08	Porkepik	It's ok, my fault for not seeing it
2015-12-23 19:29:13	AlexJ44	it was a very tense traffic jam though
2015-12-23 19:29:15	Mothravka	I love traffic jams and no action.
2015-12-23 19:29:16	AlexJ44	but apart from that...
2015-12-23 19:29:30	AlexJ44	I thought the tunnel scene didn't really work
2015-12-23 19:30:14	Porkepik	fuck i meant "tell me when i can stop looking away"
2015-12-23 19:30:15	@indeedwatson	i thought it was interesting 
2015-12-23 19:30:30	Porkepik	Now i sound like a dick
2015-12-23 19:30:46	@indeedwatson	Porkepik: i understood what you were trying to say
2015-12-23 19:30:46	AlexJ44	even that final twist...
2015-12-23 19:30:52	AlexJ44	yeah I did too Porkepik
2015-12-23 19:31:07	@indeedwatson	AlexJ44: plot wise it's not amazing but i loved the tone
2015-12-23 19:31:14	AlexJ44	no one else would, but we're acquainted to you now
2015-12-23 19:31:18	@indeedwatson	and the characters were interesting enough
2015-12-23 19:31:25	AlexJ44	well somewhat
2015-12-23 19:31:27	@indeedwatson	yes Porkepik we know you're special
2015-12-23 19:31:30	AlexJ44	I don't know
2015-12-23 19:31:32	AlexJ44	I didn't like enemy much either
2015-12-23 19:32:11	AlexJ44	she was hot though, emily blunt
2015-12-23 19:32:29	Mothravka	Sicario (2015) was actually a good Hollywood/major film from America. For once.
2015-12-23 19:32:30	AlexJ44	she could be my very own policegirl
2015-12-23 19:32:39	AlexJ44	did you watch it Mothravka ?
2015-12-23 19:32:42	Mothravka	Yeah.
2015-12-23 19:32:55	AlexJ44	like, it's way better than most action films
2015-12-23 19:32:58	@indeedwatson	theater?
2015-12-23 19:33:00	AlexJ44	at least, it is diferent
2015-12-23 19:33:10	AlexJ44	but I really didn't get any special anything out of ti
2015-12-23 19:33:11	AlexJ44	it*
2015-12-23 19:33:30	Mothravka	Yeah. I rated it 3 out of 5.
2015-12-23 19:33:38	AlexJ44	see? we're very coherent on our ratings
2015-12-23 19:33:48	@indeedwatson	if anything, that shot of the silhouettes walking down into the horizon was so good
2015-12-23 19:34:00	AlexJ44	hmmmmmmm
2015-12-23 19:34:02	AlexJ44	I don't recall that one
2015-12-23 19:34:05	@indeedwatson	AlexJ44: but to Mothravka 3 stars probably means more than what 3 stars mean to you
2015-12-23 19:34:13	AlexJ44	yes, I thought of that too
2015-12-23 19:34:15	Mothravka	Probably.
2015-12-23 19:34:18	AlexJ44	so maybe I should adjust to 2,5
2015-12-23 19:34:35	AlexJ44	but that ocurred to me as well lol
2015-12-23 19:34:38	Mothravka	On the other hand, I only use full star ratings, so that can be a difference too.
2015-12-23 19:35:02	Mothravka	Different people have different systems.
2015-12-23 19:35:23	@indeedwatson	ye
2015-12-23 19:35:37	AlexJ44	ok so you meant to give a 2.5 and it rounded up
2015-12-23 19:35:43	@indeedwatson	i just think of a movie and it "feels" like a 7 or an 8 or whatever
2015-12-23 19:35:50	AlexJ44	it's coolio mothravka
2015-12-23 19:36:00	AlexJ44	ok indeedwatson , this one I wouldn't rewatch
2015-12-23 19:36:09	Porkepik	Hello Mothravka
2015-12-23 19:36:10	AlexJ44	but there's plenty I would rewatch, even if it wasn't right now
2015-12-23 19:36:16	Mothravka	Hey there.
2015-12-23 19:36:21	@indeedwatson	i would in some time or if friends wanted to
2015-12-23 19:36:21	Porkepik	So you didn't like Paul Blart ? :O
2015-12-23 19:36:27	@indeedwatson	blasphemy
2015-12-23 19:36:30	Porkepik	Paul Blart 2 ?!
2015-12-23 19:36:30	AlexJ44	eermmm
2015-12-23 19:36:32	AlexJ44	I'm not sure I would
2015-12-23 19:36:52	Mothravka	Porkepik: Not as good as Tarkovsky's films.
2015-12-23 19:37:08	AlexJ44	well guys
2015-12-23 19:37:10	AlexJ44	I gotta go soon
2015-12-23 19:37:15	Mothravka	But I look forward to a third one.
2015-12-23 19:37:22	AlexJ44	but first: has any of you seen buried (2010)?
2015-12-23 19:37:27	@indeedwatson	AlexJ44: enjoy sw
2015-12-23 19:37:42	Porkepik	Bye bye AlexJ44
2015-12-23 19:37:48	@indeedwatson	im now picturing paul blart rolling into The Zone in his segway
2015-12-23 19:37:52	Mothravka	No, never cared to check it out really.
2015-12-23 19:37:54	Mothravka	Heh.
2015-12-23 19:37:59	@indeedwatson	and pondering about his deepest desires
2015-12-23 19:38:03	Porkepik	Should i watch Paul Blart ? Cause it seems like it's as important as the last SW
2015-12-23 19:38:09	AlexJ44	It's good
2015-12-23 19:38:10	Mothravka	Yes!
2015-12-23 19:38:12	Porkepik	wouldn't want someone to spoil me Paul fate
2015-12-23 19:38:32	AlexJ44	i'd watch paul blart
2015-12-23 19:38:39	AlexJ44	I would rewatch it just as it had finished
2015-12-23 19:38:46	Mothravka	I'd watch it with you.
2015-12-23 19:38:49	Mothravka	Again!
2015-12-23 19:38:58	Porkepik	I was about to watch Le Joli Mai from Marker, the guy who made La Jetée. But Paul Blart seems better and more important to my studying of cinema
2015-12-23 19:39:11	AlexJ44	well
2015-12-23 19:39:14	AlexJ44	goodbye folks
2015-12-23 19:39:18	AlexJ44	i'll be around in 3h or so
2015-12-23 19:39:19	@indeedwatson	Porkepik: i'd just wait for the director's cut, i hear it's gonna be 5 hours long
2015-12-23 19:39:20	Mothravka	It's a thin line.
2015-12-23 19:39:21	AlexJ44	see you

2015-12-23 22:11:29	puddy	oh nice one of those video essay channels
2015-12-23 22:12:47	puddy	i like that this is becoming a thing now
2015-12-23 22:13:24	@indeedwatson	yeah
2015-12-23 22:13:48	@indeedwatson	some channels seem to be jumping on the bandwagon but not really hitting the same level as EFaP 
2015-12-23 22:13:56	@indeedwatson	but to me nerdwriter does, sometimes
2015-12-23 22:13:57	puddy	right
2015-12-23 22:14:35	puddy	Rob Ager has been doing it for a while, although his editing style is not as sleek as EFaP
2015-12-23 22:15:12	puddy	he has well articulated ideas on the subconcious/psychological elements encoded in films

2015-12-23 22:16:28	@indeedwatson	but it's nice that he also writes articles

2015-12-23 22:22:18	@indeedwatson	Card74: do you have a kindle?
2015-12-23 22:22:33	Card74	Yup, Paperwhite 2nd generation
2015-12-23 22:23:17	Card74	since shipping to EU is so expensive, it makes sense for me to buy the ebooks
2015-12-23 22:23:35	Card74	...although using the library more would be sensible, too...
2015-12-23 22:24:30	Card74	If you read a lot, don't skimp on the reader. Get the Kindle Voyage, even though it's expensive.
2015-12-23 22:25:09	@indeedwatson	i have pw 3rd gen
2015-12-23 22:25:29	Card74	good, good :p
2015-12-23 22:25:32	@indeedwatson	but living in argentina, it cost me about 200usd
2015-12-23 22:25:41	Card74	ouch
2015-12-23 22:25:50	@indeedwatson	the voyage is almost 500...
2015-12-23 22:25:58	Card74	shipping + customs?
2015-12-23 22:26:35	@indeedwatson	that'd probably be cheaper but more complicated, becauser imports are heavily taxed and limited

2015-12-23 22:29:08	Card74	I should reorganize the Kindle... there's some book or article which is messing with the Kindle's indexing algorithm
2015-12-23 22:29:32	Card74	meaning that I can't see every new ebook / article I load on it. :(
2015-12-23 22:29:44	Card74	Annoying as hell
2015-12-23 22:30:31	@indeedwatson	i don't think i even have more than 50 books loaded on it
2015-12-23 22:30:49	@indeedwatson	i really wish there was a jailbreak for the latest kindle OS
2015-12-23 22:31:07	Card74	The Amazon purchases appear, it's the manually loaded books / articles that are sometimes missing.
2015-12-23 22:32:00	@indeedwatson	i hope that doesn't happen to me cause manually loaded books and articles is all i have 
2015-12-23 22:32:31	Card74	if it does, removing the broken book resolves the problem
2015-12-23 22:32:48	Card74	of course, first you have to identify which book / article causes it...
2015-12-23 22:33:20	puddy	maybe it depends on the format of the content?
2015-12-23 22:33:24	puddy	pdf/mobi/whatever
2015-12-23 22:33:41	puddy	i have one of the early kindles that don't use the android OS fork
2015-12-23 22:33:55	puddy	works well enough
2015-12-23 22:34:12	Card74	That's what Calibre's documentation said - convert it to something else once you figure out which book causes it
2015-12-23 22:39:59	Card74	indeedwatson: Oh right, if you decide to read Vernor Vinge, the proper order is A Fire Upon the Deep first, then A Deepness in the Sky.  A Deepness... is a prequel, and tells you things you shouldn't know before reading A Fire...
2015-12-23 22:40:33	Card74	great books, both of them

2015-12-23 23:03:43	AlexJ44	just got back for SW
2015-12-23 23:04:18	TempSpastic	Whatchu think
2015-12-23 23:05:08	AlexJ44	it's not that good
2015-12-23 23:05:16	AlexJ44	it has its moments though
2015-12-23 23:05:42	AlexJ44	it's hard to judge films like these on their own merits, because you'll always be tinted by nostalgia and the whole franchise
2015-12-23 23:07:14	TempSpastic	agreed
2015-12-23 23:08:16	AlexJ44	the girl is a hottie
2015-12-23 23:08:18	AlexJ44	and the black is funny
2015-12-23 23:08:32	TempSpastic	agreed on both accounts
2015-12-23 23:08:36	AlexJ44	and I won't tell you anything else because I really don't want to spoil it
2015-12-23 23:09:14	TempSpastic	I've seen it but yeah for the other people in the chat who haven't it's best not to spoil
2015-12-23 23:12:37	AlexJ44	it felt a bit rushed sometimes
2015-12-23 23:13:42	Card74	I saw some great analysis about it today
2015-12-23 23:14:19	RyanSmallwood	you're crazy AlexJ44

2015-12-23 23:16:08	Porkepik	I don't know how documentaries where really made before
2015-12-23 23:16:16	AlexJ44	what are you talking about?

2015-12-23 23:16:44	Porkepik	So obviously, can't say how groundbreaking it was
2015-12-23 23:16:55	AlexJ44	are you talking about Le Joli Mai?
2015-12-23 23:17:02	RyanSmallwood	Porkepik:  was blown away by Le Joli Mai, AlexJ44, you're crazy for thinking Star Wars was not that great

2015-12-23 23:17:18	AlexJ44	wait
2015-12-23 23:17:20	puddy	interesting article Card74
2015-12-23 23:17:23	AlexJ44	does tony zhou also write?
2015-12-23 23:17:52	@indeedwatson	apparently that's his only article
2015-12-23 23:17:53	@indeedwatson	lol
2015-12-23 23:17:58	RyanSmallwood	Porkepik: its following the style of Jean Rouch's Chronicle of a Summer, but I think its more interesting
2015-12-23 23:18:05	Porkepik	Now, i have my own view on the world, and the politics at the time
2015-12-23 23:18:19	AlexJ44	is le joli mai good even for those with no historical background on it?
2015-12-23 23:18:23	Porkepik	So ... I was really touched by the stories
2015-12-23 23:18:55	RyanSmallwood	AlexJ44: I found it harder to fully evaluate without context, but its still very good to watch regardless
2015-12-23 23:19:15	Porkepik	It was powerful to see their views on what was happening. Going from a almost deny of it to a deep militantism
2015-12-23 23:19:30	@indeedwatson	i felt the same way about eros + massacre
2015-12-23 23:19:35	@indeedwatson	i still don't know the context tho
2015-12-23 23:19:35	Porkepik	Yeah, i guess it's because i'm french and it was easier for me to understand
2015-12-23 23:20:15	Porkepik	Algerian war
2015-12-23 23:20:26	Porkepik	Was a big subject during the new wave

2015-12-23 23:21:44	Porkepik	It was biased but somehow, i felt like marker and his interviewer were almost part of talk
2015-12-23 23:21:54	Card74	thanks :)
2015-12-23 23:21:57	puddy	it's a very interesting interpretation of ep 7
2015-12-23 23:22:04	Porkepik	part of the talk*
2015-12-23 23:22:21	RyanSmallwood	well that was the theory Jean Rouch was working with
2015-12-23 23:22:40	RyanSmallwood	since you can't be 100% objective acknowledge the filmmakers
2015-12-23 23:23:20	RyanSmallwood	Chris Marker makes very personal documentaries
2015-12-23 23:23:35	Porkepik	Yeah, i'm so excited about his other works
2015-12-23 23:23:44	Porkepik	He has more popular documentaries, now i really want to watch them !
2015-12-23 23:24:03	Porkepik	Sunless especially
2015-12-23 23:24:30	RyanSmallwood	that's one we say in French to sound cool

2015-12-23 23:24:54	Porkepik	:D
2015-12-23 23:25:01	RyanSmallwood	yup :D
2015-12-23 23:25:26	Porkepik	Would want to hear an english say it
2015-12-23 23:26:07	RyanSmallwood	and Le Joli Mai is part of the Cinéma Vérité style
2015-12-23 23:26:14	RyanSmallwood	:D :D :D
2015-12-23 23:26:17	Porkepik	Another french term :O
2015-12-23 23:26:20	Porkepik	They're everywhere
2015-12-23 23:26:23	Porkepik	Please let us alone !
2015-12-23 23:26:44	RyanSmallwood	but we don't use Japanese names, cause that's too hard...

2015-12-23 23:32:37	AlexJ44	has anyone seen the end of the tour'
2015-12-23 23:33:37	RyanSmallwood	AlexJ44: just curious do you like any big action movies?
2015-12-23 23:33:50	AlexJ44	not really no
2015-12-23 23:33:56	RyanSmallwood	ah, gotya
2015-12-23 23:34:01	AlexJ44	BUT - i liked mad max
2015-12-23 23:34:08	AlexJ44	^^'
2015-12-23 23:34:16	AlexJ44	is that question related to SW?
2015-12-23 23:34:30	RyanSmallwood	but you weren't crazy about MM right?
2015-12-23 23:35:00	AlexJ44	no, but I think I enjoyed it a little more than this one
2015-12-23 23:35:07	RyanSmallwood	kk
2015-12-23 23:35:16	AlexJ44	I guess I was just expecting a bit more, which probably wouldn't fit in this genre anyhow
2015-12-23 23:35:40	AlexJ44	it had some really silly moments
2015-12-23 23:36:11	AlexJ44	but then again, a) it's a disney franchise now and b) it is part of a bigger concept so we must have that in mind
2015-12-23 23:36:51	TempSpastic	Can anyone testify to John Woo's films
2015-12-23 23:36:59	RyanSmallwood	I'm biased cause I grew up on the original trilogy, but I thought they did much better than most action movies
2015-12-23 23:37:08	RyanSmallwood	TempSpastic: John Woo is great
2015-12-23 23:37:18	puddy	what's MM?
2015-12-23 23:37:21	TempSpastic	nice
2015-12-23 23:37:21	AlexJ44	mad max
2015-12-23 23:37:24	puddy	oh
2015-12-23 23:37:25	RyanSmallwood	his HK stuff anyway, haven't seen too much American films
2015-12-23 23:37:30	AlexJ44	yeah, I didn't grow with the originals
2015-12-23 23:37:36	TempSpastic	I'm looking at Hard Boiled now
2015-12-23 23:37:37	AlexJ44	I've seen IV and this new one
2015-12-23 23:37:41	puddy	i wouldn't call star wars action films really
2015-12-23 23:37:49	AlexJ44	yeah, it's not really action
2015-12-23 23:38:00	RyanSmallwood	Hard Boiled has his best action scenes
2015-12-23 23:38:02	AlexJ44	if it were, i would maybe say it was a bit poor in that regard
2015-12-23 23:38:18	puddy	it's different then indiana jones adventure too but it does involve lots of special effects colldiing together
2015-12-23 23:38:18	AlexJ44	i don't know
2015-12-23 23:38:21	puddy	in a good way
2015-12-23 23:38:23	RyanSmallwood	action/adventure speaking broadly
2015-12-23 23:38:32	AlexJ44	maybe I'd like star trek moer
2015-12-23 23:38:34	AlexJ44	more*
2015-12-23 23:38:59	AlexJ44	by the way RyanSmallwood , what about ep II and III? are they as bad as I?
2015-12-23 23:39:07	RyanSmallwood	I didn't like the abrams ST as much as SW
2015-12-23 23:39:14	RyanSmallwood	AlexJ44: much worse
2015-12-23 23:39:37	RyanSmallwood	the romance scenes are so creepy and horrible to watch

2015-12-24 13:17:58	@indeedwatson	i was going to ask that but i thought it'd be better not to judge
2015-12-24 13:18:07	lotsoftuna	http://puu.sh/m7fYT.jpg
2015-12-24 13:18:09	lotsoftuna	I deleted it
2015-12-24 13:22:32	Porkepik	I watched The Fault of our Stars, and i couldn't like the movie
2015-12-24 13:22:42	Porkepik	I thought the cast made it look like a joke :/
2015-12-24 13:22:54	Porkepik	Seriously, no real bad acting, but it wasn't that good either
2015-12-24 13:23:04	Porkepik	I guess the book may be more interesting
2015-12-24 13:23:29	RyanSmallwood	I liked the book better, but they're pretty similar, advantage of the book is if you don't like the cast or music
2015-12-24 13:23:33	RyanSmallwood	still need to watch Paper Towns
2015-12-24 13:23:50	Porkepik	Arf ... That one is gonna be tough for me to like :/
2015-12-24 13:24:00	RyanSmallwood	why's that?
2015-12-24 13:24:04	Porkepik	I can't stand delevingne
2015-12-24 13:24:28	RyanSmallwood	I don't know her from other stuff
2015-12-24 13:24:36	RyanSmallwood	except that I'm aware of other stuff she's from
2015-12-24 13:24:44	Porkepik	Well, not much against her
2015-12-24 13:24:58	Porkepik	It's just i don't know, her look or her way to be when she is acting
2015-12-24 13:26:10	RyanSmallwood	I
2015-12-24 13:26:23	RyanSmallwood	I've mostly seen her on John Green's youtube videos from when he was on the set of paper towns
2015-12-24 13:26:32	RyanSmallwood	they seemed to be having fun on that set
2015-12-24 13:27:15	Porkepik	Yeah, will need to watch the movie to be sure
2015-12-24 13:27:53	RyanSmallwood	I'm mostly into the Green brother's educational videos on youtube though
2015-12-24 13:27:55	Porkepik	But i don't like the whole "very pretty playful girl" who is always wearing hoodies and seem to like eating pizza and chilling
2015-12-24 13:28:42	Porkepik	Tho i'm sure somehow delevingne is the right cast since she kinda seem to be like that IRL
2015-12-24 13:29:26	RyanSmallwood	well the story is also about how the way people act gives your a shallow understanding of who they actually are
2015-12-24 13:29:48	Porkepik	Isn't like saying that the way people live is how they are ?
2015-12-24 13:29:56	RyanSmallwood	almost a response to the manic pixie dream girl trope
2015-12-24 13:30:09	Porkepik	I mean, seems quite "general" to me
2015-12-24 13:30:14	Porkepik	not really groundbreaking idea
2015-12-24 13:30:27	Porkepik	Isn't there a tons of video talking about it ?
2015-12-24 13:30:31	Porkepik	movies*
2015-12-24 13:30:39	RyanSmallwood	possibly, but maybe not so well
2015-12-24 13:30:44	Porkepik	just asking cause i'm trying to understand the idea
2015-12-24 13:31:14	RyanSmallwood	well to me movies are more about examples than the novelty of ideas
2015-12-24 13:31:24	RyanSmallwood	its not a new idea, but I dunno if its been told that specific way
2015-12-24 13:31:40	RyanSmallwood	and the book/movie is elaborating on a specific example
2015-12-24 13:32:01	Porkepik	the example of teenagers going on a road trip ?
2015-12-24 13:32:04	RyanSmallwood	you can simplify it to the phrase John Green always says "imagine people complexly", but the point of making it into a story is to flesh the idea out
2015-12-24 13:32:27	RyanSmallwood	well I could explain more, but that would amount to me summarizing the story
2015-12-24 13:32:40	RyanSmallwood	the trailers and stuff more resemble the movies that its actually critiquing
2015-12-24 13:32:46	RyanSmallwood	so they might give you an inaccurate image
2015-12-24 13:33:01	Porkepik	Ok, but now why is he focusing on youth ?
2015-12-24 13:33:11	Porkepik	Not really a bad thing tho, just wondering if there is a reason
2015-12-24 13:33:28	RyanSmallwood	He thinks young people feel things more intensely and thats when you  have lots of your formative experiences
2015-12-24 13:33:43	Porkepik	L;
2015-12-24 13:33:44	Porkepik	Ok*
2015-12-24 13:33:58	@indeedwatson	maybe he watches a lot of anim
2015-12-24 13:33:59	@indeedwatson	e
2015-12-24 13:34:08	Porkepik	Let me guess, at the end he doesn't find her but he has had tons of cool experience with his friends ? :D
2015-12-24 13:34:22	Porkepik	No gonna watch it to figure out
2015-12-24 13:34:30	RyanSmallwood	that's an aspect of it, but that's not the main aspect
2015-12-24 13:34:53	@indeedwatson	there's a spoiler meme that came out of one of those movies
2015-12-24 13:34:57	@indeedwatson	something about a grenade
2015-12-24 13:35:08	RyanSmallwood	from TFiOS
2015-12-24 13:35:21	»	muskrat (uid134615@trivialand/player/muskrat) has joined ##truefilm
2015-12-24 13:35:42	@indeedwatson	the mix with breaking bad was pretty funny
2015-12-24 13:35:47	@indeedwatson	hello muskrat 
2015-12-24 13:35:50	Porkepik	The thing is that his books seem interesting. My mother read The Fault in our stars and like it. But is it worth adapting them in movies ?
2015-12-24 13:36:01	muskrat	hey, indeedwatson :)
2015-12-24 13:36:16	RyanSmallwood	well the movies is just making it more available in different media
2015-12-24 13:36:28	RyanSmallwood	I've read TFiOS and Paper Towns and thought they were good books
2015-12-24 13:36:50	Porkepik	Yeah true
2015-12-24 13:36:56	RyanSmallwood	I only watched the TFiOS movie, and thought it was an acceptable adaptation, but didn't have anything new over the book
2015-12-24 13:37:16	RyanSmallwood	except that it made John Green rich so now he can do more awesome projects
2015-12-24 13:37:21	Porkepik	Yeah, i wasn't too much into it but it was interesting i must say
2015-12-24 13:37:34	Porkepik	I remember watching it and expecting a twilight
2015-12-24 13:38:19	Porkepik	But the whole thing in Amsterdam with the writer didn't keep me in it
2015-12-24 13:38:36	Porkepik	Also at some point there is a french waiter
2015-12-24 13:38:39	RyanSmallwood	I haven't read or seen twilight, its definitely aiming at a similar audience, though John Green may have better themes
2015-12-24 13:38:43	Porkepik	And his accent and way to act triggered me :D
2015-12-24 13:38:52	RyanSmallwood	hahahahaha
2015-12-24 13:39:22	Porkepik	Well not gonna judge the themes of it, the books are pretty shit (yep i read them somehow)
2015-12-24 13:39:39	Porkepik	And the movie only watched the first one and it's not really good either
2015-12-24 13:39:53	Porkepik	Like the writing is just classic and quite boring
2015-12-24 13:40:10	RyanSmallwood	I don't have any personal interest in the books or movies, but I find the lashback against them annoying
2015-12-24 13:40:15	Porkepik	Also she doesn't know how to describe a scene. She relies so much on the characters
2015-12-24 13:40:24	RyanSmallwood	there's tons of dumb media for young boys that people just ignore
2015-12-24 13:40:37	RyanSmallwood	I dunno why everyone gets out the pitchforks for dumb  media aimed at young girls
2015-12-24 13:40:54	@indeedwatson	probably cause of the money it makes
2015-12-24 13:41:18	Porkepik	People always want to shit on something
2015-12-24 13:41:25	RyanSmallwood	isn't there plenty of other dumb stuff that makes money though that doesn't have such visceral responses?
2015-12-24 13:41:27	Porkepik	Twilight, Justin Biever, 1D
2015-12-24 13:41:32	lotsoftuna	Paper Towns movie was kinda
2015-12-24 13:41:32	lotsoftuna	meh
2015-12-24 13:41:43	lotsoftuna	I watched every twilight movie
2015-12-24 13:41:44	@indeedwatson	i dunno, transformers gets similar treatment
2015-12-24 13:41:44	lotsoftuna	kill me
2015-12-24 13:42:12	Porkepik	I don't hate on those things but you have to admit their quality, which is quite low
2015-12-24 13:42:20	Porkepik	but after reading the books all i can say is the writing isn't good
2015-12-24 13:42:23	Porkepik	then the story whatever
2015-12-24 13:42:31	RyanSmallwood	I mean there's not shortage of negative opinions about transformers, I remember for a while I couldn't ignore twilight because of all the twilight hate on social media, the lashback seemed much louder than the fandom at least in my circles
2015-12-24 13:43:09	@indeedwatson	i see them both referenced often as examples of bad book/movie
2015-12-24 13:44:01	Porkepik	Well, i could use Harry Potter as example of how to do things badly
2015-12-24 13:44:05	Porkepik	Not that it's bad
2015-12-24 13:44:18	Porkepik	But the truth is nothing is really perfect, a lot can be an example in this matter
2015-12-24 13:44:31	@indeedwatson	but hp has some originality at least, even tho i don't like it anymore i still respect it
2015-12-24 13:44:58	Porkepik	Not that original you know, she just knew how to use all that lore quite well
2015-12-24 13:45:10	RyanSmallwood	I like HP for learning languages cause its so widely translated and easily available
2015-12-24 13:45:18	@indeedwatson	twilight seems bad on every side, characters, plot, originality, overall message, delivery
2015-12-24 13:45:37	Porkepik	Dunno, i kinda like the idea in the beginning
2015-12-24 13:45:44	Porkepik	The girl leaving town to get in the rural part of the USA
2015-12-24 13:45:55	Porkepik	first it's like it's fucking boring but then she ends up liking it
2015-12-24 13:45:59	Porkepik	not really a bad message for youth
2015-12-24 13:46:05	RyanSmallwood	I just try to ignore stuff that doesn't interest me, I don't like to bash on other people's fandoms or guilty pleasures
2015-12-24 13:46:07	Porkepik	Then the love story isn't quite worth it for sure
2015-12-24 13:46:24	Porkepik	The vampire thing was quite weird too and not really used really well
2015-12-24 13:47:03	Porkepik	I would say the first book isn't that bad cause it doesn't focus on the story all the time
2015-12-24 13:47:14	Porkepik	Then it's just story story story character development etc ...
2015-12-24 13:47:24	RyanSmallwood	I really liked Only Lovers Left Alive
2015-12-24 13:49:48	Porkepik	I could understand that some people would be annoyed by Twilight tho
2015-12-24 13:50:01	Porkepik	Cause then it kinda overkill the whole "vampire" thing
2015-12-24 13:50:09	Porkepik	vampire dairies etc etc etc ...
2015-12-24 13:51:45	RyanSmallwood	I'm sure some people had legitimate annoyances, just in my circles nothing every made it into my social media except twilight hate, so I was annoyed that the only reason I knew of its existence was people complaining about it
2015-12-24 13:52:06	Porkepik	I kinda like Robert Pattinson
2015-12-24 13:52:19	Porkepik	He tried to get out of the twilight stuff
2015-12-24 13:52:30	RyanSmallwood	I was excited to see him in that Cronenberg movie, but then I never saw it cause I suck :/
2015-12-24 13:52:57	Porkepik	Many people didn't like this one
2015-12-24 13:53:01	Porkepik	i want to see The Rover
2015-12-24 13:53:33	Porkepik	Honestly i'm sure he can prove something with his acting, i'm more reserved on Kristen Stewart
2015-12-24 13:54:00	@indeedwatson	there's another similarity with transformers
2015-12-24 13:54:51	RyanSmallwood	I need to see   Clouds of Sils Maria
2015-12-24 13:55:34	Card74	It's quite good
2015-12-24 13:55:40	Porkepik	he got good reviews in France
2015-12-24 13:55:49	Porkepik	People really liked it, so yeah i'm interested too
2015-12-24 13:56:01	Porkepik	But it seems special cause IMDB doesn't agree :P
2015-12-24 13:58:24	RyanSmallwood	but IMDB has the best opinions about movies
2015-12-24 13:58:45	Porkepik	Yeah so i'm not gonna watch it. Going back to Nolan filmography as quick as possible :D
2015-12-24 13:59:27	Porkepik	btw Ryan if you may be interested in http://www.critikat.com/
2015-12-24 13:59:46	Porkepik	It's a french critic website but it doesn't focus on the most mainstream stuff
2015-12-24 14:00:18	RyanSmallwood	1. The Shawshank Redemption 2. The Godfather 3. The Godfather: Part II 4. The Dark Knight
2015-12-24 14:00:19	RyanSmallwood	 
2015-12-24 14:00:19	RyanSmallwood	 5. 12 Angry Men 6. Schindler's List 7. Pulp Fiction 8. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly 9. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King 10. Fight Club
2015-12-24 14:00:30	RyanSmallwood	looks like a representative sample of what film history has to offer
2015-12-24 14:00:48	Porkepik	To train your french obviously, not sure if you will find interesting content
2015-12-24 14:01:45	RyanSmallwood	Heh, there's no danger of me not finding enough French media
2015-12-24 14:02:07	Porkepik	Also you may need to look for the french titles of movies :/
2015-12-24 14:02:28	Porkepik	For example "Inside Out" => "Vice Versa" :D
2015-12-24 14:02:43	RyanSmallwood	yeah that happens a lot with movie titles
2015-12-24 14:03:13	RyanSmallwood	Big Drunken Hero => Come Drink With Me

2015-12-24 14:06:32	RyanSmallwood	I probably need more practice with French output, all I do is get input
2015-12-24 14:07:01	Porkepik	output ? Like talking or writing ?
2015-12-24 14:07:16	RyanSmallwood	both
2015-12-24 14:07:34	Porkepik	Ok, for a moment i was thinking like "shitting" french or something :[
2015-12-24 14:08:08	RyanSmallwood	hahaha
2015-12-24 14:08:15	Porkepik	Anyone watched Journey to the Shore ?
2015-12-24 14:08:57	RyanSmallwood	no, Kiyoshi Kurosawa is one of my big blindspots
2015-12-24 14:09:01	Porkepik	Same thing, quite a low rating on IMDB but french critics loved it : http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm-236088/critiques/presse/
2015-12-24 14:09:01		[ http://is.gd/nI0b19 ]
2015-12-24 14:09:43	RyanSmallwood	probably not as good as re-watching Dark Knight again
2015-12-24 14:11:23	Porkepik	and Cemetery of Splendour ?
2015-12-24 14:12:07	Porkepik	would be cool if i could go to Cannes this year
2015-12-24 14:13:16	RyanSmallwood	I thought people can't watch movies in Cannes anymore without being an insider, and its all networking and movie pitches now???
2015-12-24 14:13:40	Porkepik	Pretty much yeah for most releases :/
2015-12-24 14:13:44	Porkepik	That's why it's not really worth much
2015-12-24 14:14:16	RyanSmallwood	I hear Toronto is one of the best film festivals to watch a shit ton of movies
2015-12-24 14:15:50	RyanSmallwood	I'd love to be able to go to Il Cinema Ritrovato in Italy
2015-12-24 14:15:52	Porkepik	In France people see Toronto festival as something more commercial
2015-12-24 14:16:09	Porkepik	Guess they don't really like seeing the Cannes festival loosing popularity i don't know
2015-12-24 14:16:30	Porkepik	But then Cannes is getting more and more commercial anyway
2015-12-24 14:16:55	RyanSmallwood	I mean I think Cannes definitely deserves its status, but most of us lowly common cinephiles only hear about it indirectly, we can go there for a good viewing experience
2015-12-24 14:17:26	RyanSmallwood	*can't go there
2015-12-24 14:18:33	RyanSmallwood	more about the prestige or winning the Palme d'Or and stuff
2015-12-24 14:18:59	RyanSmallwood	how things are receives at Cannes affects how it gets distributed around the world

2015-12-24 16:30:48	AlexJ44	hehe
2015-12-24 16:30:53	AlexJ44	christmas naps are the best
2015-12-24 16:30:57	Suvarna	Did you guys see starwars?
2015-12-24 16:31:02	AlexJ44	I'm looking into downloading a new game for my pc
2015-12-24 16:31:07	AlexJ44	I did suvarna, i've seen you didn't like it much
2015-12-24 16:31:11	Suvarna	me neither
2015-12-24 16:31:11	AlexJ44	RyanSmallwood did a lot, apparently
2015-12-24 16:31:15	Suvarna	alex, which game
2015-12-24 16:31:21	AlexJ44	maybe XCom
2015-12-24 16:31:32	Suvarna	Havent heard of that one
2015-12-24 16:31:54	Suvarna	I don't get time to play GTA5, that game is fun
2015-12-24 16:32:06	AlexJ44	ha i did enjoy it too, but I've played a friend's copy
2015-12-24 16:32:15	Suvarna	cities skylines is pretty great too
2015-12-24 16:32:19	AlexJ44	there's a game ive been eager to play but I need the whole console too
2015-12-24 16:32:47	Suvarna	I did consider getting a ps3 for little big planet, but then its not worth it for just one game
2015-12-24 16:32:59	Suvarna	+ I barely play games
2015-12-24 16:33:09	AlexJ44	ah, that's a very good one
2015-12-24 16:33:11	AlexJ44	specially with friends
2015-12-24 16:33:19	AlexJ44	I have super fond memories of playing the first one with my pals over the internet
2015-12-24 16:35:25	Suvarna	yeah, same. Always had a blast playing that game
2015-12-24 16:35:34	Suvarna	I haven't played any of the sequels
2015-12-24 16:35:47	Suvarna	but the Little Big Planet kart game looks super fun
2015-12-24 16:36:07	AlexJ44	I wanted a vita for Persona 4 Golden
2015-12-24 16:37:44	@indeedwatson	AlexJ44: im downloading xcom rn, what a coincidence
2015-12-24 16:38:21	AlexJ44	are you?
2015-12-24 16:38:27	AlexJ44	pirated?
2015-12-24 16:38:29	@indeedwatson	yes
2015-12-24 16:38:29	@indeedwatson	no
2015-12-24 16:38:35	@indeedwatson	i have it on steam
2015-12-24 16:38:45	AlexJ44	I'm thinking of buying it, but I'll download it first to try it out
2015-12-24 16:38:47	@indeedwatson	i wanted to test the online with a friend
2015-12-24 16:38:53	@indeedwatson	it's good
2015-12-24 16:39:18	@indeedwatson	brb
2015-12-24 16:40:06	AlexJ44	yeah, but I haven't been feeling any videogames lately
2015-12-24 16:40:19	AlexJ44	it's mostly been movies and tv shows, and I honestly miss it
2015-12-24 16:40:23	AlexJ44	I think league of legends spoiled me

2015-12-24 17:06:29	AlexJ44	it has an interesting back story to it
2015-12-24 17:06:48	AlexJ44	supposedly, rossellini was invited by some tourism minister, and they wanted a film to promote modern india
2015-12-24 17:06:55	AlexJ44	he didn't like the idea as much and so made that lol
2015-12-24 17:07:31	Suvarna	Haha, what a massive fuck you. I guess the minister deserved it for trying to commission propaganda
2015-12-24 17:08:56	AlexJ44	but I found it so lovely
2015-12-24 17:09:05	Suvarna	yeah, I enjoyed it too
2015-12-24 17:09:13	AlexJ44	and it's so rossellini
2015-12-24 17:09:17	AlexJ44	in the making process
2015-12-24 17:09:29	AlexJ44	those were not actors, and only some of it is fiction
2015-12-24 17:09:37	Suvarna	It was nice to see the Bombay my grandparents used to live in
2015-12-24 17:09:53	Suvarna	Alex, have you seen 24 city?
2015-12-24 17:11:21	AlexJ44	is it much different now?
2015-12-24 17:11:24	AlexJ44	nope, what is it?
2015-12-24 17:11:47	Suvarna	You won't recognize the place if your only point of reference is matri bhumi
2015-12-24 17:12:02	Suvarna	watch 24city alex, its right down your alley if you liked matri bhumi
2015-12-24 17:12:54	AlexJ44	is it about china?
2015-12-24 17:13:02	Suvarna	yeah
2015-12-24 17:13:30	Suvarna	Jia Zhangke is a great filmmaker if you haven't seen his work
2015-12-24 17:14:20	AlexJ44	nope, i'm not very knowledgeable
2015-12-24 17:14:44	Suvarna	His films often get banned in china
2015-12-24 17:15:05	Suvarna	Watch some of his work, I think you'll like him
2015-12-24 17:15:25	AlexJ44	let me bookmark him
2015-12-24 17:16:27	AlexJ44	i've been bookmarking way more than I've actually watched anything lately lol
2015-12-24 17:17:16	@indeedwatson	AlexJ44: that's how it goes :)
2015-12-24 17:18:03	AlexJ44	indeedwatson , I'm halfway through downloading it

2015-12-24 17:18:25	AlexJ44	hopefully we can play it later! have you heard of starbound? have that too, although a completely different genre
2015-12-24 17:18:34	AlexJ44	Suvarna , what's your thoughts on SW? spoiler free
2015-12-24 17:18:36	Suvarna	same here alex, my watchlist keeps growing and my diary doesnt get updated much
2015-12-24 17:18:40	@indeedwatson	the one that's like terraria in space right?
2015-12-24 17:18:55	@indeedwatson	AlexJ44: did you buy anything this steam sale?
2015-12-24 17:19:16	AlexJ44	yes! It's good, but you need someone to play it with

2015-12-24 17:19:51		[ http://is.gd/fiXI7q ]
2015-12-24 17:19:57	Suvarna	I didn't like it, they played it too safe to satisfy old fans and it lacks any intensity or dramatic buildup for all the important scenes.
2015-12-24 17:20:06	AlexJ44	i haven't bought anything yet, but I might get xcom if I fancy it
2015-12-24 17:20:25	AlexJ44	what's that, muskrat ? (hello!)
2015-12-24 17:20:54	@indeedwatson	i might get frim fandango
2015-12-24 17:20:55	muskrat	oh hey,AlexJ44
2015-12-24 17:20:55	@indeedwatson	grim
2015-12-24 17:20:56	AlexJ44	I felt something like it too, Suvarna , but I'm not even a big SW fan so maybe it works in the franchise context
2015-12-24 17:21:24	muskrat	AlexJ44, it's a natgeo article on the health benefits of immersing yourself in nature
2015-12-24 17:21:32	Suvarna	I used to like starwars when I was younger, so I didn't even enjoy it for the nostalgia value.
2015-12-24 17:22:23	@indeedwatson	Kermode said he didn't feel nostalgia cause he was too late for SW when it came out, but that this one made him "get it"
2015-12-24 17:23:07	AlexJ44	it might have pressed the right keys
2015-12-24 17:23:14	AlexJ44	muskrat , nice article
2015-12-24 17:23:20	muskrat	yw dude
2015-12-24 17:23:23	muskrat	:)
2015-12-24 17:23:34	Suvarna	I stopped listening to Kermode after his review of "the walk"
2015-12-24 17:23:58	@indeedwatson	i wouldn't stop following a critic for one review
2015-12-24 17:24:04	AlexJ44	where are you from, muskrat ?
2015-12-24 17:24:08	Suvarna	Apparently he's a guy who thought it was perfectly reasonable to kiss Phillipe petit's feet when he met him.
2015-12-24 17:24:29	muskrat	AlexJ44, i think you asked me already, but i'm from finland
2015-12-24 17:24:43	muskrat	you're from portugal, right?
2015-12-24 17:24:47	Suvarna	The walk sealed it for me, even before then I wasn't very big on his reviews
2015-12-24 17:25:07	AlexJ44	yes! sorry, i'm not good with managing everyone's home countries :P
2015-12-24 17:25:13	Suvarna	muskrat, is jolla popular in finland?
2015-12-24 17:25:18	muskrat	np
2015-12-24 17:25:24	@indeedwatson	the walk is another film like man on wire?
2015-12-24 17:25:39	muskrat	Suvarna, no idea, tbh
2015-12-24 17:26:20	AlexJ44	yes indeedwatson , but man on wire is a documentary and the walk is fiction so
2015-12-24 17:26:42	Suvarna	I heard 'the walk' was fun to watch in 3d
2015-12-24 17:27:03	Suvarna	I wanted to go see it, but it was out of the cinemas before I could make some time for it
2015-12-24 17:28:02	AlexJ44	we don't really get many good films over here
2015-12-24 17:28:29	AlexJ44	http://cinemas.nos.pt/Cinema.aspx?c=WA that's my local showings

2015-12-24 17:30:43	Suvarna	I was hoping the peanuts movie to be good
2015-12-24 17:30:47	Suvarna	but I didnt like it
2015-12-24 17:31:04	Suvarna	I heard a lot of people liked it

2015-12-24 17:33:01	AlexJ44	"They found that people living near more green space reported less mental distress, even after adjusting for income, education, and employment (all of which are also correlated with health). In 2009 a team of Dutch researchers found a lower incidence of 15 diseases—including depression, anxiety, heart disease, diabetes, asthma, and migraines—in people who lived within about a half mile of green space."

2015-12-24 17:33:35	AlexJ44	"It’s difficult to tell from these kinds of studies why people feel better. Is it the fresh air? Do certain colors or fractal shapes trigger neurochemicals in our visual cortex? Or is it just that people in greener neighborhoods use the parks to exercise more? That’s what Richard Mitchell, an epidemiologist at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, thought at first."

2015-12-24 22:08:54	Mothravka	Is she shoveling sand to live or living to shovel sand?

2015-12-25 00:28:32	@Carson	posted this earlier, tomflint but I thought of a good fan edit project, taking the original star wars films and cutting them into 20 minute segments that resemble 1930 Flash Gordon tv serials
2015-12-25 00:28:38	@Carson	screener season is great
2015-12-25 00:28:40	@Carson	can't keep up
2015-12-25 00:28:44	tomflint	ha
2015-12-25 00:28:57	@Carson	although some screeners are kind of crap though
2015-12-25 00:29:14	tomflint	yeah, Bridge of Spies wasn't very good quality -- they're all SD
2015-12-25 00:29:24	tomflint	CREED was great though
2015-12-25 00:29:38	@Carson	I would love to spend hours and hours on that fan edit project, but I should be doing other things
2015-12-25 00:29:52	@Carson	yeah I've downloaded Creed, waiting to watch it though
2015-12-25 00:29:53	tomflint	I'm watching Hateful 8 in the theatre tomorrow (70mm) -- but so far Creed is the best of the batch
2015-12-25 00:30:32	tomflint	Steve Jobs was ok -- better than it should have been
2015-12-25 00:30:39	@Carson	yeah I saw SJ
2015-12-25 00:30:44	@Carson	it was low SD
2015-12-25 00:30:51	@Carson	but really enjoyed the film
2015-12-25 00:31:09	@Carson	The Revenant screen looks like crap to me
2015-12-25 00:31:25	tomflint	did Hive-CM8 release that one?
2015-12-25 00:32:11	@Carson	not sure
2015-12-25 00:32:27	tomflint	looks like EVO --
2015-12-25 00:32:49	@Carson	just hard to enjoy a pretty movie with the version is crap
2015-12-25 00:32:54	tomflint	no doubt
2015-12-25 00:33:05	@Carson	some films I wouldn't care
2015-12-25 00:33:12	tomflint	I just started Spotlight --
2015-12-25 00:33:29	@Carson	oh I didnt know that screener was out
2015-12-25 00:33:57	@Carson	saw SW in theater because I had to, and saw it with some friends
2015-12-25 00:34:11	tomflint	did you like it?
2015-12-25 00:34:17	@Carson	it was good
2015-12-25 00:34:32	tomflint	I've found a small group that hated it as much as I did

2015-12-25 00:34:58	@Carson	good start for the new SW franchise

2015-12-25 00:35:33	@Carson	yeah each day that passes I think about how much stuff didn't watch

2015-12-25 00:36:38	@Carson	Maz Kanata was a bit disappointing

2015-12-25 00:37:01	@Carson	I read that a lot of her screen time got cut

2015-12-25 00:37:22	@Carson	thought she would be more complex
2015-12-25 00:37:28	@Carson	have more character
2015-12-25 00:37:37	tomflint	oh wait!
2015-12-25 00:37:44	tomflint	ok, so here's the thing ---
2015-12-25 00:37:51	@Carson	but she was an alien fortune teller / oracle
2015-12-25 00:37:52	tomflint	she's all *into* the force, but not in the force
2015-12-25 00:38:12	tomflint	the CGI on her was decent, but too heavy

2015-12-25 00:52:20	tomflint	its cursed
2015-12-25 00:53:25	@Carson	haha my gf likes how Ruffalo looks
2015-12-25 00:53:32	tomflint	haha
2015-12-25 00:53:43	@Carson	think it's for that rugged ugly look though
2015-12-25 00:55:50	@Carson	I actually thought I would like SW a lot more, I think the way they set it up works but I just didn't think the execution of the plot worked very well
2015-12-25 00:56:10	tomflint	too much hype.
2015-12-25 00:56:22	tomflint	I wish they didn't talk about it at all then UNLEASHED it ---
2015-12-25 00:56:25	tomflint	no hype.
2015-12-25 00:57:35	@Carson	yeah...
2015-12-25 00:57:46	tomflint	though, I wish most movies were like that
2015-12-25 00:57:56	tomflint	btw -- Spotlight is great so far
2015-12-25 00:58:00	@Carson	nice
2015-12-25 00:58:02	@Carson	downloading now
2015-12-25 00:58:03	tomflint	well written --- fantastic casting too
2015-12-25 00:58:59	@Carson	I think when I watch act II and III of SW TFA I realized that I watch real adult movies that know how to tell a story and use a camera properly
2015-12-25 00:59:00	@Carson	!
2015-12-25 00:59:45	tomflint	did I ever show you my black and white cut?

2015-12-25 01:00:37	@Carson	I watch Empire Strikes Back Despecialized 2 days before TFA
2015-12-25 01:00:55	tomflint	it'd be nice to make a Star Wars Saga that cuts all of the movies together -- but focused on the Force
2015-12-25 01:01:34	@Carson	hmm
2015-12-25 01:01:35	@indeedwatson	it'd be nice to make a Star Wars Saga that cuts all of the movies together -- but focused on Jar Jar
2015-12-25 01:01:37	@Carson	The Force Cut
2015-12-25 01:01:51	@indeedwatson	like a jar jar spin off
2015-12-25 01:01:51	@Carson	it would be short
2015-12-25 01:01:55	@indeedwatson	a sitcom
2015-12-25 01:01:57	@indeedwatson	with laugh tracks
2015-12-25 01:01:57	tomflint	actually, i you rewatch with an understanding of the Darth Jar Jar theory, the prequels are awesome
2015-12-25 01:01:57	@Carson	true
2015-12-25 01:02:03	@Carson	that would be silly fun
2015-12-25 01:02:09	tomflint	there is a silly cut!
2015-12-25 01:03:20	tomflint	Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Ridiculous Menace

2015-12-25 01:03:33		[ http://is.gd/VFwWvz ]
2015-12-25 01:04:06	@Carson	I've become interested in reading the Star Wars Saga as a troupe-y serialized sci fi, and Lucas said he was inspired by Flash Gordon, but couldn't get the film rights at the time
2015-12-25 01:04:26	tomflint	oh wait! that's not the one
2015-12-25 01:05:49	tomflint	there's one that's all slapstick stuff
2015-12-25 01:05:54	@indeedwatson	i still like to ponder how different it'd be if Dune was made and not SW
2015-12-25 01:06:03	@Carson	every 20 minute episode ends with a clffhanger
2015-12-25 01:08:15	@Carson	I also noticed a line where Jon B, the actor who plays Finn, slips his British accent
2015-12-25 01:08:17	tomflint	actually if you did 45 minutes, it'd work well with the script
2015-12-25 01:08:23	tomflint	haha
2015-12-25 01:08:48	@Carson	it was a scene on the desert planet with Rey on Jakku
2015-12-25 01:09:00	@indeedwatson	it was probably the empire controlling him
2015-12-25 01:09:13	tomflint	it'd be nice to recut the movies to focus on the dark side
2015-12-25 01:09:16	@Carson	I think he got knocked down and landed in a tent or something
2015-12-25 01:09:29	@Carson	46 min seems long for a serial
2015-12-25 01:09:33	@Carson	45*
2015-12-25 01:09:52	tomflint	make a cut and see how it goes --- the fan edit scene would love it
2015-12-25 01:09:57	@Carson	but yeah I've noticed the different acts fit that time
2015-12-25 01:10:37	@Carson	also obviously noticed each act took place a different planet
2015-12-25 01:10:42	tomflint	use Harmy's Despecialized versions for it too --
2015-12-25 01:11:02	@Carson	Jakku desert planet, Forest planet, Starkiller Base- Snow planet
2015-12-25 01:11:19	@Carson	yeah I only watch Harmys know
2015-12-25 01:11:21	@Carson	can't go back
2015-12-25 01:11:39	@Carson	i had no issues watching ESP
2015-12-25 01:11:42	@Carson	ESB*
2015-12-25 01:12:08	tomflint	its so good
2015-12-25 01:12:16	@Carson	i found this connection in research, but no fan sites have mentioned this
2015-12-25 01:12:17	tomflint	this is brilliant. https://i.imgur.com/MZcp3.webm
2015-12-25 01:12:26	tomflint	..?
2015-12-25 01:12:33	tomflint	about the locations?
2015-12-25 01:12:38	@Carson	but Max Von Snoden opens up this SW film in that tent in Jakku
2015-12-25 01:12:57	@Carson	Snoden no
2015-12-25 01:13:24	@Carson	Sydow*
2015-12-25 01:13:38	@Carson	he also opens up the 1980's film Flash Gorden
2015-12-25 01:13:42	@Carson	Gordon*
2015-12-25 01:13:46	tomflint	oh nice!
2015-12-25 01:13:47	@Carson	as the villian
2015-12-25 01:14:45	@Carson	I'm also speculating that he will be delivering the Death Star plans to Princess Leia from the beginning of A New Hope
2015-12-25 01:15:08	@Carson	which will end next years Rouge One Star Wars film
2015-12-25 01:15:20	tomflint	oh nice
2015-12-25 01:15:30	@Carson	but have Ben Mindleson play a young Max Von Sydow
2015-12-25 01:15:34	@Carson	but just a guess
2015-12-25 01:15:40	tomflint	that would be killer

2015-12-25 01:16:12	tomflint	honestly, I can't imagine Luke having any sort of important role outside of training
2015-12-25 01:16:13	@Carson	so that he is the literal usher of both Star Wars trilogies
2015-12-25 01:16:33	@Carson	yeah not sure what they will do
2015-12-25 01:16:42	@Carson	don't want to say to much because of spoilers
2015-12-25 01:17:16	tomflint	ha. if anyone hasn't seen it by now, they shouldn't care
2015-12-25 01:17:21	@Carson	that's true
2015-12-25 01:17:24	tomflint	shit, even my sister has watched it
2015-12-25 01:17:57	@Carson	I imagine the spoiler buffer will go away when the new year begins
2015-12-25 01:18:46	@Carson	there are 2 major spoilers, one you learn early on and then big character moment at the end
2015-12-25 01:19:13	tomflint	for me, I went in assuming everything that was revealed
2015-12-25 01:19:14	@Carson	and the last scene of the film was really predictable
2015-12-25 01:20:37	tomflint	Billy Crudup is one of those actors who can change his looks with ease
2015-12-25 01:20:40	@Carson	seems like they are setting up the next film as a training session for each side of the force
2015-12-25 01:20:49	tomflint	yeah
2015-12-25 01:21:17	tomflint	if it ends up that the girl is Luke's daughter and ends up in a fight against Kylo Ren -- I'm leaving the theatre :)
2015-12-25 01:21:32	@Carson	well that what it looks like
2015-12-25 01:21:41	tomflint	the. worst.
2015-12-25 01:21:54	@Carson	that's*, but who knows what direction they will go
2015-12-25 01:22:00	tomflint	so instead of training up new Jedi, Luke has been banging chicks around the galaxy ----
2015-12-25 01:22:20	@Carson	I had speculated on their heritage but I had their parents flipped
2015-12-25 01:22:50	@Carson	well I have a half-baked theory
2015-12-25 01:23:32	@indeedwatson	i have tickets for jan 1st
2015-12-25 01:23:48	@Carson	have you seen it yet?
2015-12-25 01:23:49	tomflint	my guess is that Kylo wanted a father figure, but has too much of Han's rebel spirit in him to dedicate to the discipline the Jedi require
2015-12-25 01:23:59	@Carson	spoilers all
2015-12-25 01:24:00	@Carson	lol

2015-12-25 01:25:07	@Carson	and there were lines in the hallways
2015-12-25 01:26:09	@Carson	my half-baked theory is that Felicity Jones character in Rouge One is Reys mother
2015-12-25 01:26:43	@Carson	she seems like the main character in Rouge One
2015-12-25 01:27:11	@Carson	but I'm jut getting really tired of this who are your parents shit
2015-12-25 01:27:29	@Carson	i understand Luke I am your father shocked some people
2015-12-25 01:28:17	tomflint	movies had less twists back then though
2015-12-25 01:28:27	tomflint	they also didn't rush into it ---
2015-12-25 01:28:35	@Carson	but let's not make every main character have mysterious origins
2015-12-25 01:28:37	tomflint	we saw Vader's actual power and authority ---

2015-12-26 10:23:32	tomflint	Suvarna: the sad thing is that most of these theatres don't have anyone who know what they're doing with that type of hardware
2015-12-26 10:26:58	Suvarna	That's what happens when the industry is forced to adapt to new tech, even when older tech is clearly superior. The projectionists were forced into retirement or towards other industries. Now there is a shortage of skilled projectionists.
2015-12-26 10:32:10	tomflint	I remember when the projectionists were being let go in my area. It was around the time of Sixth Sense. When they were picketing, they all had signs saying 'BRUCE WILLIS IS DEAD'
2015-12-26 10:32:38	tomflint	the last time I was in the back of a theatre, there was a teenager running about 6 theatres alone

2015-12-26 14:17:56	Porkepik	But on a rewatch, i could like it. I couldn't stand the guy and because of that i didn't understand how she could fell in love with him :/
2015-12-26 14:18:06	Porkepik	La Notte on the other hand was wonderful
2015-12-26 14:18:27	Porkepik	But i kinda prefer the visuals of l'avventura over la notte
2015-12-26 14:18:49	Porkepik	But in La Notte, they're boring on a purpose to me
2015-12-26 14:18:59	Porkepik	So in a way, they had more effects on me

2015-12-28 21:36:06	RyanSmallwood	now there's no rating, so I have no way of knowing what Porkepik thinks about  Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors
2015-12-28 21:37:07	Porkepik	Damn ... He went from reviewing to rating to expressing nothing
2015-12-28 21:37:41	Porkepik	I really liked it, sadly i watched it in a pity quality and it was hard to enjoy the camera work as much as i should have
2015-12-28 21:38:30	RyanSmallwood	glad to hear you liked it, sorry about the quality
2015-12-28 21:38:53	RyanSmallwood	that's my favorite Parajanov film
2015-12-28 21:39:33	Porkepik	It's hard to recreate an atmosphere of an old time
2015-12-28 21:39:50	Porkepik	And he did it without it feeling old in every way
2015-12-28 21:40:06	Porkepik	The cinematography was quite modern
2015-12-28 21:40:41	RyanSmallwood	yeah, his cinematography severely shifts to very static and flat
2015-12-28 21:41:09	RyanSmallwood	cause one of his friends told him Shadows of the Forgotten Ancestors was only good because of its cinematography, so he wanted to prove he was a good filmmaker without fancy camera movements
2015-12-28 21:41:39	Porkepik	There is a shot i love, the one where he finds her body and suddenly the camera man run towards him after a quick static shot
2015-12-28 21:41:48	Porkepik	Like something is coming at him
2015-12-28 21:42:38	RyanSmallwood	its probably harder for us to appreciate but it was also widely praised for its sound design
2015-12-28 21:43:03	RyanSmallwood	Ukranian films were usually dubbed into Russian, but this one played throughout the Soviet Union in its original Ukranian language track
2015-12-28 21:44:24	Porkepik	It was quite sad and depressing tho
2015-12-28 21:44:50	@indeedwatson	wat
2015-12-28 21:44:51	RyanSmallwood	yeah
2015-12-28 21:44:58	@indeedwatson	nolan is making a WWII movie?
2015-12-28 21:45:14	Porkepik	His life going from adventurous and romantic to loneliness and boredom
2015-12-28 21:45:20	@indeedwatson	Following in the footsteps of Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick, Christopher Nolan is prepping an epic war movie titled “Dunkirk”
2015-12-28 21:45:21	@indeedwatson	ahahah
2015-12-28 21:46:09	RyanSmallwood	will be curious to see him do something more straighforward
2015-12-28 21:46:12	Card74	next thing you know, it will be a trilogy
2015-12-28 21:46:30	Card74	because everything has to be a trilogy
2015-12-28 21:47:34	@indeedwatson	well lets give him credit for making original stand alone films

2015-12-28 21:47:50	Porkepik	So Ryan will never know what i think !
2015-12-28 21:47:51	@indeedwatson	The large scale film will be shot on a combination of IMAX 65mm and 65mm large-format film photography for maximum image quality and high impact immersion. 
2015-12-28 21:47:54	@indeedwatson	that's nice
2015-12-28 21:48:06	@indeedwatson	no Porkepik be a man a show your ratings to the world
2015-12-28 21:48:15	@indeedwatson	even if you disagree with your own ratings 1 week after like me
2015-12-28 21:48:23	Porkepik	I'm a coward, it's in my blood
2015-12-28 21:48:31	Porkepik	White flag, i gave up :(
2015-12-28 21:49:19	Porkepik	I want to rewatch Persona :X
2015-12-28 21:49:53	RyanSmallwood	just keep re-watching Persona
2015-12-28 21:49:55	@indeedwatson	Porkepik: im just gonna assume every film you watch without rating was so bad it was below 1 star :)
2015-12-28 21:50:06	Porkepik	Yeah, fuck the list and fuck everything. Every day is Persona day
2015-12-28 21:50:37	Porkepik	Thinking of watching A Report on the Party and Guests now

2015-12-29 22:28:07	@indeedwatson	muskrat: just curious if it was worth rewatching
2015-12-29 22:36:47	Card74	I haven't bothered... it's a one-trick pony in my opinion. Knowing the ending reduces the suspense. Good performances, though.
2015-12-29 22:39:50	RyanSmallwood	Porkepik: thoughts on A Story Written with Water?
2015-12-29 22:39:58	Porkepik	Really loved it !
2015-12-29 22:40:03	RyanSmallwood	:D
2015-12-29 22:40:13	Porkepik	Tho ... And i'm trying to not think to much of it cause it's not like it bothered me
2015-12-29 22:40:17	Porkepik	but the acting isn't incredible
2015-12-29 22:40:40	@indeedwatson	acting should be credible :D
2015-12-29 22:41:01	Card74	:p
2015-12-29 22:41:13	Porkepik	yeah, well, it was okay but the reactions weren't always very "credible" as you said
2015-12-29 22:41:26	Porkepik	It was really "resting" to watch also
2015-12-29 22:41:37	Porkepik	except some intense scene of confrontations
2015-12-29 22:41:47	Porkepik	But i love that japan
2015-12-29 22:42:04	Porkepik	Everything they wear seem to comfortable :X
2015-12-29 22:42:32	Porkepik	But i feel like Yoshida is really that underrated filmmakers
2015-12-29 22:42:45	Porkepik	Really want to watch the rest of his filmography to have an idea on it
2015-12-29 22:42:55	Porkepik	But i'm surprised to see it's so unknown
2015-12-29 22:43:14	Porkepik	Even his most famous movie is barely watched "Eros + Massacre"
2015-12-29 22:43:39	@indeedwatson	i watched that the other day
2015-12-29 22:43:43	@indeedwatson	hadn't seen any yoshida
2015-12-29 22:43:45	RyanSmallwood	yeah, Japanese cinema in general gets neglected a lot if you don't make Samurai movies
2015-12-29 22:44:50	RyanSmallwood	but Yoshida probably moreso than most, though that's changing more recently
2015-12-29 22:45:08	Porkepik	He is still alive with his wife
2015-12-29 22:45:20	Porkepik	Who play in most of his movies
2015-12-29 22:45:27	Porkepik	(naked)
2015-12-29 22:45:32	Porkepik	(i think that's his fetish)

2015-12-29 22:55:31	RyanSmallwood	I've seen 3 Yoshida films
2015-12-29 22:56:08	@indeedwatson	i was asking Porkepik 
2015-12-29 22:56:13	@indeedwatson	which one is your favorite tho
2015-12-29 22:56:17	@indeedwatson	of the ones you've seen
2015-12-29 22:56:33	RyanSmallwood	Porkepik: just saw his first I think
2015-12-29 22:57:06	RyanSmallwood	A Story Written With Water is my favorite so far, Eros + Massacre may be the greater overall film, but I feel like I was missing some historical context to fully appreciate it
2015-12-29 22:57:48	@indeedwatson	yeah
2015-12-29 23:00:28	Porkepikk	Btw Ryan, go look my letterboxd page
2015-12-29 23:02:25	RyanSmallwood	what about it?
2015-12-29 23:02:38	Porkepikk	Got rid of the ratingd
2015-12-29 23:03:23	RyanSmallwood	I still see some ratings
2015-12-29 23:03:31	Porkepikk	What ?
2015-12-29 23:03:36	RyanSmallwood	you like Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire better than The Fault in Our Stars
2015-12-29 23:03:51	Porkepikk	Nornally i got rid of them all
2015-12-29 23:04:04	RyanSmallwood	maybe its still in the activity page...
2015-12-29 23:04:07	Porkepikk	Or then you re looking at the activity feed
2015-12-29 23:04:23	Porkepikk	Oh yeah but don t worry it s gonna disappear after a month
2015-12-29 23:04:37	RyanSmallwood	ahhh, found the ratings page, empty!
2015-12-29 23:04:50	Porkepikk	Or so ... anyway Goblet of fire it s cause i really liked that one when i was a kid
2015-12-29 23:05:17	Porkepikk	It was dark and i thought it was a good introduction to voldemort, which wad quite hyped
2015-12-29 23:05:34	RyanSmallwood	yeesh, now I have to talk to you to figure out what films you like, instead of using technology to efficiently see your affection for a film as a number value

2015-12-30 00:01:08	@indeedwatson	i'd have to go downtown

2015-12-30 09:53:29	tomflint	where are you from?
2015-12-30 09:53:48	daisdicedice	Malaysia~
2015-12-30 09:54:20	tomflint	nice. So Netflix works but you have no way to pay for it?
2015-12-30 09:55:39	daisdicedice	yeap that's pretty much it. it'd say that it would only accept US payment. tough game
2015-12-30 09:56:53	daisdicedice	if someone lent me their account, in return i'd be willing to give access to my Mubi account haha
2015-12-30 09:57:25	tomflint	I like Mubi
2015-12-30 09:57:42	tomflint	Their interface needs some work -- but their selection is great
2015-12-30 09:59:32	daisdicedice	me too! i'm alright with their interface tho
2015-12-30 10:00:09	daisdicedice	plus VPNs work with it, so you can switch countries anytime and get more movies that way
2015-12-30 10:01:39	daisdicedice	currently i think the UK one has the best selection in terms of acclaimed movies: Babel, The Red Shoes, All That Jazz, Tokyo Godfathers, My Winnipeg, La Chinoise just to name a few~

2015-12-30 10:54:33	@indeedwatson	why do you need a vpn
2015-12-30 10:57:57	Porkepikk	Cause i don't want to pay a fine
2015-12-30 10:59:15	daisdicedice	it's not that easy to get a fine is it?
2015-12-30 10:59:33	@indeedwatson	silly europe
2015-12-30 10:59:41	Porkepikk	Yeah but still prefer to be careful
2015-12-30 11:00:01	daisdicedice	i see
2015-12-30 11:00:14	Porkepikk	First you get a warning
2015-12-30 11:00:31	Porkepikk	I think you get 2 letters before the fine
2015-12-30 11:00:51	Porkepikk	But i don't even want to get it for now
2015-12-30 11:02:12	daisdicedice	i don't think it's a problem that significant tho
2015-12-30 11:02:32	Porkepikk	What ?
2015-12-30 11:02:41	Porkepikk	Getting warnings then possibly a fine ?
2015-12-30 11:03:29	daisdicedice	significant as in, it'd be rare to get a fine
2015-12-30 11:03:47	Porkepikk	I kinda want to keep the few money i have, a lot of people do that as a security and safety. A VPN doesn t cost a lot and it's really useful
2015-12-30 11:05:10	daisdicedice	i understand haha. but ya it's just my understanding is that so many people are already pirating that it'd be totally strange to just send a warning to one person
2015-12-30 11:05:43	Porkepikk	Well, they are sending warnings
2015-12-30 11:06:00	daisdicedice	true
2015-12-30 11:06:00	Porkepikk	A few millions already, tho the system is complete shit
2015-12-30 11:06:11	Porkepikk	We already spent millions of euros on that shiy
2015-12-30 11:06:25	Porkepikk	And i don't even know if someone was fined
2015-12-30 11:06:38	Porkepikk	So they kinda want to get to the new step
2015-12-30 11:07:01	Porkepikk	Politicians want money and support, so why not ask those big movie companies ?
2015-12-30 11:07:50	daisdicedice	that's true. it's always the money :/
2015-12-30 11:07:59	Porkepikk	Anyway, piracy laws are getting worse and cause of that i'm turning into a socialist-anarchist-terrorist
2015-12-30 11:08:40	Porkepikk	LIBERTY FRATERNITY EQUALITY !!!!!! REVOLUTION !!!!!!!!!
2015-12-30 11:09:25	daisdicedice	!!! hahaha
2015-12-30 11:09:54	Porkepikk	But yeah, i'm probably over-reacting for being worry about torrenting a Godard movie during a night
2015-12-30 11:09:54	daisdicedice	what Godard are you torrenting btw?
2015-12-30 11:10:28	Porkepikk	2 or 3 things to know about her or whatever the english titles actually is
2015-12-30 11:12:50	daisdicedice	oh i have that downloaded too lol
2015-12-30 11:13:46	Porkepikk	I'm possibly gonna turn into a Godard fangay so i have a reason to meet him IRL
2015-12-30 11:14:16	Porkepikk	He is quite old, so i wanna try before i regret it but this guy is almost never out
2015-12-30 11:14:34	Porkepikk	Doesn't talk to the press much unless he has a new film
2015-12-30 11:14:59	Porkepikk	I could try with Jodorowsky
2015-12-30 11:15:44	Porkepikk	And i don't know if there is any festival in France other than Cannes they might go

2015-12-30 11:17:17	daisdicedice	you should definitely go meet them considering their age
2015-12-30 11:17:40	daisdicedice	Jodorowsky has Endless Poetry out next year so you might have a chance!
2015-12-30 11:17:48	Porkepikk	Anyway, i gave up already. I'm gonna turn back into a Nolan-Tarantino fangay like the rest of the population
2015-12-30 11:19:56	daisdicedice	who are your favourite personalities besides them?

2015-12-30 21:22:04	@indeedwatson	almost done, ep 14
2015-12-30 21:22:13	@indeedwatson	he's talking about lotsoftuna favorite film
2015-12-30 21:22:21	RyanSmallwood	which film is that?
2015-12-30 21:23:07	@indeedwatson	i think it's romeo + juliet
2015-12-30 21:23:23	RyanSmallwood	ohhh I remember
2015-12-30 21:23:40	RyanSmallwood	I didn't think the end of Story of Film was as good as the rest...
2015-12-30 21:24:17	RyanSmallwood	though its always hard to say what modern films are most important without any hindsight
2015-12-30 21:24:24	@indeedwatson	yeah
2015-12-30 21:25:42	@indeedwatson	but i like how he evaluates modern films by drawing parallels and showing quotes from older films
2015-12-30 21:28:34	RyanSmallwood	ahhh I don't remember that part as much
2015-12-30 21:29:42	@indeedwatson	he showed for example two hitmen in a noir film going to kill someone and then in pulp fiction the same setting, but filled with mundane dialogue
2015-12-30 21:34:25	RyanSmallwood	ahh, is that just cause tarantino likes referencing/updating old movie tropes though?
2015-12-30 21:35:13	@indeedwatson	his point was that that's what postmodernism and the 90s were about
2015-12-30 21:36:00	RyanSmallwood	gotya
2015-12-30 21:36:45	@indeedwatson	he also showed some indian films where a director made a movie, and then years later went back to the same place and made a movie about what was happening around when they were making the movie

2015-12-30 22:31:15	@Carson	yeah the one where she has to help Cage with a case
2015-12-30 22:32:11	RyanSmallwood	ah yeah, I remember that was less interesting
2015-12-30 22:33:47	@Carson	saw Spectre last night
2015-12-30 22:34:00	@indeedwatson	what did u think
2015-12-30 22:34:49	Porkepik	NOOOOOOO
2015-12-30 22:34:57	@Carson	it was good, not great, but doesn't really seem that significant
2015-12-30 22:34:58	@Carson	not sure why
2015-12-30 22:34:59	Porkepik	My rip of Weekend is hard subbed
2015-12-30 22:35:29	@indeedwatson	rip the rip
2015-12-30 22:35:47	RyanSmallwood	a lot of people said it was terrible, I thought it did some things right, but agree it wasn't amazing
2015-12-30 22:36:03	@Carson	I mean it's Bond, so it's not the greatest franchise but something was a bit off about the film
2015-12-30 22:36:04	RyanSmallwood	Porkepik: just use it to learn some more english
2015-12-30 22:36:15	@Carson	it had everything that would make a great Bond film
2015-12-30 22:36:19	@Carson	but didn't feel like one
2015-12-30 22:36:22	RyanSmallwood	Mission Impossible was way better this year
2015-12-30 22:37:17	@indeedwatson	i never liked either of those franchises
2015-12-30 22:37:35	@Carson	same, but i've seen all the films
2015-12-30 22:37:51	@Carson	as a student of film, thought it might be important to look into
2015-12-30 22:38:08	@Carson	mainly to have a conversation about franchises
2015-12-30 22:38:14	@Carson	which I don't normally enjoy
2015-12-30 22:38:39	RyanSmallwood	I dunno about the previous Mission Impossible films, but the newest one was genuinely a really fun and very well made action film
2015-12-30 22:39:18	@Carson	MI started getting better starting with MI III
2015-12-30 22:39:26	@indeedwatson	Carson: you watched all the JB films?
2015-12-30 22:40:00	@Carson	but MI 4 is definitely a turning point
2015-12-30 22:40:41	@Carson	yeah I watched them all last year in order, with multiple day breaks watching other films of course
2015-12-30 22:40:49	@indeedwatson	damn
2015-12-30 22:40:56	@indeedwatson	i watched... one, or two at most
2015-12-30 22:41:47	@Carson	yeah it's not my proudest moment
2015-12-30 22:42:01	@indeedwatson	haha
2015-12-30 22:42:05	RyanSmallwood	I want to watch them all after reading the Film Crit Hulk article
2015-12-30 22:42:17	RyanSmallwood	he doesn't like a lot of the really popular ones
2015-12-30 22:42:27	@indeedwatson	i don't think any article in the world could make me do that
2015-12-30 22:43:53	RyanSmallwood	they're big cultural reference points, I'll have to watch them all eventually
2015-12-30 22:45:30	@indeedwatson	meh i wouldn't watch movies just cause of that unless they're good in themselves
2015-12-30 22:45:41	@indeedwatson	certainly not 40 movies
2015-12-30 22:47:08	@Carson	more like 25
2015-12-30 22:47:41	@indeedwatson	but u could watch paul blart 25 times instead
2015-12-30 22:48:59	RyanSmallwood	spent a chapter reading about Hegel's idea of "pure being" and "nothing", another chapter reading about becoming, and a

2015-12-30 23:18:09	RyanSmallwood	so is Deadpool going to actually be funny, or is it just going to be all "teehee, we're cursing in a marvel superhero movie" ???
2015-12-30 23:19:08	@indeedwatson	imo the marvel movies have some witty lines
2015-12-30 23:24:30	Porkepik	Do you know how much a normal marvel movie is already making self-awareness jokes ?
2015-12-30 23:24:39	Porkepik	In Deadpool this is one of the foundation
2015-12-30 23:24:58	Porkepik	So they will either have somehow magically well balanced it
2015-12-30 23:25:09	Porkepik	Or it's gonna be a disaster and after 20 minutes you will want to leave the theater
2015-12-30 23:25:32	@indeedwatson	i think it's just gonna be an alright marvel movie
2015-12-30 23:25:45	@indeedwatson	im more interested in that than in captain america
2015-12-30 23:26:03	Porkepik	Also this movie may be cursed by "hip hop in background when character is making illegal stuff cause you know he is so thug life"
2015-12-30 23:26:07	@indeedwatson	and the last one got good reviews

2015-12-30 23:37:52	RyanSmallwood	*part of the movie
2015-12-30 23:39:08	@indeedwatson	ive no idea
2015-12-30 23:40:05	Porkepik	Well Deadpool the video game was quite fun yeah
2015-12-30 23:40:15	@indeedwatson	i feel bad for the secondary characters in JJ
2015-12-30 23:40:19	Porkepik	Marvel can go wild sometimes, but i'm not sure about that when it comes to movies
2015-12-30 23:40:50	RyanSmallwood	yeah JJ puts its characters through the ringer

2015-12-30 23:42:33	RyanSmallwood	I kind of wonder if a rated R superhero movie will do well, at least here in the states where we're puritanical, seems like sex and violence doesn't do well in movie theaters as much, people prefer  to watch that stuff alone at home
2015-12-30 23:42:59	Porkepik	Also popular mainstream shows contains quite a lot of shocking content (Breaking Bad, GoT)
2015-12-30 23:43:13	Porkepik	It's the opposite of mainstream movies i feel
2015-12-30 23:43:29	Porkepik	I think the audience that watch tv shows are younger
2015-12-30 23:43:39	Porkepik	and they're more okay with drugs, violence and sex
2015-12-30 23:43:43	@indeedwatson	im not sure

2015-12-30 23:46:10	Porkepik	Idk, i don't understand what you're talking about
2015-12-30 23:46:28	Porkepik	people watched blockbusters to fap ?

2015-12-30 23:46:29	@indeedwatson	that documentary about MPAA's ratings is very interesting

2015-12-30 23:46:36	RyanSmallwood	I guess MPAAA is weird
2015-12-30 23:46:52	RyanSmallwood	but like alot of big 80s action movies had more sex and violence
2015-12-30 23:47:03	Porkepik	What about MPAAAA ?
2015-12-30 23:47:04	RyanSmallwood	now it seems where you can watch more of that content online

2015-12-30 23:49:39	Porkepik	The big one, that care about their ratings
2015-12-30 23:50:39	@indeedwatson	well if you make a small film and you want to show something that will get you an adult rating you might get lose the funding 
2015-12-30 23:50:55	@indeedwatson	i wouldn't consider american psycho a big movie
2015-12-30 23:51:02	Porkepik	Well, go look for french producers, like Lynch had to do :D
2015-12-30 23:51:12	Porkepik	Like so many filmmakers who actually go to europe for that :/
2015-12-30 23:51:23	Porkepik	But yeah i get it's annoying

2015-12-31 18:31:36	RyanSmallwood	I can understand its a problem a lot of women deal with way too often, and it kind of gets overused as a lazy narrative device sometimes
2015-12-31 18:32:02	RyanSmallwood	its tricky how to deal with it properly in media, and different women have different views on it
2015-12-31 18:33:11	@indeedwatson	maybe it sounds mean but to me that's not as important as artistic freedom

2015-12-31 18:35:21	RyanSmallwood	well a lot of feminists are necessarily in favor of censorship, they're just making it clear they won't support media that uses rape inappropriately
2015-12-31 18:36:52	@indeedwatson	you mean aren't?
2015-12-31 18:37:05	RyanSmallwood	yeah *aren't
2015-12-31 18:38:06	@indeedwatson	but when you have to define what's appropriate, that's where it gets tricky
2015-12-31 18:40:09	RyanSmallwood	I think artists just need to be aware that its a problem that is very common for women to face, and if they put that kind of content into their art they risk alienating a lot of their audience if they are careless about it
2015-12-31 18:41:20	@indeedwatson	well i also disagree with purposely appealing to a mass audience

2015-12-31 18:48:08	Porkepik	"in my end"
2015-12-31 18:49:55	RyanSmallwood	indeedwatson: I think all art has to appeal to somebody, and I don't think being responsible about the portrayal of rape puts too many chains around the expressions of artists, its not like there's some great artistic need to flippantly bring up rape without knowing much about how it potentially effects an audience
2015-12-31 18:50:28	@indeedwatson	appeal to somebody is not the same as appeal to everybody
2015-12-31 18:50:32	Porkepik	If it appeal to the artist
2015-12-31 18:51:25	@indeedwatson	but artists aren't usually asked to be responsible about the portrayal of violence and other things
2015-12-31 18:51:47	Porkepik	Wait ... What about the MPAA ?
2015-12-31 18:52:02	Porkepik	That's a good example of an organization asking artists to be "responsible" about a lot of themes
2015-12-31 18:52:06	Porkepik	including violence and sex
2015-12-31 18:52:12	@indeedwatson	that's more like a mafia
2015-12-31 18:52:16	RyanSmallwood	censoring is not the same as being responsible
2015-12-31 18:52:34	Porkepik	Then who asked artsits to be responsible ?
2015-12-31 18:52:36	Porkepik	Their mother ?
2015-12-31 18:53:05	RyanSmallwood	Its just the discussion that goes back and forth between audience and artists
2015-12-31 18:53:13	Porkepik	Oh yeah i see
2015-12-31 18:53:45	RyanSmallwood	like I think most feminists would be fine with rape porn for a select audience that's has rape fantasies, if that's the target of the media
2015-12-31 18:54:15	RyanSmallwood	its just when it gets brought up in media that isn't improved by the inclusion of it, they're voicing their opinion that they won't personally support that media
2015-12-31 18:54:27	RyanSmallwood	which isn't to condemn that media from everyone but just to be part of the cultural debate
2015-12-31 18:54:36	Porkepik	Examples ? Cause i'm kinda lost and don't know much about it
2015-12-31 18:55:17	RyanSmallwood	can't think of a specific one, but like in lots of generic action movies a lot of times there's a woman who's about to be raped and the hero saves her
2015-12-31 18:55:31	@indeedwatson	but that's just lazy writing
2015-12-31 18:55:44	@indeedwatson	we could take a lot of examples like that and make them into a social issue
2015-12-31 18:55:53	RyanSmallwood	most feminists wouldn't be happy with rape being brought up flippantly to raise dramatic stakes in a man's story, and not deal with the woman's feelings appropraitely
2015-12-31 18:56:46	Porkepik	Oh yeah, that happens a lot :/
2015-12-31 18:56:54	Porkepik	Makes me think of AKira
2015-12-31 18:57:15	RyanSmallwood	Jessica Jones has been praised by lots of feminists, for dealing with the emotions of being raped without portraying rape on screen
2015-12-31 18:58:04	Porkepik	But then, what about movies like Irréversible ?
2015-12-31 18:58:20	Porkepik	it's very graphic, and it pretty much serves the purpose of continuing the story ?
2015-12-31 18:58:24	Porkepik	The reason of a revenge
2015-12-31 18:58:57	@indeedwatson	yeah JJ seems catered to that crowd
2015-12-31 19:01:53	RyanSmallwood	I dunno if its "catered" it has a lot of women involved in production and its an issue women face and hear about more commonly so I think they have more experience without how to deal with it appropriately
2015-12-31 19:02:50	@indeedwatson	but see i don't think it's anyone's place to judge what's appropriate
2015-12-31 19:03:37	RyanSmallwood	I think its just women making media they like
2015-12-31 19:04:24	RyanSmallwood	"appropriate" in the sense they want to address a real problem in a way that isn't uncomfortable for women to watch
2015-12-31 19:04:54	RyanSmallwood	don't limit their artistic expression by expecting them to cater to mass opinion ;)
2015-12-31 19:04:59	@indeedwatson	but it's dishonest and almost insulting to group women as a particular audience
2015-12-31 19:05:16	Porkepik	Well, we do it for kids
2015-12-31 19:05:26	@indeedwatson	that helps my point :p
2015-12-31 19:05:38	RyanSmallwood	not saying all women, but women statistically deal with it more frequently than men
2015-12-31 19:05:49	Porkepik	I wouldn't want a kid to watch a Noé movie, i'm kinda happy we take them for kids in that case
2015-12-31 19:06:36	Porkepik	I don't see how it helps your point tho
2015-12-31 19:06:39	RyanSmallwood	I'm just using women as a fuzzy grouping, not saying all women will or have to like it
2015-12-31 19:06:42	@indeedwatson	im talking about "that isn't uncomfortable for women to watch"
2015-12-31 19:06:52	@indeedwatson	Porkepik: because you're almost saying it's treating women like kids
2015-12-31 19:06:58	Porkepik	What ?
2015-12-31 19:07:04	Porkepik	No
2015-12-31 19:07:24	Porkepik	Kids represent a group in the audience
2015-12-31 19:07:28	Porkepik	like women
2015-12-31 19:07:31	Porkepik	like gay
2015-12-31 19:07:37	Porkepik	like people who likes chocolate
2015-12-31 19:08:23	@indeedwatson	but you're targetting an age group, a gender, and then 2 groups based on particular preferences
2015-12-31 19:08:38	Porkepik	And ?
2015-12-31 19:08:56	@indeedwatson	so, it'd be like saying "we're making gay movies for people who like chocolate". The fact that they're women doesn't tell you about what individuals will be touched by in art
2015-12-31 19:08:56	Porkepik	The common point between all of that is that they don't choose to be like that
2015-12-31 19:09:22	Porkepik	Yes, but in that case let's make movies for every individual person
2015-12-31 19:09:45	@indeedwatson	no, just express your artistic vision without bothering about sales or offending people
2015-12-31 19:10:10	Porkepik	Yeah obviously, but i also don't see anything wrong with people who actually want to be bothered
2015-12-31 19:10:20	@indeedwatson	if a movie has lazy writing, it has lazy writing, it doesn't have to be about sexism
2015-12-31 19:10:28	Porkepik	Making a movie so kids would be able to watch them, limiting yourself, isn't maybe such a bad thing no ?
2015-12-31 19:10:34	Porkepik	I mean from my pov, it can be interested
2015-12-31 19:10:36	Porkepik	interestingù
2015-12-31 19:10:51	@indeedwatson	if it has good writing and doesn't cater to a group of people, then don't compromise your artistic expression because of that
2015-12-31 19:11:12	Porkepik	Like people making movies for women who might have an issue with rape being visually represented, no ?
2015-12-31 19:11:33	Porkepik	Because themselves they might have an issue with it
2015-12-31 19:11:39	@indeedwatson	if that's their artistic vision sure
2015-12-31 19:12:02	Porkepik	But do you really need to make art always following your "artistic vision" ?
2015-12-31 19:12:33	@indeedwatson	you don't need to do anything, i just think it's more important and more honest
2015-12-31 19:15:28	RyanSmallwood	can't get into more depth, but it sounds like you're arguing against any generalizations and larger categoritizations
2015-12-31 19:15:42	Porkepik	me or watson ?
2015-12-31 19:15:48	RyanSmallwood	I think you can discuss larger categories without implying that its universally true for all of them
2015-12-31 19:15:49	RyanSmallwood	watson
2015-12-31 19:16:22	RyanSmallwood	rape is statistically more common for women, but withing that group they will be different opinions, but on average I think they're still skewed towards the grouping
2015-12-31 19:16:47	RyanSmallwood	anyways I see it as better for art in general
2015-12-31 19:17:11	@indeedwatson	i fail to see why it's an issue that's beside any other
2015-12-31 19:17:16	@indeedwatson	like representation of war
2015-12-31 19:17:18	RyanSmallwood	I've never been afraid I was going to be raped, but I prefer the way Jessica Jones portrays it over the way a lot of media in the past has
2015-12-31 19:17:38	RyanSmallwood	representation of war is worth discussing too
2015-12-31 19:17:43	@indeedwatson	or murder for that matter
2015-12-31 19:17:45	@indeedwatson	or being mugged
2015-12-31 19:18:16	@indeedwatson	do we look for the statistic majority of people who've been robbed or are likely to be robbed in order to know what's appropriate for a mugging scene?
2015-12-31 19:19:57	RyanSmallwood	I'm  not advocating for any media wide rules
2015-12-31 19:20:14	RyanSmallwood	just being conscious of how audiences respond
2015-12-31 19:20:25	@indeedwatson	i know im just trying to explain why i don't see it as a separate issue
2015-12-31 19:20:32	RyanSmallwood	if a lot of people voice issue that portrayals of robbery make them uncomfortable it would be worth listening
2015-12-31 19:21:10	Porkepik	But does that mean everybody should limit themselves and listen to it ?
2015-12-31 19:21:22	Porkepik	Just asking, not arguing
2015-12-31 19:21:37	@indeedwatson	to me there's no should
2015-12-31 19:21:43	@indeedwatson	to other people, yes
2015-12-31 19:22:07	RyanSmallwood	well I mentioned before I think, and I think a lot of feminists think something like rape porn is fine because its serving a narrow demographic
2015-12-31 19:22:20	RyanSmallwood	just being open to hearing other people's opinions
2015-12-31 19:22:39	@indeedwatson	my friend's argument about rick & morty for example was "rape is never funny", not only i disagree but the scene in particular was pretty uncomfortable and not funny 
2015-12-31 19:22:42	Porkepik	So if i watch Irréversible and fap to it it's ok ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
2015-12-31 19:22:48	@indeedwatson	hahah
2015-12-31 19:23:00	RyanSmallwood	Porkepik: yeah as long as you don't hurt anyone else
2015-12-31 19:23:41	Porkepik	Oh cool, i agree with that
2015-12-31 19:23:51	Porkepik	So, in this case, drugs should be legal
2015-12-31 19:23:55	Porkepik	YEAH I DID IT !
2015-12-31 19:24:04	Porkepik	I manage to talk about drugs after rape
2015-12-31 19:24:17	Porkepik	That's some sort of life accomplishment i shouldn't be proud of
2015-12-31 19:30:47	RyanSmallwood	I think when reading feminist writing its important to just think of it as opinions, and not rules they want to impose on everything, most things feminists want in media isn't anything that's going to destroy artistic integrity
2015-12-31 19:31:37	RyanSmallwood	Feminist Frequency videos sometimes have more extreme views than I agree with, but I'm glad she's out there saying how she feels
2015-12-31 19:32:44	Porkepik	Yeah, she has a right to express herself, but it's hard for me to take her seriously
2015-12-31 19:34:03	RyanSmallwood	she does a good job of laying out some basic feminist principles, but she also has fairly extreme views on portrayals of sexuality and violence in media
2015-12-31 19:34:21	Porkepik	I would take any statement she could make independantly but judge it as fairly as i can, but the truth is that i don't really want to listen to her
2015-12-31 19:34:30	Porkepik	It's sad, but a lot of people can feel like that
2015-12-31 19:40:59	@indeedwatson	to me, i just don't enjoy art criticism from a social stand

2015-12-31 19:41:49	@indeedwatson	either critique a movie on its merits as a movie, or make your own art that expresses what you feel, instead of expecting other artists to do so
2015-12-31 19:43:45	RyanSmallwood	I dunno, I think critiquing any aspect is fair game, don't have to make everything you consume to critique it
2015-12-31 19:44:11	RyanSmallwood	most feminists I read would prefer not to be doing feminist criticism, they only do it because they're annoyed with the media available
2015-12-31 19:46:59	@indeedwatson	i guess i relate when i read/watch criticism of pandering to wide audiences for monetary reasons
2015-12-31 19:48:27	@indeedwatson	the cases that you mention of for example showing a woman about to be raped to add tension, i don't think removing that scene would make the film better because usually the issue is just bad writing permeating through the whole thing
2015-12-31 19:49:50	RyanSmallwood	there's a diverse array of feminist criticism, some groups go way overboard with it
2015-12-31 19:50:39	RyanSmallwood	I dunno, most of the feminists make fairly modest demands, and I can get down with more stuff like MMFA, TFA, and JJ which I think were all lots of fun, and appealed to most feminists I read

2015-12-31 22:21:39	RyanSmallwood	sorry if I'm harping on this, but do you remember what the rick and morty rape joke was indeedwatson ?
2015-12-31 22:21:59	@indeedwatson	it wasn't a joke
2015-12-31 22:22:03	@indeedwatson	have you seen the show?
2015-12-31 22:22:10	RyanSmallwood	only one episode I think
2015-12-31 22:22:40	@indeedwatson	well maybe you've noticed that the episodes tend to diverge into two plots, one mostly with the family and one with rick and morty
2015-12-31 22:23:11	@indeedwatson	i don't want to give too much away but basically morty saw himself in that situation being threatened
2015-12-31 22:23:17	@indeedwatson	and it's pretty uncomfortable
2015-12-31 22:23:50	@indeedwatson	that show gets "too real" on several occasions and it's one of the reasons i love it

2015-12-31 23:04:49	Porkepik	Well, i liked it
2015-12-31 23:05:03	Porkepik	Obviously ... Hard to agree with his view on communism/capitalism
2015-12-31 23:05:29	Porkepik	But outside of that, it was mesmerizing
2015-12-31 23:05:53	Porkepik	I love how he whispers everything, and he stills has interesting thoughts
2015-12-31 23:06:22	@indeedwatson	what are you talking about
2015-12-31 23:06:36	Porkepik	2 or 3 things i know about her
2015-12-31 23:07:34	Porkepik	Also, i laugh multiple times
2015-12-31 23:08:04	Porkepik	Between the guy taking random books that have nothing in common for whatever the fuck they're writting
2015-12-31 23:08:12	RyanSmallwood	I don't think he was communist til after weekend... but I'm not sure...
2015-12-31 23:08:30	Porkepik	And with the fake american dude asking them to wear the bags on their heads
2015-12-31 23:08:50	Porkepik	Yeah, but he still has some concern about how capitalism is healthy to France no ?
2015-12-31 23:09:26	RyanSmallwood	yeah he was kind of passively critical, but interested in popularity of communism in the younger generation
2015-12-31 23:09:41	RyanSmallwood	I didn't want to include yet another godard in the list
2015-12-31 23:10:00	RyanSmallwood	but in masculin feminin, there's an inter-title along the lines of "this is the generation of marx and pepsi cola" or something
2015-12-31 23:10:32	RyanSmallwood	so I think he was kind of critiquing capitalism and also studying political extremists in france
2015-12-31 23:11:00	RyanSmallwood	but I don't think it was until he met Jean-Pierre Gorin that he became a full communist and stopped making films the same way
2015-12-31 23:11:07	RyanSmallwood	and Weekend was like his goodbye to cinema film
2015-12-31 23:11:26	RyanSmallwood	I dunno thats very rough and probably wrong, haven't finished reading his biography yet
2015-12-31 23:12:14	RyanSmallwood	you can see a growing interest in communism as he approaches Weekend though
2015-12-31 23:17:40	Porkepik	Well, good night

2016-01-02 11:39:09	RyanSmallwood	tempted to watch 2 films today and get there early...
2016-01-02 11:39:36	Mothravka	You go.
2016-01-02 11:40:36	@indeedwatson	i should find a list to follow this year
2016-01-02 11:46:55	RyanSmallwood	indeedwatson: you interested in watching a specific movement or period? or going through more of the greats?

2016-01-02 11:47:34	@indeedwatson	i think i need to go through the greats overall first
2016-01-02 11:47:34	Mothravka	Gotta love that soundtrack.
2016-01-02 11:47:49	@indeedwatson	because i don't really know what movements i like enough to dedicate a lot of time
2016-01-02 11:48:46	RyanSmallwood	I gotta catch up on more of the great films from the 70s and after
2016-01-02 11:49:09	Mothravka	I gotta catch up on much.
2016-01-02 11:49:41	RyanSmallwood	Mothravka: what's this soundtrack from?
2016-01-02 11:50:13	RyanSmallwood	directors in the 60s and 70s start getting too smart for me. they've read more Hegel than I have
2016-01-02 11:50:17	Mothravka	RyanSmallwood: It's from Throw Away Your Books, Rally in the Streets (1971) by Shûji Terayama.
2016-01-02 11:51:02	RyanSmallwood	I'll have to add that to the non-existent watch list in my head
2016-01-02 11:51:45	Mothravka	And Pastoral: To Die in the Country (1974)!
2016-01-02 11:52:09	Mothravka	Someone did a Criterion-esque trailer for that one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JXWvblS3S8
2016-01-02 11:52:10		[ http://is.gd/chjnr9 ]
2016-01-02 11:52:22	Mothravka	One of the best Japanese movies ever made.
2016-01-02 11:52:45	Mothravka	And that soundtrack is brilliant as well.
2016-01-02 11:56:34	RyanSmallwood	all these 70s movies are completely off my radar, I'm missing out
2016-01-02 11:56:56	Mothravka	Too many movies, too little time.
2016-01-02 12:03:28	RyanSmallwood	I gotta dive into new german cinema...
2016-01-02 12:05:08	Mothravka	Total Fassbinder worship!
2016-01-02 12:05:32	Mothravka	Can't wait for the Fassbinder box set from Arrow to arrive.
2016-01-02 12:05:49	RyanSmallwood	I've seen a good amount of Fassbinder, but not much beyond his films
2016-01-02 12:06:19	RyanSmallwood	seems like the main dude of the 1970s
2016-01-02 12:06:35	Mothravka	It was almost too long ago I watched a Fassbinder films, have to start seeing the stuff I have left.
2016-01-02 12:06:41	Mothravka	film*
2016-01-02 12:07:32	Mothravka	I rewatched The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant (1972) a while ago though.
2016-01-02 12:07:45	RyanSmallwood	that's a pretty great one

2016-01-02 12:22:59	RyanSmallwood	I'm probably just thinking this cause I'm reading Hegel, but Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant reminds me a lot of Hegel's  master/slave dialectic
2016-01-02 12:23:36	RyanSmallwood	Though those ideas might be filtered through other philosophies at the time like I think Foucault was writing about sex and power structures
2016-01-02 12:23:47	RyanSmallwood	I'd be curious to learn more about Fassbinder's philosophical influences
2016-01-02 12:25:59	Mothravka	I don't think you are that far off at all with that. I would absolutely say that it has to do with submission/dominance and power structures.
2016-01-02 12:27:05	Mothravka	It also makes me think a lot about stoicism and how Petra and Marlene can both be seen as a split personality.
2016-01-02 12:30:21	RyanSmallwood	ahh, I dunno much about stoicism
2016-01-02 12:34:54	Mothravka	But it mostly comes down to the submission/dominance part anyways, I think. If one examines what Petra is doing and how she is dealing with things. The part I'm thinking about the most is that she's pretending to show her feelings while simultaneously controlling what situation she is in, and as well to appease others (submission). At the same time
2016-01-02 12:34:54	Mothravka	, she doesn't let other to get to know her (dominance) and doesn't either want to be alone (submission).
2016-01-02 12:35:17	Mothravka	others*

2016-01-02 12:40:41	Mothravka	Then you also have Marlene. Marlene simply feels like the Petra who feels the emotions the real Petra refuses to feel.
2016-01-02 12:44:18	RyanSmallwood	The Hegelian Master/Slave dialectic is about how a consciousness can manipulate inanimate matter, but when it runs into another consciousness they can  either mutually recognize each other's  independence as another consciousness or enter   into a death struggle where one submits the other to its will and becomes the master and the slave. And becau
2016-01-02 12:44:19	RyanSmallwood	se  a consciousness  can only know itself through other  consciousness  in a master/slave dialectic the master is not really free because it is only acknowledge in so far as it is forcing the slave to submit to its well and not being fully recognized as a conciousness
2016-01-02 12:45:24	RyanSmallwood	So Petra has this material power over Marlene and can force her to submit to her in a way (albeit more hidden than a death struggle, but kind of the same thing) be she also wants recognition from another human being and because she's not recognizing Marlene for her own consciousness  and ideas, she doesn't get recognition in return
2016-01-02 12:47:29	Mothravka	It's very interesting, because it feels like Petra is whole again when Marlene packs her bag and leaves. As if Petra is whole again and somehow merged together with her true feelings.

2016-01-03 10:55:09	Mothravka	Not much. What's up with you?

2016-01-03 10:55:40	Porkepikk	Went to bed too latr
2016-01-03 10:55:44	Mothravka	Heh.
2016-01-03 10:56:09	Mothravka	I have to get more into Indian cinema and examine it deeper soon too.
2016-01-03 10:57:24	Porkepikk	Now that filmmaking is quite accessible, there is quite a lot of countries to get interested in
2016-01-03 10:57:40	Mothravka	Indeed!
2016-01-03 10:59:01	RyanSmallwood	indian cinema is pretty fascinating
2016-01-03 10:59:17	RyanSmallwood	I've scratched the surface, want to look deeper at some point though
2016-01-03 10:59:28	Mothravka	I agree. Same with me.
2016-01-03 11:00:02	Mothravka	I've only seen around ~45 Indian films.
2016-01-03 11:00:28	Mothravka	But I have a lot of stuff in my "Indian watchlist".

2016-01-03 11:03:46	Porkepikk	Well 7 hours something
2016-01-03 11:04:11	Mothravka	Almost as long as Sátántangó (1994)!
2016-01-03 11:04:42	Porkepikk	Yeah should have done a sleepless night and go on with godard filmography :P
2016-01-03 11:04:52	Porkepikk	Sleep is overrated anyway

2016-01-03 11:06:50	@indeedwatson	yeah no hurry
2016-01-03 11:09:57	Porkepikk	I'm sure there will be at least a bergman and tarkovsky in the list
2016-01-03 11:10:04	Porkepikk	And a tarr maybe

2016-01-03 11:13:06	Porkepikk	You have something like 25 or 27 films that are i guess his favorites
2016-01-03 11:13:28	Mothravka	Yeah, I have 27 films that I have given a 5/5 rating each.
2016-01-03 11:14:05	Mothravka	I have rewatched some great stuff lately though, so I might expand it a bit.

2016-01-03 11:42:54	Porkepik	He is so inventive with editing
2016-01-03 11:44:08	Porkepik	I like how he manage to make traffic jam annoying in a very realist way
2016-01-03 11:44:27	Porkepik	Camera panning very slowly, those fucking honkings making me crazy i had to turn the volume a little bit down
2016-01-03 11:44:40	Porkepik	He really didn't give a shit at that moment
2016-01-03 11:45:01	Porkepik	It's some sort of anti-cinema
2016-01-03 11:45:40	Mothravka	Week End (1967) is a wonderful middle finger.
2016-01-03 11:45:44	Mothravka	I have to rewatch it soon.
2016-01-03 11:45:49	Porkepik	Tho the hardsubs were actually quite annoying cause i guess the music being louder than the dialogues
2016-01-03 11:46:13	Porkepik	So i manage to pretty much understand all the dialogues cause i would refer to them as a reflex when i shouldn't be able to hear it
2016-01-03 11:46:32	Porkepik	than the dialogues (is done on purpose)*

2016-01-03 13:09:20	@indeedwatson	i think the 60s is the most represented decade
2016-01-03 13:09:37	TempSpastic	60s was pretty big
2016-01-03 13:10:09	AlexJ44	Elephant, Solaris, The Apartment, The Long goodbye, vertigo, waking life, taxi driver, through a glass darkly, 2001 space odyssey, before sunrise
2016-01-03 13:10:15	AlexJ44	that'll do
2016-01-03 13:11:03	@Carson	I have a personal connection to those films too
2016-01-03 13:11:22	@Carson	just were my entry point into liking more complex films
2016-01-03 13:11:24	@indeedwatson	AlexJ44: im assuming original solaris right?
2016-01-03 13:11:31	AlexJ44	yes, tarkovsky's
2016-01-03 13:12:11	AlexJ44	who picked incendies?
2016-01-03 13:13:14	@Carson	go watch tree of life if you haven't
2016-01-03 13:13:22	@Carson	it's a bit hit or miss with most people
2016-01-03 13:13:26	@indeedwatson	i wish i could add tags to the movies in the list
2016-01-03 13:13:32	@indeedwatson	Carson: i've seen it but years ago
2016-01-03 13:13:44	@indeedwatson	i'll rewatch movies i've seen more than a year ago
2016-01-03 13:15:18	AlexJ44	yes, I've seen it too, but way too long ago
2016-01-03 13:15:24	AlexJ44	I think I was too young to appreciate it
2016-01-03 13:16:27	@indeedwatson	i liked it but im guessing i'll like it more on rewatch
2016-01-03 13:18:02	@indeedwatson	61 films
2016-01-03 13:18:09	AlexJ44	i remember sean penn lost at sea
2016-01-03 13:18:52	@indeedwatson	i remember dinosaurs and brad pitt with a very american accent
2016-01-03 13:19:09	AlexJ44	oh yes! there were dinosaurs too
2016-01-03 13:19:16	AlexJ44	I haven't watched a film yesterday
2016-01-03 13:19:19	AlexJ44	I should make up for that
2016-01-03 13:19:31	@indeedwatson	there's a distinct lack of animated films now that I think about it

2016-01-03 13:21:37	@indeedwatson	i can't recall who added incendies
2016-01-03 13:21:44	@indeedwatson	Card1974 was it you?
2016-01-03 13:22:29	@indeedwatson	yes it was him 
2016-01-03 13:23:08	AlexJ44	it's a curious film
2016-01-03 13:23:12	AlexJ44	probably villeneuve's best
2016-01-03 13:25:01	@indeedwatson	i've liked everything i've seen by him

2016-01-03 17:30:07	AlexJ44	more so today
2016-01-03 17:30:56	AlexJ44	has anyone seen it?
2016-01-03 17:31:37	AlexJ44	it was nice seeing Mastroianni in it, because I usually think of his in fellini's films. la notte has some fellini to it too though, with the party and all
2016-01-03 17:31:43	@indeedwatson	it's in my list i think Porkepik put it there
2016-01-03 17:31:46	AlexJ44	i'm not sure that was intentional
2016-01-03 17:32:36	Porkepik	La Notte is my favorite Antonioni so far
2016-01-03 17:34:12	AlexJ44	how many have you seen?
2016-01-03 17:34:26	Porkepik	4
2016-01-03 17:34:34	Porkepik	Need to see Blow up and his later work
2016-01-03 17:34:59	AlexJ44	I don't get most of his films
2016-01-03 17:34:59	Porkepik	Maybe The Cry, tho it doesn't seem to be part of his best films
2016-01-03 17:35:04	AlexJ44	he's very cryptic
2016-01-03 17:35:17	Porkepik	I don't think so
2016-01-03 17:35:21	AlexJ44	one of my favorite bergman is not one of his best
2016-01-03 17:35:28	Porkepik	It's about the struggle of communication in modern relationship
2016-01-03 17:35:57	AlexJ44	ah yes, but he's communicating a lot with his images
2016-01-03 17:36:12	Porkepik	Well, he is actually not communicating that much, like the couples are
2016-01-03 17:36:14	Porkepik	It's very empty
2016-01-03 17:36:23	Porkepik	There is something beautiful about that tho
2016-01-03 17:36:32	Porkepik	What seems to be empty sometimes actually isn't
2016-01-03 17:37:13	AlexJ44	i don't know, I've seen his l'avventura with commentary
2016-01-03 17:37:28	AlexJ44	and from what i've read, the architecture plays a huge part in his cinematography
2016-01-03 17:37:43	Porkepik	Yeah, very obvious with L'Eclisse and Red Desert
2016-01-03 17:37:51	AlexJ44	not so much with the other two?
2016-01-03 17:38:05	Porkepik	The environnement in which the characters are set up is part of their development, to me at least
2016-01-03 17:38:15	Porkepik	Well, it's less obvious at some point
2016-01-03 17:38:24	AlexJ44	but I should investigate this matroianni thing
2016-01-03 17:38:55	AlexJ44	well, i'm leaving to watch creed

2016-01-04 00:47:40	AlexJ44	how was the big short?
2016-01-04 00:47:44	AlexJ44	it's got a good cast
2016-01-04 00:47:54	AlexJ44	although it seemed a bit silly on the trailers
2016-01-04 00:49:23	keqin	it's definitely comedic
2016-01-04 00:49:29	keqin	Adam McKay from Anchorman directed it
2016-01-04 00:50:11	keqin	it's pretty educational, and they incorporate a lot of comedy to get the dry details across to you
2016-01-04 00:51:33	keqin	the cinematography was really casual -- improvised long lens and close-ups instead of tight staging
2016-01-04 00:53:46	keqin	i guess it could be considered an ensemble biopic

2016-01-04 15:34:57	Digitalis2512	yup
2016-01-04 15:35:07	AlexJ44	it's a very dire film
2016-01-04 15:35:12	AlexJ44	just pay attention to the themes
2016-01-04 15:35:15	AlexJ44	the use of lightning
2016-01-04 15:35:25	AlexJ44	why is this a special story?
2016-01-04 15:35:57	Digitalis2512	Yes, I was looking at the lighting with the Passion of Joan in mind
2016-01-04 15:36:11	AlexJ44	i haven't watch that one yet
2016-01-04 15:36:23	AlexJ44	i ahould rewatch ordet though
2016-01-04 15:37:42	Digitalis2512	I don't mind the story so far, it is similar to ones done here in Ireland. You should absolutly watch Joan, though bear in mind that there is no official soundtrack so quality varies

2016-01-04 18:08:27	Digitalis2512	I'm not really comfortable with making a top 10 yet, I notice though that there is no Kurosawa
2016-01-04 18:09:08	muskrat	indeedwatson, regarding dawn of the dead - that's ok
2016-01-04 18:09:15	@indeedwatson	muskrat it's ok, i said 10 just to say a number
2016-01-04 18:09:33	muskrat	oh :)
2016-01-04 18:09:35	@indeedwatson	Digitalis2512: yeah that's weird, there's also no animated films or documentaries i think
2016-01-04 18:09:45	@indeedwatson	Digitalis2512: also if you want you can make a top 5 or top 3
2016-01-04 18:10:03	Digitalis2512	No, you have Grave of the Fireflies and Princess Mononoke
2016-01-04 18:10:19	@indeedwatson	oh yeah
2016-01-04 18:10:31	@indeedwatson	i got confused because i didn't add them at first, because i had already seen them
2016-01-04 18:10:38	@indeedwatson	but then i thought i should add them anyway

2016-01-04 18:15:13	Digitalis2512	I would put Red in my top 5 of this year. What about an Ozu?

2016-01-04 18:16:05	muskrat	listening to that atm

2016-01-04 18:16:16	@indeedwatson	i need to watch more Ozu too
2016-01-04 18:16:21	Card1974	I should watch them again someday.
2016-01-04 18:17:14	Card1974	...especially since I watched Blue on VHS...
2016-01-04 18:17:15	Digitalis2512	Preferring White? That's unusual, can you remember why?
2016-01-04 18:17:27	Digitalis2512	Grand Illusion was good

2016-01-04 19:40:04	Carson-PHONE	Serial is a bit stretched out as a series
2016-01-04 19:41:06	RyanSmallwood	I only listened to the first episode, but after making such a huge deal out of people having terrible memories I was like "where can the series go from here?" and read a review saying it basically went against what it said from the first episode and tried to reconstruct events from crappy memories even though there's really not much to know
2016-01-04 19:43:04	AlexJ44	serial was fun
2016-01-04 19:43:17	AlexJ44	I liked it, because I was involved with radio at the time and it was an interesting experien ce

2016-01-04 19:47:55	@indeedwatson	RyanSmallwood: about Serial, that's the whole thing. If you think it's bad to make a podcast out of people's fuzzy memories, imagine putting someone in jail based on fuzzy memories and witness accounts
2016-01-04 19:48:54	RyanSmallwood	I don't have anything wrong with the podcast
2016-01-04 19:49:28	RyanSmallwood	just if its only going to be speculating about unknown things I didn't really want to spend time listening to it
2016-01-04 19:49:32	AlexJ44	you have a problem with it's structural contradiction
2016-01-04 19:50:13	AlexJ44	I suppose what it did was show us that there was, say, a 1/10 chance he did it, and he got judged and arrested on that 1/10 chance, all the while showing us the other 9/10 chances

2016-01-04 19:52:42	AlexJ44	but at some point, he's like "you don't really know me, you can't say you know me just over the phone" or something, and she replies "well, how can you say that?" in a really flirty way
2016-01-04 19:53:02	AlexJ44	you could sense some romantic tension there

2016-01-04 19:54:50	AlexJ44	haha yeah, not saying it was blatant
2016-01-04 19:54:54	AlexJ44	has s02 started?!
2016-01-04 19:55:17	@indeedwatson	yes there's like 4 ep already
2016-01-04 19:57:13	AlexJ44	oh nice, have you been listening to it?
2016-01-04 19:58:57	@indeedwatson	only 1 ep so far
2016-01-04 19:59:03	AlexJ44	is it nice?
2016-01-04 19:59:18	AlexJ44	ah man, I'm so tired, but I wanted to watch something + study for tomorrow's exam
2016-01-04 20:01:33	@indeedwatson	yeah
2016-01-04 20:01:41	@indeedwatson	it's a pretty different story tho
2016-01-04 20:02:04	@indeedwatson	it's funny that i never heard of these stories but it seems they were big news at the time
2016-01-04 20:03:06	tomflint	the new serial is so much different than the first
2016-01-04 20:04:02	AlexJ44	is it tom?
2016-01-04 20:04:24	AlexJ44	(i made a pizza some days ago, no cheese and with pre-made sauce and dough, it was still pizza and still very eatable 6/10)
2016-01-04 20:04:31	tomflint	its got a slower build up, I guess. I'm just not as into it as the first season
2016-01-04 20:04:36	AlexJ44	gonna listen to the first one
2016-01-04 20:04:46	tomflint	its still good though
2016-01-04 20:05:24	tomflint	it might just be that I don't believe in the role of the military and could care less about anything that happens involving it ---
2016-01-04 20:05:27	tomflint	who knows..
2016-01-04 20:06:50	AlexJ44	oh, it's about the taliban
2016-01-04 20:06:56	AlexJ44	could be interesting
2016-01-04 20:07:06	RyanSmallwood	seems like a tricky thing to try to "re-create" since you have to find another story as interesting as the first
2016-01-04 20:07:37	tomflint	oh man, the worst act to follow
2016-01-04 20:07:45	tomflint	especially with the on-going cult following
2016-01-04 20:08:05	@indeedwatson	tomflint: i feel the same way about the military but what catches me is that "mystery"
2016-01-04 20:08:20	@indeedwatson	this reminds me of The Wire s02, just go with a completely different subject
2016-01-04 20:08:46	tomflint	and not just for Koenig, but Serial has really rescued This American Life and set a path for massive success for Ira Glass and his now-independent business.
2016-01-04 20:08:52	tomflint	ha
2016-01-04 20:09:17	@indeedwatson	i knew serial was more popular than TAL but i didn't know about that
2016-01-04 20:09:43	tomflint	so, Ira Glass had done TAL for about 20 years but was never able to break away from PRX ---
2016-01-04 20:10:09	AlexJ44	RyanSmallwood: who's your favorite, or favorites, film analysts? i'm wondering because I wanted to read/watch/anything more on antonioni and solaris
2016-01-04 20:10:26	tomflint	purely because they didn't have the funds. So once podcasting blew up, they got a little extra cash coming in, but not enough to take it away himself. Serial brought that in and crushed all This American Life records almost immediately
2016-01-04 20:10:51	@indeedwatson	nice
2016-01-04 20:11:36	@indeedwatson	btw tomflint, make me a list of 10 fav films to add to my watchlist
2016-01-04 20:12:23	tomflint	haha
2016-01-04 20:12:38	tomflint	ok... one sec. I'll have to think this through
2016-01-04 20:12:41	@indeedwatson	if you want :p
2016-01-04 20:13:11	RyanSmallwood	AlexJ44: usually for specific directors I try to find an author who's an expert on that country in film history. I haven't found much to reach on antonioni or tarkosvky, I read a compilation of interviews with Antonioni, and I read Tarkovsky's sculpting in time.  Haven't explored much further, but   David  Forgacs knows a shitton about Italian cine
2016-01-04 20:13:12	RyanSmallwood	ma, and his commentary on Red Desert is pretty great
2016-01-04 20:13:27	RyanSmallwood	*much to read
2016-01-04 20:13:40	AlexJ44	is sculpting in time good?
2016-01-04 20:13:45	RyanSmallwood	very good
2016-01-04 20:13:57	AlexJ44	should I read it without watching much of his?
2016-01-04 20:14:12	AlexJ44	or should you have that knowledge beforehand ?
2016-01-04 20:14:37	@indeedwatson	i stopped reading that near the end cause he talked a lot about sacrifice and nostalgia
2016-01-04 20:14:56	@indeedwatson	RyanSmallwood: have you read that book that is all about Stalker?
2016-01-04 20:14:58	RyanSmallwood	hmm I already watched most of his films, but I think it works either way. You could read it before and after
2016-01-04 20:15:11	RyanSmallwood	nope what book is about Stalker?

2016-01-04 20:28:45	Carson-PHONE	All the cgi edits are painful in the special
2016-01-04 20:28:48	RyanSmallwood	Does anyone know if Disney could actually do an official restoration of the original cuts now that Lucas sold it to them? I read some think pieces on it, but none seemed to explain the rights issues clearly.
2016-01-04 20:29:14	tomflint	i doubt it
2016-01-04 20:29:21	tomflint	Disney doesn't care about restoration at all
2016-01-04 20:29:27	tomflint	even Lucas didn't care that much

2016-01-04 20:31:03	tomflint	comparing the various versions out there, its clear that every new version is worse than the previous
2016-01-04 20:31:07	Carson-PHONE	I want to do a comparison watch
2016-01-04 20:31:27	RyanSmallwood	I think someone made a video with all the changes Lucas made to the original trilogy over time
2016-01-04 20:31:45	RyanSmallwood	I forgot to watch it though
2016-01-04 20:31:47	tomflint	the original ones (laserdisc, vhs, and even DVD) were all designed for CRTs -- so that makes sense. But they should release a proper one now

2016-01-04 20:34:56	tomflint	Straczynski asked fans to petition the studio to do a remastering
2016-01-04 20:35:23	tomflint	I think it'll happen now that they can see that people went craaaaazy over the TNG remastering
2016-01-04 20:35:26	tomflint	same with X-Files

2016-01-04 20:37:36	RyanSmallwood	I think Babylon 5 is harder, because they'd  have to re-do all the CGI
2016-01-04 20:37:43	RyanSmallwood	from scratch
2016-01-04 20:37:49	tomflint	they did it for TNG though

2016-01-04 20:41:30	RyanSmallwood	Babylon 5 is great because its whole storyline was planned in advance, which was completely unheard of for TV at the time
2016-01-04 20:41:37	muskrat	and it's a bit more difficult to recall the differences between them

2016-01-04 20:44:49	RyanSmallwood	the pilot is slightly controversial too though isn't it? They re-did it and it winks at some later things I think

2016-01-04 20:50:35	Card1974	and I have a hunch JMS still has a story he desperately wants us to see. The aborted TV movie spinoffs all have the same basic premise... a single ship with a ragtag team and some big menace to give them something to do.
2016-01-04 20:51:35	Card1974	But JMS is somewhat bad at the 90 minute format. at the 43 minute tv episodes, his writing and pacing is great.

2016-01-04 22:37:14	RyanSmallwood	did you write down any movies from the documentary that you wanted to watch?
2016-01-04 22:37:55	@indeedwatson	me?
2016-01-04 22:39:25	RyanSmallwood	yeah, since you're looking for a list of movies to watch, I was wondering if you got any from The Story of Film

2016-01-04 22:40:11	@indeedwatson	oh, i have the pdf that mentions
2016-01-04 22:40:17	@indeedwatson	yeah that one
2016-01-04 22:40:38	RyanSmallwood	I just meant ones that you personally wanted to check out after seeing the clips
2016-01-04 22:41:23	@indeedwatson	i should've written them down but i didn't :/
2016-01-04 22:42:52	@indeedwatson	there was one that really made me want to watch it, and i don't think i had heard or read about it anywhere else, but i can't remember the title
2016-01-04 22:43:00	@indeedwatson	i'll have to skim a few episodes
2016-01-04 22:53:54	@indeedwatson	found it

2016-01-05 20:28:20	Porkepik	Apa was great, tho the acting at the beginning a bit weird

2016-01-05 20:28:42	RyanSmallwood	heh

2016-01-05 20:29:59	Porkepik	The story was good, tho i mostly remember the sets
2016-01-05 20:30:08	Porkepik	like when they push the tram
2016-01-05 20:30:28	Porkepik	also the panning shot where he is avoiding the bombing
2016-01-05 20:30:53	Porkepik	The Cremator was incredible, now i can see Czech movies are one hell of a show
2016-01-05 20:31:15	Porkepik	i can safely say*

2016-01-06 22:04:24	RyanSmallwood	yuuuuuup
2016-01-06 22:04:38	Porkepik	Loved it, it was first kinda confusing
2016-01-06 22:05:28	Porkepik	The fact that you have a very neutral point of views, you don't really have any main characters, so what is the camera following ? Seems like we were kinda jumping through places and witnessing the tragic events happening
2016-01-06 22:05:38	RyanSmallwood	yeah a lot of times its just small people in the distance dehumanizing each other
2016-01-06 22:06:38	Porkepik	Yeah, we're just seeing a man dying, a woman being harrased or someone executing orders
2016-01-06 22:07:08	Porkepik	Also, seems like Jancso love to center his movies around prisoners
2016-01-06 22:07:21	Porkepik	In this one, the soldiers are pretty much playing with them
2016-01-06 22:08:26	RyanSmallwood	yeah that's pretty common in Jancso films
2016-01-06 22:09:10	Porkepik	It was also way ruthless than the 2 first, i think
2016-01-06 22:09:23	Porkepik	I certainly think that cause compared to Round-up we get to see civilians
2016-01-06 22:09:35	Porkepik	They're pretty much the only people who can really relate to and care about
2016-01-06 22:10:12	Porkepik	And there are so many horses in his movies ! Always more and more of them
2016-01-06 22:10:42	Porkepik	And bird tweeting
2016-01-06 22:10:53	Porkepik	birds*
2016-01-06 22:11:38	Porkepik	(i think tweeting is the sound birds make right ?)
2016-01-06 22:14:33	RyanSmallwood	(yup)
2016-01-06 22:16:10	RyanSmallwood	and yeah it was a Soviet co-production to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the October revolution
2016-01-06 22:16:30	RyanSmallwood	needless to say they weren't that thrilled with the film Jancso delivered
2016-01-06 22:16:52	Porkepik	ahahaha i guess so
2016-01-06 22:16:58	RyanSmallwood	but I think it might be his biggest film in terms of scale
2016-01-06 22:17:56	Porkepik	Yeah, i hope i will be able to see more from him soon
2016-01-06 22:18:53	Porkepik	His filmmaking techniques are very interesting
2016-01-06 22:19:10	RyanSmallwood	Red Psalm is another interesting one to check out, its sort of a folk musical, but also very much in line with his style
2016-01-06 22:19:33	RyanSmallwood	and in color
2016-01-06 22:20:05	Porkepik	I start to have struggle remembering if a movie was in B&W or colors :/
2016-01-06 22:20:22	Porkepik	I was so many of both right now :D
2016-01-06 22:20:26	Porkepik	i watch*
2016-01-06 22:20:29	RyanSmallwood	heh
2016-01-06 22:20:55	RyanSmallwood	you're saving all the longer movies for last >_<
2016-01-06 22:21:28	Porkepik	Fuck ... you noticed :|
2016-01-06 22:21:44	Porkepik	Well, most of them are at the end :D
2016-01-06 22:22:10	RyanSmallwood	yeah but you've been skipping over some too! :P
2016-01-06 22:22:30	Porkepik	http://puu.sh/mmkl6/ad3aeda193.jpg
2016-01-06 22:22:30		[ http://is.gd/A5y4ya ]
2016-01-06 22:22:34	Porkepik	Oh yeah sorry :/
2016-01-06 22:22:47	Porkepik	Well, kinda hard to do one after the other
2016-01-06 22:23:13	TempSpastic	hit up Playtime
2016-01-06 22:24:38	Porkepik	Yeah, first I am twenty and The Pornographers
2016-01-06 22:25:19	RyanSmallwood	woo!
2016-01-06 22:25:47	Porkepik	Took more time than i expected
2016-01-06 22:25:59	Porkepik	But it's ok, i also watched some other movies in between
2016-01-06 22:26:30	RyanSmallwood	its also a good chunk of great cinema to get through
2016-01-06 22:26:50	RyanSmallwood	don't have to rush through too fast, can let a good movie sit for a while before seeing the next one
2016-01-06 22:28:12	Porkepik	Yeah, well at least i have everything downloaded
2016-01-06 22:28:21	RyanSmallwood	:)
2016-01-06 22:28:21	Porkepik	Will start doing the same for the other list now
2016-01-06 22:28:30	RyanSmallwood	which list are you doing next?
2016-01-06 22:28:52	Porkepik	French Homework i guess, may take a break in between tho
2016-01-06 22:29:16	Porkepik	Breath a bit, watch some movies i had in mind

2016-01-07 10:12:50	@indeedwatson	“The Ridiculous Six” has been seen more times in 30 days than any other movie in Netflix history
2016-01-07 10:12:53	@indeedwatson	this makes me sad
2016-01-07 10:14:03	Porkepikk	Meh, the adam sandler fanbase is pretty much the same than netflix userbase
2016-01-07 10:14:58	Porkepikk	And they made a big thing out of it, like a special release, what they call a watch coule just be someone clicking on it then leaving after a few seconds or minutes

2016-01-08 21:22:09	RyanSmallwood	yeah, watching HK films year by year starting at 1965
2016-01-08 21:22:20	RyanSmallwood	then turning it into a video essay for each year
2016-01-08 21:30:58	Digitalis2512	Finished an essay yet?
2016-01-08 21:33:02	RyanSmallwood	Nope, this is my first one :)
2016-01-08 21:33:25	Digitalis2512	Thoughts so far?
2016-01-08 21:33:52	RyanSmallwood	heh its tricky to say so far
2016-01-08 21:34:13	RyanSmallwood	err *tricky to sum up so far
2016-01-08 21:34:19	RyanSmallwood	this is when Shaw Brothers transitioned from Huang Mei Diao Operas to  Wuxia
2016-01-08 21:34:34	RyanSmallwood	I didn't really see that many Huang Mei Diao operas, so I was suprised at how much fighting was in them
2016-01-08 21:34:38	RyanSmallwood	I thought they were all romances
2016-01-08 21:35:03	RyanSmallwood	I didn't really understand the separate Mandarin and Cantonese industries until now watching them side by side
2016-01-08 21:35:24	RyanSmallwood	The first wuxia film from Shaw Brothers is awesome, and I'm excited to see how the genre evolves
2016-01-08 21:36:04	RyanSmallwood	heh and lots more details to flesh out in the essay, but those are the main things I learned
2016-01-08 21:40:13	@indeedwatson	AlexJ44: did you watch Tangerine with english subs?
2016-01-08 21:40:20	AlexJ44	maybe I did
2016-01-08 21:40:22	AlexJ44	pribably so
2016-01-08 21:40:41	@indeedwatson	cause there's some armenian that im missing
2016-01-08 21:40:50	@indeedwatson	but i don't think it matters at this point
2016-01-08 21:41:59	AlexJ44	I don't think I got that either
2016-01-08 21:42:03	AlexJ44	but it doesnt matter much
2016-01-08 21:42:04	Digitalis2512	What was the first wuxia the Shaw Brothers did, wikipedia doesn't say
2016-01-08 21:42:21	AlexJ44	all the important stuff they discuss is in english, most of it must be armenian gibberish anyway
2016-01-08 21:42:57	@indeedwatson	i didn't understand how the wife found the taxi driver
2016-01-08 21:43:24	@indeedwatson	that's about the biggest detail i guess

2016-01-09 12:41:20	AlexJ44	i'm back - i'm done with MaM
2016-01-09 12:42:21	@indeedwatson	nice, i've only seen 1 ep :p
2016-01-09 12:44:23	AlexJ44	well
2016-01-09 12:44:32	AlexJ44	it's serial but with video
2016-01-09 12:44:46	@indeedwatson	to me it's the staircase 2.0
2016-01-09 12:44:49	AlexJ44	and features the same flaws serial and the jinx had
2016-01-09 12:45:10	AlexJ44	yes, I've heard of that one too, but I won't be watching it anytime soon, I'm done with stupid justice
2016-01-09 12:45:44	AlexJ44	have you seen the jinx though?
2016-01-09 12:45:59	@indeedwatson	i dont know how MoM goes but staircase actually follows the trail, which makes it quite compelling
2016-01-09 12:46:00	@indeedwatson	no
2016-01-09 12:46:41	@indeedwatson	i wonder what the first instance of these genre is
2016-01-09 12:46:55	@indeedwatson	maybe thin blue line
2016-01-09 12:47:06	@indeedwatson	which coincidentally had a Glass involved

2016-01-11 21:24:17	tomflint	get something near a good, cheap ethnic market, a butcher, and a decent farm market
2016-01-11 21:24:23	Carson-PHONE	Trying to find good quality with cheap rent
2016-01-11 21:24:28	Carson-PHONE	Balancing that
2016-01-11 21:24:38	Carson-PHONE	Lol indeed true
2016-01-11 21:24:42	tomflint	do you cook?
2016-01-11 21:24:50	Carson-PHONE	Yeah
2016-01-11 21:25:05	Carson-PHONE	But plan is to spend 50 dollars a week on food
2016-01-11 21:25:09	tomflint	haha
2016-01-11 21:25:11	Mothravka	Go vegan!
2016-01-11 21:25:14	tomflint	you'll crush that in no time
2016-01-11 21:25:32	tomflint	but yeah, a vegetarian diet is a good start. Also, learn to break down a chicken and you'll be set
2016-01-11 21:25:46	@indeedwatson	vegan protein is usually more expensive tho
2016-01-11 21:25:50	Carson-PHONE	Yeah I eat a lot of chicken/ eggs
2016-01-11 21:26:04	Carson-PHONE	With rice and beans
2016-01-11 21:26:15	Mothravka	indeedwatson: It's not.
2016-01-11 21:26:20	Mothravka	At least not if you know what to eat.
2016-01-11 21:26:42	tomflint	Carson-PHONE: the main thing is to find a good butcher, deli, ethic grocery shops, a farm market... etc. Go where the immigrants shop
2016-01-11 21:26:49	tomflint	you don't need pretty veg --
2016-01-11 21:27:00	tomflint	for me, I want the ugliest fruit and veg possible :)
2016-01-11 21:27:14	@indeedwatson	i dont know any vegetables that is cheap that has enough protein to fill my macros
2016-01-11 21:27:16	Carson-PHONE	Oh yeah a butcher, sounds a bit scary
2016-01-11 21:27:29	tomflint	nah, butchers are the best
2016-01-11 21:27:38	tomflint	better quality meat and cheaper than grocery stores
2016-01-11 21:27:46	Carson-PHONE	Will look
2016-01-11 21:27:53	tomflint	avoid the chains and cook everything from scratch. Also, rock a meal plan and you'll OWN your budget
2016-01-11 21:28:14	Carson-PHONE	Trader joes, whole foods?
2016-01-11 21:28:20	tomflint	yeah, skip those
2016-01-11 21:28:39	Mothravka	Strange that something should be considered "best" when it's about killing innocent animals.
2016-01-11 21:28:41	tomflint	trader joes is ok for some things -- but whole foods is crazy
2016-01-11 21:28:43	Carson-PHONE	Where do I buy good brown rice in bulk?
2016-01-11 21:28:53	tomflint	are animals innocent?
2016-01-11 21:28:56	Carson-PHONE	Whole foods is over priced
2016-01-11 21:29:00	tomflint	ethnic markets!
2016-01-11 21:29:08	@indeedwatson	plants are guilty
2016-01-11 21:29:11	Carson-PHONE	I'll look for some
2016-01-11 21:29:15	tomflint	I go to this italian deli / market -- its so cheap
2016-01-11 21:29:25	tomflint	I also do my veg shopping at a persian market
2016-01-11 21:29:54	Carson-PHONE	Animals are bad for the environment in the production system that we have
2016-01-11 21:30:07	Mothravka	Innocent until proven guilty!
2016-01-11 21:30:10	tomflint	and thats about it -- just cook everything and meal plan. If you can do that, you'll save so much time and money
2016-01-11 21:30:12	Carson-PHONE	Wouldn't go vegan though
2016-01-11 21:30:38	tomflint	nah, having a vegetarian diet for half of the week is good though
2016-01-11 21:30:51	Mothravka	Humans are the worst.
2016-01-11 21:31:06	@indeedwatson	Carson-PHONE: are you planning on working out tho
2016-01-11 21:31:09	tomflint	uh.. not really

2016-01-11 21:31:27	tomflint	we're neither
2016-01-11 21:31:33	Carson-PHONE	Yeah
2016-01-11 21:31:39	tomflint	we're predators with technology and community
2016-01-11 21:31:42	Card1974	Mothravka: nah, you just have to season them properly
2016-01-11 21:31:59	Carson-PHONE	I might get a gym membership
2016-01-11 21:32:07	@indeedwatson	and art!
2016-01-11 21:32:25	Carson-PHONE	But need to find a good one or my apartment complex might have one
2016-01-11 21:32:43	@indeedwatson	me too actually
2016-01-11 21:32:44	@indeedwatson	for legs
2016-01-11 21:32:46	tomflint	Carson-PHONE: another good way to save money with a gym membership is to treat the gym like another place to hangout. Get into one with a swimming pool and stuff
2016-01-11 21:33:03	@indeedwatson	or workout at home like me
2016-01-11 21:33:08	tomflint	just go and hangout even if you're not working out. Have a swim, do some towel snapping...

2016-01-11 21:37:25	Mothravka	He is pretty much forced to say what the police wants him to say.

2016-01-11 22:49:51	Mothravka	Damnation (1988) is amazing.
2016-01-11 22:50:50	RyanSmallwood	also, I haven't seen any of his films yet, but Bordwell recommended György Fehér's films for Tarr fans
2016-01-11 22:52:08	Mothravka	Hah! Me neither, but I was actually planning to watch Twilight (1990) by him tomorrow or later this week.
2016-01-11 22:52:42	RyanSmallwood	I'll try and see it soon, I have it downloaded, I'm just bad at getting around to watching things
2016-01-11 22:53:03	Mothravka	Tarr was a consultant on it too.
2016-01-11 22:53:19	Mothravka	I'm not bad at watching things, I just have too much to watch!
2016-01-11 22:53:24	RyanSmallwood	I think he was Tarr's producer or something, so there's a direct connection
2016-01-11 22:53:32	@indeedwatson	don't get confused and watch Twilight (2011)
2016-01-11 22:54:05	Mothravka	Because you did?
2016-01-11 22:54:26	@indeedwatson	no, i even got the year wrong now lol
2016-01-11 22:54:34	Mothravka	You suck!
2016-01-11 22:54:36	@indeedwatson	apparently the first film was in 2008
2016-01-11 22:56:38	RyanSmallwood	I got caught up in other projects, which distract me from watching as many movies as I used to
2016-01-11 22:56:43	@indeedwatson	ah, but you've already seen Twilight (2008)

2016-01-11 22:59:30	RyanSmallwood	I still fall back on Wittgenstein when I want to explain things
2016-01-11 23:00:04	@indeedwatson	i think that was the one i wanted to read
2016-01-11 23:00:08	@indeedwatson	should i try?
2016-01-11 23:01:08	RyanSmallwood	sure, its pretty accessible
2016-01-11 23:01:56	tomflint	do you guys want a copy of the book?
2016-01-11 23:02:06	RyanSmallwood	I guess it partially depends on your outlook going in though
2016-01-11 23:02:14	tomflint	there's also a guidebook to the book :)
2016-01-11 23:02:17	RyanSmallwood	for me Wittgenstein answered a lot of questions that were bothering

2016-01-11 23:02:34	RyanSmallwood	some people look at his stuff and wonder whats the point
2016-01-11 23:02:50	RyanSmallwood	..I don't think Wittgenstein needs a guidebook, but I guess its nice to have

2016-01-11 23:06:02	RyanSmallwood	even though he didn't call himself by the term, he was associated with Ordinary Language Philosophy, and his whole project was to throw out philosophical jargon and show that most philosophical problems were just confusion about how language works

2016-01-13 18:14:45	RyanSmallwood	*attack on theory called Post-Theory
2016-01-13 18:15:00	Porkepik	Ok, I've heard of him in a video yesterday
2016-01-13 18:15:09	RyanSmallwood	what was the video on?
2016-01-13 18:15:17	RyanSmallwood	and how was he mentioned?
2016-01-13 18:15:47	Porkepik	It's the guy who did Crossed, he started his new show and his first video talks about Troll 2
2016-01-13 18:16:03	@indeedwatson	link
2016-01-13 18:16:09	Porkepik	At the end, he starts asking questions like "What's a bad movie ?" and because of that, What's a good one ? And actually what's a movie ?
2016-01-13 18:16:37	Porkepik	Then he starts talking about a writer that he doesn't agree with "Noel Carrel" in this case and his book ... (looking for it now)
2016-01-13 18:17:10	Porkepik	"The Philosophy of Motion Pictures"

2016-01-13 18:17:47	@indeedwatson	nvm
2016-01-13 18:19:06	Porkepik	Apparently Noel Carrol said that the appreciation of a movie depends on "categories"
2016-01-13 18:19:15	Porkepik	But the guy in the video doesn't agree with that and explain later
2016-01-13 18:19:28	Porkepik	Saying that it's too "blurry"
2016-01-13 18:20:35	Porkepik	Saying for example that a lot of things can be called categories, "horror" or simply, as we call them in France, "nanars" (movies so bad they're fun)
2016-01-13 18:20:49	RyanSmallwood	hard to say without reading the book, but I'd imagine his argument is more complex than that
2016-01-13 18:20:54	Porkepik	And in the example of Troll 2, while the movie is bad as a horror film, he is good at being a nanar
2016-01-13 18:21:18	Porkepik	Well, he says "He concludes in his book by saying ..."
2016-01-13 18:21:53	Porkepik	So I don't know, I also haven't read it and just heard about him in this video where he specify he doesn't agree with the guy and didn't like the book

2016-01-13 18:34:55	@indeedwatson	why not vimeo tho
2016-01-13 18:35:07	@indeedwatson	it's like using photobucket instead of imgur

2016-01-13 18:36:41	Porkepik	But I live in a country that has a big web industry, so people tend to use the french version of websites

2016-01-13 18:37:41	AlexJ44	in portugal, since most portugese websites are utter crap, we rely on big websites like imdb, youtube, etc
2016-01-13 18:37:51	Porkepik	Well, not weird, our websites aren't that bad
2016-01-13 18:38:02	Porkepik	Allociné is shit tho, dailymotion isn't always very pratical
2016-01-13 18:38:16	@indeedwatson	it is weird to me to got to sites with less exposure
2016-01-13 18:38:20	Porkepik	But you have a lot of examples where people gave up on the american websites to choose the french copycat
2016-01-13 18:38:52	@indeedwatson	especially something like kickstarter, where it's about crowfunding, you want a bigger crowd by definition
2016-01-13 18:39:01	Porkepik	"it is weird to me to got to sites with less exposure" So it's weird to watch less known movies ?
2016-01-13 18:39:05	Porkepik	To go to less known places ?
2016-01-13 18:39:09	Porkepik	To eat less known food ?
2016-01-13 18:39:26	Porkepik	I guess it's cause unusual != weird, to me
2016-01-13 18:39:56	Porkepik	Except on Ulule people usually sell projects that are exclusive to french people
2016-01-13 18:40:15	Porkepik	Why would a french show go to kickstarter to sell it when they are just looking for french speaking people ?
2016-01-13 18:40:46	@indeedwatson	because you go to kickstarter to get money
2016-01-13 18:40:56	@indeedwatson	and there's no such thing as less known money
2016-01-13 18:41:17	Porkepik	And you go to Ulule to get money, when your targeted public is exclusivly french
2016-01-13 18:41:26	AlexJ44	yeah, that one makes sense
2016-01-13 18:41:37	AlexJ44	not so much about using daily motion, unless your target is exclusively french
2016-01-13 18:41:45	@indeedwatson	i guess i don't understand why excluding people :p
2016-01-13 18:41:48	AlexJ44	I can relate to that, because I prefer to do my show in portuguese instead of english
2016-01-13 18:42:06	Porkepik	Why excluding people ? Do you speak french ? No, in this case you are kinda excluded to watch Chroma
2016-01-13 18:42:13	Porkepik	What did you say after i linked it ? =
2016-01-13 18:42:21	Porkepik	[22:17] <@indeedwatson> oh
2016-01-13 18:42:21	Porkepik	[22:17] <@indeedwatson> nvm
2016-01-13 18:42:36	Porkepik	You gave up on watching it, like you would have gave up on funding the project cause it's in french
2016-01-13 18:42:38	@indeedwatson	the internet is basically in english
2016-01-13 18:42:49	Porkepik	The internet doesn't have a langauge
2016-01-13 18:42:59	Porkepik	It is mainly in english, it seems
2016-01-13 18:43:07	@indeedwatson	i think it's unrealistic to say that
2016-01-13 18:43:11	Porkepik	But it doesn't exclude people from creating language specific communities
2016-01-13 18:43:41	@indeedwatson	it's the reason we 3, with 3 different languages, can speak to each other in a 4th
2016-01-13 18:44:31	Porkepik	Yeah ok, but I don't see how that's changing what i said earlier
2016-01-13 18:44:34	Porkepik	Chroma is in french
2016-01-13 18:44:52	Porkepik	Ulule allows french projects to get more exposure (cause the databse is mainly french)
2016-01-13 18:45:01	AlexJ44	like I get both points, it would make sense to have a centralised video community on youtube, but I can also see why daily motion is popular in france
2016-01-13 18:45:26	RyanSmallwood	Porkepik: I don't necessarily 100% agree with Carrol, but I think his interpretation of Carrol's theory is very unfair
2016-01-13 18:45:31	RyanSmallwood	"Admittedly, the pluralistic-category approach will not dissolve every
2016-01-13 18:45:31	RyanSmallwood	disagreement about motion picture evaluation. Even if the correct category
2016-01-13 18:45:31	RyanSmallwood	is identified, there may be debates about how to apply it — disputes, for
2016-01-13 18:45:31	RyanSmallwood	example, about how a given movie fits the category or categories in
2016-01-13 18:45:31	RyanSmallwood	question; disagreements about how to weigh the different standards that
2016-01-13 18:45:31	RyanSmallwood	may be pertinent to the category or categories at issue, and debates about
2016-01-13 18:45:32	RyanSmallwood	their underlying purposes. Perhaps most often, these controversies need to
2016-01-13 18:45:32	RyanSmallwood	be worked out on a case-by-case basis (which is not to say that they cannot
2016-01-13 18:45:33	RyanSmallwood	frequently be resolved objectively)."
2016-01-13 18:45:55	RyanSmallwood	"Maybe sometimes, even often, it is silly, or imponderable, or both to try to
2016-01-13 18:45:55	RyanSmallwood	evaluate comparatively certain works of radically disjoint and virtually
2016-01-13 18:45:55	RyanSmallwood	incommensurable categories. Nevertheless, it is not always silly to do so.
2016-01-13 18:45:55	RyanSmallwood	Aren't there cases where we are willing to indulge in this sort of comparison
2016-01-13 18:45:55	RyanSmallwood	with great confidence? Does anyone feel squeamish in asserting
2016-01-13 18:45:55	RyanSmallwood	that Tokyo Story is a better film than The Big Broadcast of 1938 or that Father
2016-01-13 18:45:56	RyanSmallwood	Panchali is superior to Glen or Glenda? However, these are not the sort
2016-01-13 18:45:56	RyanSmallwood	of evaluations that the pluralistic-categorical approach is well suited to
2016-01-13 18:45:57	RyanSmallwood	advance, since it seems fruitless to attempt to situate either of the
2016-01-13 18:45:57	RyanSmallwood	preceding pairs of motion pictures informatively in the same category or
2016-01-13 18:45:58	RyanSmallwood	categories."
2016-01-13 18:47:06	Porkepik	Oh ok, thanks for the quote
2016-01-13 18:49:01	Porkepik	Yeah he still seem to approach his theory carefully
2016-01-13 18:49:28	Porkepik	I guess the guy was kinda bitter and didn't really understand fully what he was trying to convey
2016-01-13 18:50:49	Porkepik	Oh also one last thing with Dailymotion : Compare to Youtube, they don't really deal with copyrights
2016-01-13 18:51:08	Porkepik	So Chroma is featuring a lot of movie footages that already got their youtube videos deleted
2016-01-13 18:51:54	Porkepik	On Dailymotion they are safe
2016-01-13 18:52:47	Porkepik	(Since Dailymotion is less famous and french, they are protected of the pressure from big studios)

2016-01-13 19:36:54	@indeedwatson	i have a better idea

2016-01-13 19:37:33	RyanSmallwood	if that motivates you, I would just try to get more enthusiastic about long films
2016-01-13 19:38:15	@indeedwatson	or... go all the way and watch a miniseries 
2016-01-13 19:38:34	Porkepikk	Yeah, I don't know if that's the right way to go, right now I'm having more fun watching per deacades

2016-01-13 19:44:48	Porkepikk	Yeah
2016-01-13 19:45:14	RyanSmallwood	yeah he was like the most innovative filmmaker of the silent era until his career sunk with Napoleon
2016-01-13 19:45:17	Porkepikk	He lived a long life and like most silent filmmakers, I remember reading he went broke

2016-01-13 20:57:59	AlexJ44	some versions are cut 10 minutes short because of that. it's some difference between pal and ntsc or whatever
2016-01-13 20:58:03	Porkepik	The beep scared me D:
2016-01-13 20:58:14	RyanSmallwood	well I am Twenty was censored on release, so there is a censored cut floating out there
2016-01-13 20:58:28	Porkepik	Ok thanks Alex, i checked and all the dvds version i found are 164 mins long
2016-01-13 20:58:38	Porkepik	So i guess that's this one
2016-01-13 20:58:58	Porkepik	Anyway, going back at it, gotta find a way to mute IRC tho
2016-01-13 20:59:02	Card1974	PAL has usually a 4% speedup
2016-01-13 20:59:20	Porkepik	Ok thanks
2016-01-13 20:59:38	Porkepik	It's cause it's 24 instead of 23.976 ?

2016-01-13 21:00:09	Porkepik	Ok no it's 25, the change would be too small
2016-01-13 21:00:11	AlexJ44	I didn't believe it when I heard about it
2016-01-13 21:00:43	AlexJ44	but you get one less second per 25 seconds I think, so roughly 2 per minute
2016-01-13 21:01:07	AlexJ44	well, the math doesn't really add up
2016-01-13 21:01:26	AlexJ44	maybe I should brush my second grade arithmetics before going on to algebra
2016-01-13 21:01:41	Card1974	read the article, it explains everything you would ever want to know about the speeds

2016-01-14 11:41:59	Mothravka	"We supposedly call cinema the seventh art. I don't think cinema deserves to be called the seventh art. It's far too young and immature. And okay, we don't have to worry about it anymore, because it's dead anyway."
2016-01-14 11:42:10	Mothravka	Greenaway is the fucking best!
2016-01-14 11:42:33	@indeedwatson	is he like a troll

2016-01-14 11:49:55	Mothravka	But if one wants some weight to what Greenaway is talking about, I recommend his sort of "lecture" called The Cinema is Dead, Long Live the Cinema.
2016-01-14 11:50:41	Mothravka	A bit long, but totally worth it if one is interesting in film theory.
2016-01-14 11:51:00	Mothravka	He's funny as hell too.
2016-01-14 11:51:04	thewillmatic__	I can’t see The Martian winning Best pic
2016-01-14 11:51:23	Mothravka	I can't see why one should care.

2016-01-14 11:52:21	thewillmatic__	i care a little bit. it doesn’t matter much but its fun to debate imo
2016-01-14 11:53:13	Mothravka	As always, Godard said it before and I'll qoute him again: "If movie makers were building airplanes, there would be an accident every time one took off. But in the movies, these accidents are called Oscars."
2016-01-14 11:53:33	@indeedwatson	lol
2016-01-14 11:54:21	@indeedwatson	Mothravka: it's odd to me about this video seeing a film maker talking so much about his own film
2016-01-14 11:54:39	Mothravka	What's so odd about that?
2016-01-14 11:55:31	@indeedwatson	I rarely see that, I'm used to Kubrick or Tarkovsky being all secretive about their own films
2016-01-14 11:55:45	Mothravka	Oh, you mean that way.
2016-01-14 11:55:56	@indeedwatson	yeah
2016-01-14 11:56:20	Mothravka	We'll, he's talking a lot about cinema in general too, so I guess that's why.
2016-01-14 12:00:05	@indeedwatson	i think it's a bit silly to call it young based only on age
2016-01-14 12:07:35	Mothravka	"I don't think we've seen any cinema yet. I think we've seen 100 years of illustrated text."

2016-01-14 21:50:12	Porkepik_	Thanks
2016-01-14 21:50:25	@indeedwatson	you haven't seen it??
2016-01-14 22:07:38	Mothravka	Tacos!
2016-01-14 22:07:53	@indeedwatson	Empanadas!
2016-01-14 22:08:54	RyanSmallwood	I hope Mad Max wins all the oscars
2016-01-14 22:09:15	@indeedwatson	wish i could rewatch it on big screen
2016-01-14 22:09:33	RyanSmallwood	though I still have to see The Revenant, which looks like the biggest competitor
2016-01-14 22:10:11	@indeedwatson	yeah i'll watch it when it comes out here
2016-01-14 22:10:14	@indeedwatson	same with h8
2016-01-14 22:10:41	RyanSmallwood	I saw The Eightful Hate!
2016-01-14 22:10:56	@indeedwatson	did you like it
2016-01-14 22:11:50	RyanSmallwood	Yeah I thought it was very well made. It is not always the most pleasant movie to watch though.
2016-01-14 22:12:12	RyanSmallwood	the Morricone score is wonderful
2016-01-14 22:12:14	@indeedwatson	i don't mind that
2016-01-14 22:12:29	@indeedwatson	how would you rank it among other tarantino films
2016-01-14 22:15:16	RyanSmallwood	hmmmm
2016-01-14 22:15:38	RyanSmallwood	under my favorites Kill Bill and Jackie Brown
2016-01-14 22:15:50	@indeedwatson	nice
2016-01-14 22:16:23	RyanSmallwood	maybe under pulp fiction too, but its been a while
2016-01-14 22:16:48	RyanSmallwood	I like it better than IB and Django though
2016-01-14 22:17:04	@indeedwatson	that is what i hope
2016-01-14 22:18:30	RyanSmallwood	I may try and see it in theaters a second time if they keep it playing
2016-01-14 22:19:01	@indeedwatson	i also need to see carol
2016-01-14 22:19:04	@indeedwatson	and anomalisa
2016-01-14 22:19:07	@indeedwatson	in february
2016-01-14 22:20:27	Mothravka	I need to see Cemetery of Splendour (2015).
2016-01-14 22:20:31	RyanSmallwood	There's a lot of more interesting less popular stuff I never got around to seeing
2016-01-14 22:21:14	@indeedwatson	yes but they won't reach theaters here probably, i'll have to download those when they're available

2016-01-14 22:23:26	@indeedwatson	like netflix?
2016-01-14 22:24:06	RyanSmallwood	I think The Revenant is actually going to be my first Iñárritu flick, I hope its good
2016-01-14 22:24:10	Mothravka	I don't know, The Internet is big. Netflix seems quite bad overall though.
2016-01-14 22:24:30	@indeedwatson	RyanSmallwood: really??
2016-01-14 22:24:56	RyanSmallwood	yeah, I've been lazy, and his last few I've heard about had really divided opinions
2016-01-14 22:25:29	RyanSmallwood	I kind of wanted to see Birdman, but then I never got around to it
2016-01-14 22:25:50	@indeedwatson	I saw Amores Perros way too long ago, but i recall liking 21 grams and babel, did not like biutiful, and loved birdman

2016-01-15 22:20:29	RyanSmallwood	should I try to watch all of the ones made by the bigger cantonese studios?
2016-01-15 22:20:42	RyanSmallwood	or is it okay to just pick a selection?
2016-01-15 22:20:56	Mothravka	You should try to watch... EVERYTHING1

2016-01-16 11:14:45	Carson-PHONE	Morning
2016-01-16 11:15:06	Mothravka	Good morning.
2016-01-16 11:15:21	Carson-PHONE	Just realized eating a healthy diet is about quality and quantity
2016-01-16 11:15:25	Porkepikk	Good european afternoon
2016-01-16 11:15:34	Carson-PHONE	Not about calories and fat
2016-01-16 11:16:00	Porkepikk	Well, it's a little bit of all
2016-01-16 11:16:09	Carson-PHONE	Foods should be ranked in different tiers of quality
2016-01-16 11:16:10	Porkepikk	Also, working your body helps
2016-01-16 11:16:28	@indeedwatson	fat is just one macro nutrient
2016-01-16 11:16:55	Carson-PHONE	Low sugar is really important to me
2016-01-16 11:17:16	@indeedwatson	what diet is about depends mostly on your goals
2016-01-16 11:17:25	Carson-PHONE	Also don't buy food products but buy real food without packaging
2016-01-16 11:17:46	Carson-PHONE	Not always true but close
2016-01-16 11:18:21	@indeedwatson	if that works for you ye
2016-01-16 11:18:56	Carson-PHONE	Just watched a short video about American diets
2016-01-16 11:19:53	@indeedwatson	was it samsara
2016-01-16 11:20:13	Carson-PHONE	Also haven't had soda regularly for the last 10 years
2016-01-16 11:20:39	Carson-PHONE	Grew up with it and didn't think anything of it because it was yummy
2016-01-16 11:20:53	zxc	never been a fan
2016-01-16 11:20:56	zxc	water only for me!
2016-01-16 11:21:09	@indeedwatson	yeah liquid calories is one of the first things to drop if you want to lose weight
2016-01-16 11:21:26	Carson-PHONE	Yeah also just general health
2016-01-16 11:21:54	@indeedwatson	general health is a very vague term tho
2016-01-16 11:22:10	Carson-PHONE	Soda is addicting been trying to ween my gf off of it the past few years
2016-01-16 11:22:25	Carson-PHONE	Yeah not sure what I mean by general lol
2016-01-16 11:22:38	Carson-PHONE	Meaning like diabetes, organ health
2016-01-16 11:22:52	Carson-PHONE	Blood pressure
2016-01-16 11:23:12	Carson-PHONE	Not really sure about the specifics
2016-01-16 11:24:14	Carson-PHONE	I'm not worried about losing weight, but I pick foods that are good for my nutrition, organ health
2016-01-16 11:24:51	Carson-PHONE	People always say I can eat whatever I want, You're skinny
2016-01-16 11:25:18	Carson-PHONE	Does this make sense?
2016-01-16 11:25:21	@indeedwatson	well if you don't workout you'll just get skinny fat and then fat
2016-01-16 11:25:31	Carson-PHONE	Yep
2016-01-16 11:25:53	@indeedwatson	but if you workout and you need to eat a surplus it can be pretty difficult
2016-01-16 11:26:07	Carson-PHONE	Yep
2016-01-16 11:26:33	Carson-PHONE	That's my typical challenge
2016-01-16 11:27:03	@indeedwatson	there's a dude in a fitness channel that's 190cm and 67kg
2016-01-16 11:27:10	Carson-PHONE	But my environment is changing for the better now
2016-01-16 11:27:30	@indeedwatson	i think he started at around 60kg
2016-01-16 11:27:43	Carson-PHONE	Will be on my own again, and will have more cash
2016-01-16 11:28:02	@indeedwatson	yeah it really helps when you can control what's around the house to eat
2016-01-16 11:28:04	Carson-PHONE	Indeed I don't know metric in comparison 😞
2016-01-16 11:28:38	Carson-PHONE	Can you convert that to lbs- pounds
2016-01-16 11:29:01	@indeedwatson	6'2"
2016-01-16 11:29:07	@indeedwatson	148lbs
2016-01-16 11:29:10	Carson-PHONE	Sorry I'm on phone
2016-01-16 11:29:36	Carson-PHONE	I'm 6' and around 150 lbs
2016-01-16 11:29:39	@indeedwatson	he started at 127lbs
2016-01-16 11:30:43	Carson-PHONE	Trying to figure out what's best to eat at work
2016-01-16 11:30:56	@indeedwatson	peanuts!
2016-01-16 11:32:09	Porkepikk	Giants :O
2016-01-16 11:32:17	Porkepikk	I'm 5'5"
2016-01-16 11:32:33	@indeedwatson	i'm 5'10"
2016-01-16 11:32:42	Carson-PHONE	I feel short at 6
2016-01-16 11:33:21	Carson-PHONE	Porkepikk: sorry to bother, any updates on video essay?
2016-01-16 11:33:41	Porkepikk	Gave up on it
2016-01-16 11:33:49	Porkepikk	It was the best idea :X
2016-01-16 11:34:08	@indeedwatson	what's your weight Porkepikk 
2016-01-16 11:34:16	Porkepikk	I dunno exactly
2016-01-16 11:34:27	Porkepikk	That's been a while I weight myseld
2016-01-16 11:34:40	Mothravka	Porkepikk: Did you like Marketa Lazarová (1967)?
2016-01-16 11:35:02	Porkepikk	OMG SO MUCH
2016-01-16 11:35:13	Porkepikk	One of my new fav of all time as of now
2016-01-16 11:35:16	Mothravka	Nice!
2016-01-16 11:35:44	Mothravka	I think I'll rewatch it soon on Blu-ray, because my girlfriend hasn't seen it yet.
2016-01-16 11:36:43	Porkepikk	I was so much into it, I love how "poetic" it is at some points
2016-01-16 11:37:00	Mothravka	Check out this one too: http://letterboxd.com/film/the-valley-of-the-bees/
2016-01-16 11:37:01		[ http://is.gd/7bhwsq ]
2016-01-16 11:37:10	Mothravka	It's by the same director and also set around the same time.
2016-01-16 11:37:13	Carson-PHONE	I saw M Laz a few years ago
2016-01-16 11:37:16	Porkepikk	And it was so much well made, how the fuck did they shoot it ? The condition seemed so tough
2016-01-16 11:37:23	zxc	I was 55kg / 182cm but now 62kg :)
2016-01-16 11:37:49	Carson-PHONE	Pork do you have a rough draft that I could look at?
2016-01-16 11:38:10	@indeedwatson	gj zxc
2016-01-16 11:38:24	@indeedwatson	i like how easy your nick is to type
2016-01-16 11:38:31	zxc	:)
2016-01-16 11:38:32	Carson-PHONE	Or any progress, just curious because I want to learn
2016-01-16 11:38:45	zxc	it wasn't through exercise though, I am not sure how I put that on
2016-01-16 11:38:49	zxc	I guess I just ate more
2016-01-16 11:39:11	@indeedwatson	yes that's how you gain weight
2016-01-16 11:39:25	@indeedwatson	resistance training just means it'll be put on as muscle
2016-01-16 11:39:31	zxc	often I am hungry but don't feel like eating... it's a bit weird
2016-01-16 11:39:33	Porkepikk	Not amymore but it was something like introductions of a few scenes and what bothered me about them then talking about the movie more globally and arguing with the filmmaking choices
2016-01-16 11:40:19	@indeedwatson	im about to finish jj

2016-01-16 12:01:36	RyanSmallwood	dammit Mothravka beat me to the Porkepikk interrogation on Marketa Lazarová
2016-01-16 12:01:45	Mothravka	Heh.
2016-01-16 12:02:25	Porkepikk	He is my new master :O
2016-01-16 12:02:34	@indeedwatson	kinky
2016-01-16 12:03:49	RyanSmallwood	seriously, I'm 131/250 on his top 250, I've got some catching up to do
2016-01-16 12:05:09	Porkepikk	Yeah but hey ... Who has watch almost all the HK 1965 films ??!
2016-01-16 12:05:21	RyanSmallwood	not me
2016-01-16 12:05:22	Porkepikk	Just put them all in your top 250 !
2016-01-16 12:05:34	RyanSmallwood	I've watched maybe 1/10th or 1/5th of HK 1965 films
2016-01-16 12:06:09	Mothravka	I've only watched around 50 HK films in total. So I have some catching up to do elsewhere as well.
2016-01-16 12:08:05	Porkepikk	Anyway, only 2 films left on the list, that mean I will have finish the list in maybe 2 weeks !
2016-01-16 12:08:29	@indeedwatson	those must be some really long films
2016-01-16 12:08:37	Porkepikk	Cause you have to take into account the days I'm like "I'm gonna watch that today !" And the  I give up on i
2016-01-16 12:09:50	@indeedwatson	why do you give up
2016-01-16 12:11:02	Porkepikk	Cause I take too much time to start watching it
2016-01-16 12:11:14	@indeedwatson	how
2016-01-16 12:11:16	Porkepikk	And it's too late when I want to so it
2016-01-16 12:11:20	Mothravka	Hard to make up your mind about what to watch, you mean?
2016-01-16 12:11:42	@indeedwatson	oh i have that problem too
2016-01-16 12:11:55	Mothravka	I always have it. Almost. Hah.
2016-01-16 12:12:09	@indeedwatson	luckly the first movies in my list are short
2016-01-16 12:12:16	Porkepikk	Well, at least, while I took way longer than I thought to finish Ryan first list I'm proud that I can keep up a good pace and still so much interested in it
2016-01-16 12:12:37	Porkepikk	The end of the list is actually so good, I think I prefer it overall than the beginning
2016-01-16 12:13:12	Mothravka	I have like over 100 different watchlists that I usually go after. Not easy.
2016-01-16 12:13:19	Porkepikk	I watched some other stuffs also, so my goal of at least 300 movies this year is looking goos
2016-01-16 12:13:31	Carson-PHONE	Just realized Under the Skin is the sequel to Ex Machina
2016-01-16 12:13:36	Carson-PHONE	Not really though
2016-01-16 12:13:41	@indeedwatson	i haven't seen ex machina
2016-01-16 12:13:52	@indeedwatson	i had no interest but i think i kinda want to
2016-01-16 12:13:53	Porkepikk	I haven't seen Under The Skin
2016-01-16 12:14:08	Carson-PHONE	I like under the skin more
2016-01-16 12:14:14	Carson-PHONE	But they are very similar
2016-01-16 12:14:32	RyanSmallwood	Under The Skin was really good
2016-01-16 12:14:57	@indeedwatson	yeah
2016-01-16 12:15:26	Carson-PHONE	I want to go see the revenant in theaters soon
2016-01-16 12:15:38	RyanSmallwood	its good!
2016-01-16 12:15:41	@indeedwatson	i'll go after h8
2016-01-16 12:15:48	@indeedwatson	and then carol and anomalisa next month
2016-01-16 12:15:54	Mothravka	I want to see Eros Plus Massacre (1969) at the cinema soon.
2016-01-16 12:16:04	RyanSmallwood	is it going to be playing near you?
2016-01-16 12:16:08	Mothravka	No.
2016-01-16 12:16:12	Mothravka	Probably never. Heh.
2016-01-16 12:16:18	RyanSmallwood	:/ goodluck
2016-01-16 12:17:40	@indeedwatson	i wish i could see lawrence of arabia and 2001 in cinema
2016-01-16 12:17:47	@indeedwatson	but probably won't happen either
2016-01-16 12:18:10	@indeedwatson	2001 MAYBE if I'm lucky
2016-01-16 12:18:14	Mothravka	Bigger chance than Eros Plus Massacre (1969) at least.
2016-01-16 12:18:33	@indeedwatson	ye
2016-01-16 12:23:07	RyanSmallwood	I got to see a 70mm print of 2001 :)
2016-01-16 12:23:30	@indeedwatson	:(
2016-01-16 12:23:35	Porkepikk	I need to watch it too
2016-01-16 12:24:04	Mothravka	I saw Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999) on the big screen. Suck on that!
2016-01-16 12:24:17	@indeedwatson	wow me too!
2016-01-16 12:24:24	@indeedwatson	and probably ep 2 too
2016-01-16 12:24:25	Porkepikk	So I got to hype Eros + Massacre if Mothravka loves it so much
2016-01-16 12:24:28	Mothravka	High five!
2016-01-16 12:24:32	@indeedwatson	o/
2016-01-16 12:24:59	Porkepikk	I have it on DVD btw
2016-01-16 12:25:15	Porkepikk	Blind purchase like Jancso box
2016-01-16 12:25:21	Porkepikk	But it was cheap
2016-01-16 12:25:37	@indeedwatson	i don't even have a dvd drive
2016-01-16 12:25:52	Porkepikk	(Talking about E+M not Star wars obviously)
2016-01-16 12:26:13	@indeedwatson	eros + massacre special george lucas edit
2016-01-16 12:26:38	RyanSmallwood	:D :D :D
2016-01-16 12:26:45	Porkepikk	Who shot first ? D:
2016-01-16 12:27:02	Mothravka	Porkepikk: Yes! It can be worth to read a bit about Sakae Ôsugi a quickie before venturing into the movie though, just a heads up.
2016-01-16 12:27:11	Mothravka	Which DVD version do you have?
2016-01-16 12:27:13	RyanSmallwood	I can just imagine, perfectly symmetrical black and white shot composition, giant CGI alien dinosaur walks through foreground
2016-01-16 12:27:20	Porkepikk	Ok
2016-01-16 12:27:21	@indeedwatson	hahah
2016-01-16 12:27:48	@indeedwatson	anarchists discussing philosophy, jarjar trips on an apple
2016-01-16 12:27:56	Porkepikk	Well i have the long version but then it's a french dvd release
2016-01-16 12:28:01	Mothravka	Oh.
2016-01-16 12:28:12	Mothravka	http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/KijA-Yoshida-Love-and-Anarchism-Blu-ray/133365/
2016-01-16 12:28:13		[ http://is.gd/64no2u ]
2016-01-16 12:28:16	@indeedwatson	there's a shirt version?
2016-01-16 12:28:17	Mothravka	I have that one. So nice set.
2016-01-16 12:28:18	@indeedwatson	short
2016-01-16 12:28:22	Mothravka	Yeah.
2016-01-16 12:28:30	@indeedwatson	how short?
2016-01-16 12:28:49	Porkepikk	Will buy a Bluray when i have one
2016-01-16 12:29:08	Mothravka	The short version should be around 165 minutes.
2016-01-16 12:29:15	Mothravka	The longer one is a bit over 200 minutes.
2016-01-16 12:29:29	Porkepikk	209 I think
2016-01-16 12:29:39	@indeedwatson	i watched the long one

2016-01-16 12:29:55	Mothravka	Yeah, I've seen the long one two times.
2016-01-16 12:30:20	@indeedwatson	I might see it again if there's ever a brrip
2016-01-16 12:30:37	Mothravka	Hope there's not.
2016-01-16 12:30:43	Mothravka	Heh.

2016-01-16 12:33:23	Mothravka	In my opinion, one of the best Japanese movies of all time. Very underseen.
2016-01-16 12:34:05	Mothravka	And that soundtrack!

2016-01-16 12:35:31	Mothravka	Which list?
2016-01-16 12:35:42	Mothravka	Anyways, yes. 100 is a good and even number.

2016-01-16 13:28:12	RyanSmallwood	yeah, each episode was released in theaters on its own
2016-01-16 13:28:20	RyanSmallwood	in fact I think its more fun if you restrict yourself to no more than 1 episode a day
2016-01-16 13:28:29	Porkepik_	Ok cool, like a mini serie :D
2016-01-16 13:28:36	Porkepik_	Should start today then

2016-01-16 13:29:32	Porkepik_	I think I'm gonna watch some american movies at the same time, like Griffith (did I say it right this time ?)

2016-01-16 13:50:33	Mothravka	And shove it in everybody's face and show off with my money that I really haven't got.
2016-01-16 14:00:17	@indeedwatson	wow RyanSmallwood did it, convinced Porkepik_ to watch a series
2016-01-16 14:01:20	@indeedwatson	i have a wallet that has the Lost numbers and dharma logo
2016-01-16 14:01:24	@indeedwatson	you can guess how old it is
2016-01-16 14:02:38	Mothravka	Okay, I'll start. 6 years old?
2016-01-16 14:02:59	@indeedwatson	i don't know!
2016-01-16 14:03:02	@indeedwatson	it was a trick question
2016-01-16 14:03:42	@indeedwatson	because it is older than Lost, it used to be a RHCP wallet, and then i bought those logos made in fabric and sew them on the wallet
2016-01-16 14:05:07	Mothravka	You can make a wallet out of your favourite pillow.
2016-01-16 14:05:17	Mothravka	I think you should do that, it sounds great.
2016-01-16 14:05:21	@indeedwatson	but how will i sleep
2016-01-16 14:05:38	Mothravka	On the bed.
2016-01-16 14:05:56	Mothravka	Take your second favourite pillow then.
2016-01-16 14:06:07	@indeedwatson	i use 2 pillows to sleep
2016-01-16 14:06:14	@indeedwatson	one for my head, one for hug
2016-01-16 14:06:21	Mothravka	How cute.
2016-01-16 14:06:28	Mothravka	Then don't make your own wallet!
2016-01-16 14:07:25	Porkepik_	You have a body pillow ? :D
2016-01-16 14:09:06	Mothravka	Probably a substitute for Monica Vitti.

2016-01-16 14:40:48	Mothravka	Oh.

2016-01-16 14:40:59	Mothravka	Hopefully.
2016-01-16 14:41:16	@indeedwatson	El Secreto de sus Ojos was good
2016-01-16 14:41:21	@indeedwatson	i think it got an american remake
2016-01-16 14:44:31	Mothravka	I wasn't that impressed with the movie.
2016-01-16 14:44:58	Mothravka	Yeah, I heard something about a remake.
2016-01-16 15:05:30	RyanSmallwood	I don't know anything about modern Argentine cinema, but I've heard Leopoldo Torre Nilsson is the name to checkout for older arthouse cinema
2016-01-16 15:06:49	Mothravka	Yeah, I know about him. Have some of his movies on my "Argentine cinema" watchlist.

2016-01-17 11:08:26	RyanSmallwood	that's going to be the weird part of my HK project, all the major studios start making porn in the 70s...
2016-01-17 11:08:43	@indeedwatson	major studios? really?
2016-01-17 11:09:03	RyanSmallwood	yup, sometimes with big actors in supporting roles (not in the sex scenes though)
2016-01-17 11:09:22	@indeedwatson	interesting
2016-01-17 11:09:29	@indeedwatson	i guess they have a less taboo view on sex?
2016-01-17 11:11:11	RyanSmallwood	I dunno if its necessarily less taboo, but I guess more accepting of porn existing
2016-01-17 11:11:28	RyanSmallwood	very few actors want to go into "Category 3" aka erotic films, because it might ruin their career
2016-01-17 11:11:37	RyanSmallwood	and lot of films bring in Japanese actresses for the sex scenes
2016-01-17 11:11:51	RyanSmallwood	its like they're okay with the porn, but more actors would still be stigmatized if they did it
2016-01-17 11:11:56	RyanSmallwood	its weird
2016-01-17 11:12:17	Mothravka	They should bring in indeedwatson with his dakimakura.

2016-01-17 12:42:40	Mothravka	I prefer black metal like Teitanblood, Bathory (first album), Black Witchery, Proclamation, Blasphemy, Apokalyptic Raids, Wrathprayer, Bone Awl, Revenge, Tatanhammer, Milumet etc. Just to take some examples of what I listened to lately.
2016-01-17 12:44:15	Mothravka	I have a weak spot for early raw BM, really punky, raw, noisy and dirty BM, death/black metal hybrids à la Teitanblood and such.
2016-01-17 12:45:01	@indeedwatson	i think metal is one of the few genres i just can't like aesthetically

2016-01-17 12:49:07	@indeedwatson	i get tired of guitars with high distortion very quickly

2016-01-17 13:03:19	Mothravka	I am a bit split on that. I am a sucker for metal with a lot of (good) distortion, and I listen to a lot of industrial/noise that probably even has more distortion, same with punk, but I like electronic music that doesn't have a lot of it too, like ambient and more experimental stuff.
2016-01-17 13:04:05	Porkepik	Yeah, to each their own, music is way more relying on taste
2016-01-17 13:04:07	zxc	I quite like clean and crisp sound including in metal
2016-01-17 13:04:30	Porkepik	Compare to movies, I notice a big gap in taste
2016-01-17 13:04:37	Mothravka	I can't stand that when it comes to metal almost, hah.

2016-01-17 13:05:52	zxc	definitely heard some tracks before

2016-01-18 21:04:33	RyanSmallwood	Crash Course is starting a philosophy series. Probably won't have enough time to go very in depth, but it should be fun to watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNYJQaZUDrI
2016-01-18 21:04:34		[ http://is.gd/A8dxfM ]
2016-01-18 21:04:52	RyanSmallwood	I fell behind on Crash Course series, really want to watch the economics and psychology ones eventually
2016-01-18 21:11:54	@indeedwatson	i was watching the history one
2016-01-18 21:13:03	thewillmatic__	ah that guy is awesome he helped me with my chemistry XD
2016-01-18 21:13:18	RyanSmallwood	I watched the history ones when it was starting, but I fell off after they started adding new series
2016-01-18 21:14:09	RyanSmallwood	I'm mostly just curious for philosophy if he'll favor analytic or continental philosophy, or try to cover both
2016-01-18 21:16:59	thewillmatic__	tonight im watching Mesrine Pt. 1 & 2. anyone seen it?
2016-01-18 21:17:12	@indeedwatson	never heard of it
2016-01-18 21:17:43	RyanSmallwood	I saw the first part and liked it, but never got around to watching part 2
2016-01-18 21:21:59	thewillmatic__	thats a good sign then.it looks good
2016-01-18 21:24:39	@indeedwatson	im losing interesting in MaM after ep 8
2016-01-18 21:25:01	RyanSmallwood	I heard some reviews saying it felt it went on too long
2016-01-18 21:25:51	thewillmatic__	you talking about Mesrine or MaM?
2016-01-18 21:26:08	@indeedwatson	i've been feeling it's stretched out from ep2 already

2016-01-18 22:55:28	@indeedwatson	nice, welcome!
2016-01-18 22:55:41	spot45	I am well, just been enjoying my last day on break before school
2016-01-18 22:55:45	spot45	and thanks
2016-01-18 22:55:52	@indeedwatson	seen any good movies lately?
2016-01-18 22:57:11	spot45	i watched I Vitelloni by Federico Fellini that I really enjoyed
2016-01-18 22:57:59	spot45	i've been trying to watch more Italian films , mostly from Italian NeoRealism
2016-01-18 22:58:04	spot45	what about you?
2016-01-18 22:58:11	Card1974	02:06 <@Av3> netflix has now blocked most vpn provideries
2016-01-18 22:58:13	Card1974	02:06 <@Av3> also digitalocean is now banned, among others
2016-01-18 22:58:18	Card1974	02:07 <@Av3> apparently all known vpn exit ranges are now banned
2016-01-18 22:58:31	spot45	heard about that.
2016-01-18 22:58:39	spot45	that sucks :(
2016-01-18 22:58:50	@indeedwatson	spot45: im still pretty ignorant about that "genre" but i hope to correct that
2016-01-18 22:58:53	Card1974	for me, unblock US still work atm, don't know how for long
2016-01-18 23:00:00	spot45	yeah same here, I've really enjoyed the movies that i've watched so far
2016-01-18 23:00:14	Card1974	*for how long, even
2016-01-18 23:00:56	spot45	I wonder if they would lose a lot of clients because of it
2016-01-18 23:02:20	@indeedwatson	probably
2016-01-18 23:02:24	@indeedwatson	not sure if a lot
2016-01-18 23:02:47	Card1974	mm, the long term plan is to bring the same content available everywhere, so the unblockers would be redundant anyway
2016-01-18 23:03:00	Card1974	I guess we'll see
2016-01-18 23:03:35	spot45	That would be nice
2016-01-18 23:03:56	spot45	I don't know if copyright holders would like it however
2016-01-18 23:04:07	Card1974	I suspect it'll take quite some time
2016-01-18 23:04:50	spot45	which suck for people who don
2016-01-18 23:05:03	spot45	don't live in the U.S
2016-01-18 23:05:43	@indeedwatson	specially for things only released in netflix
2016-01-18 23:07:08	spot45	I thought Netflix's original series and movies were available for everyone who had it  the service.
2016-01-18 23:08:28	@indeedwatson	oh might be

2016-01-19 22:53:16	@Carson	anyone want to talk about Oscar noms?
2016-01-19 22:53:45	RyanSmallwood	sure, what do you want to talk about?
2016-01-19 22:54:15	thewillmatic__	hi Carson
2016-01-19 22:54:38	@Carson	who do you think will win for best picture?
2016-01-19 22:55:13	@Carson	I'm also underwhelmed by The Martian, it's good and all
2016-01-19 22:55:18	thewillmatic__	i dont think bridge of spies or martian really deserved a spot in best picture. and i hope sicario wins for soundtrack/score.
2016-01-19 22:55:40	RyanSmallwood	I actually haven't seen most of them :/
2016-01-19 22:55:40	@Carson	but if that won best picture I'd be surprised
2016-01-19 22:55:50	RyanSmallwood	I want Mad Max to win, but I'm placing my bets on The Revenant
2016-01-19 22:56:01	@Carson	i think the Revenant has top spot
2016-01-19 22:56:02	@Carson	and hope
2016-01-19 22:56:38	@Carson	Mad Max was fine but I think it will just win the sfx awards
2016-01-19 22:56:59	@Carson	I'm not a huge fan of that film has most people are
2016-01-19 22:57:18	@Carson	I think Miller should get best director
2016-01-19 22:57:32	@Carson	mainly because he is old, and made one of his best films
2016-01-19 22:57:39	@indeedwatson	is SW nominated for anything?
2016-01-19 22:57:43	TempSpastic	I don't think Miller getting director is outside the realm of possibility
2016-01-19 22:57:59	TempSpastic	but the Revenant is pretty set to sweep
2016-01-19 22:58:02	thewillmatic__	indeedwatson: soundtrack
2016-01-19 22:58:11	@Carson	Leo getting his first oscar for best actor
2016-01-19 22:59:00	@Carson	also would like to see an underdog win of Brie Larson in Room
2016-01-19 22:59:03	RyanSmallwood	SW is nominated for editing, original score, sound editing, sound mixing, and visual effects
2016-01-19 22:59:23	@Carson	I think John Williams will get best score
2016-01-19 22:59:36	@Carson	for Star Wars, because of his age
2016-01-19 22:59:45	thewillmatic__	i hope sicario gets at least something. i liked that one.
2016-01-19 23:00:19	RyanSmallwood	ennio morricone is older
2016-01-19 23:00:29	@Carson	true
2016-01-19 23:00:49	@Carson	I'm betting on all the old people, but that's not always the case
2016-01-19 23:01:23	RyanSmallwood	I think Williams has won 5 already
2016-01-19 23:01:42	RyanSmallwood	morricone funnily enough won and honary one :D
2016-01-19 23:02:35	RyanSmallwood	morricone is the second oldest nominee in history
2016-01-19 23:02:37	RyanSmallwood	:O
2016-01-19 23:03:16	@Carson	damn
2016-01-19 23:04:24	RyanSmallwood	I think mad max could win editing too

2016-01-19 23:06:19	uguuuu	the revenant was the first film shot entirely on the alexa 65
2016-01-19 23:06:21	@Carson	and I just worry more about theater films because I am paying money and feel like I have to sit there throughout
2016-01-19 23:06:31	TempSpastic	ah
2016-01-19 23:06:36	@Carson	also might go with a friend

2016-01-19 23:09:54	@Carson	yeah I actually have it downloaded
2016-01-19 23:10:03	@Carson	and could bring myself to watch it on a small tv

2016-01-19 23:16:31	RyanSmallwood	need to see an occasional bad movie to lower your standards a bit
2016-01-19 23:16:37	@indeedwatson	heh
2016-01-19 23:16:49	Mothravka	You mean a movie you have seen before?
2016-01-19 23:16:50	@indeedwatson	i disagree
2016-01-19 23:16:59	Mothravka	Or a movie that you feel will be bad?
2016-01-19 23:18:09	uguuuu	i feel like if you watch too many bad movies in a row you sort of lose hope in cinema
2016-01-19 23:18:32	Mothravka	Cinema is dead, long live the cinema.

2016-01-19 23:19:12	@indeedwatson	because if you read good philosophers in a row you get overly critical of philosophers?

2016-01-19 23:20:26	@indeedwatson	well i feel the same way about movies that have no redeeming qualities
2016-01-19 23:20:39	uguuuu	reading too much good film discussion leads to me becoming overly critical, so that's why i visit......
2016-01-19 23:20:39	RyanSmallwood	there are movies that aren't worth watching period
2016-01-19 23:20:51	RyanSmallwood	but there are some bad movies that can be useful to watch
2016-01-19 23:21:13	RyanSmallwood	but it also depends on ones time and interests
2016-01-19 23:21:18	Mothravka	Yeah.
2016-01-19 23:21:19	@indeedwatson	should i do that B movie screening i wanted to do?
2016-01-19 23:21:53	RyanSmallwood	I like learning about a countries whole film history, so I like learning about failures and successes,  but for literature I'm more than happy just to have experts recommend the masterpieces to me
2016-01-19 23:22:57	@indeedwatson	the literary equivalent is reading really bad fan fiction
2016-01-19 23:23:46	RyanSmallwood	different levels
2016-01-19 23:23:53	RyanSmallwood	I don't go on youtube and watch tons of student films
2016-01-19 23:24:17	uguuuu	r-right
2016-01-19 23:24:33	uguuuu	a bad mainstream film says something about culture and the industry
2016-01-19 23:25:05	@indeedwatson	you don't really need to watch it to know that tho
2016-01-19 23:27:27	RyanSmallwood	I find when I watch through a certain film industry from a certain period without regard to which movies were  considered memorable or important, I learn a lot and find a lot of interesting but flawed films, hidden gems, and  bad films that make good examples of what good films do right
2016-01-19 23:29:55	RyanSmallwood	I agree its not necessary for everyone, one of the things I hope to do with my HK video essays is try to condense what I learn from watching a wider selection of films so people can get wider exposure to the industry without sitting through hundreds of films
2016-01-19 23:30:16	uguuuu	you da real mvp

2016-01-19 23:44:38	@indeedwatson	you/
2016-01-19 23:44:39	@indeedwatson	?
2016-01-19 23:45:49	spot45	Which ones, and I got home from school not that long ago. so I'm just chilling now
2016-01-19 23:47:15	@indeedwatson	we didn't mention specifics, RyanSmallwood was saying they're worth watching to learn stuff
2016-01-19 23:47:47	spot45	I also went to go see The Revenant yesterday
2016-01-19 23:48:03	RyanSmallwood	we were talking about that too a bit earlier
2016-01-19 23:48:36	spot45	cool, how do you put people's name? do you just type it out?
2016-01-19 23:48:43	spot45	Have you seen it?
2016-01-19 23:48:58	TempSpastic	you can hit tab to complete after you type the first few letters
2016-01-19 23:49:17	spot45	thanks TempSpastic
2016-01-19 23:49:18	TempSpastic	what'd you think of The Revenant
2016-01-19 23:49:22	TempSpastic	no prob spot45
2016-01-19 23:49:41	RyanSmallwood	Yeah, I like it  alot, Carson hasn't seen it yet though so no spoilers
2016-01-19 23:49:45	uguuuu	i type all names manually
2016-01-19 23:49:49	uguuuu	as a matter of principle
2016-01-19 23:50:08	spot45	I liked it, however it felt a bit slow and the ending was kind of a let down TempSpastic
2016-01-19 23:50:16	TempSpastic	hmm
2016-01-19 23:50:44	Mothravka	I thought it was the total opposite of slow.
2016-01-19 23:51:26	spot45	but I would like to watch it again  preferably with subtitles TempSpastic
2016-01-19 23:51:36	TempSpastic	you saw it without?

2016-01-19 23:52:27	@indeeeeeeeeeeeee	who are you talking to
2016-01-19 23:52:33	Mothravka	Everyone.
2016-01-19 23:52:36	spot45	Maybe slow was the wrong word but at parts I was trying not to fall asleep. Mothravka
2016-01-19 23:52:40	uguuuu	you
2016-01-19 23:52:45	Mothravka	Oh.
2016-01-19 23:52:47	uguuuu	-_-)-b
2016-01-19 23:53:17	RyanSmallwood	trick to not falling asleep in movies is to get a good sleep at night
2016-01-19 23:53:20	Mothravka	spot45: Then I don't think the movie was slow, it seems more likely that you were tired. Heh.
2016-01-19 23:54:21	spot45	Maybe, I'm going to give the movie any chance and watch it again Mothravka
2016-01-19 23:54:55	@indeeeeeeeeeeeee	how long is it?
2016-01-19 23:55:04	RyanSmallwood	The Six-fingered Lord of the Lute Part 3 is so damn nuts compared to the first two parts
2016-01-19 23:55:34	Mothravka	156 minutes according to IMDb.
2016-01-19 23:55:53	spot45	RyanSmallwood: I went to go see it at night
2016-01-19 23:56:09	RyanSmallwood	thats why you were sleepy then :)
2016-01-19 23:57:23	spot45	RyanSmallwood:  yeah like I said, I'm going to give the movie another chance and see if it was because i was tired.
2016-01-20 00:00:31	RyanSmallwood	or maybe you were watching the movie correctly according to Abbas Kiarostami https://youtu.be/uSDWtdJKrG0?t=36s
2016-01-20 00:00:31		[ http://is.gd/oRiWaa ]
2016-01-20 00:03:05	spot45	RyanSmallwood:  Haha maybe
2016-01-20 00:03:35	Mothravka	Hope we get a new movie from him soon.
2016-01-20 00:03:57	spot45	never heard of him until now
2016-01-20 00:04:28	Mothravka	Damn.
2016-01-20 00:04:35	RyanSmallwood	Like Someone in Love was tremendous, my favorite film that year
2016-01-20 00:05:00	RyanSmallwood	and I really really liked The Master which also came out that year
2016-01-20 00:06:09	spot45	looks interesting, I've add it to my watch list
2016-01-20 00:07:09	Mothravka	"Cinema begins with D.W. Griffith and ends with Abbas Kiarostami."
2016-01-20 00:07:17	RyanSmallwood	who said that?
2016-01-20 00:07:28	uguuuu	not abbas kiarostami i hope
2016-01-20 00:07:34	Mothravka	Guess!
2016-01-20 00:07:35	TempSpastic	lmao
2016-01-20 00:07:43	spot45	RyanSmallwood: do you have a movie that you've been meaning to watch for some time  but for whatever reason just haven't?
2016-01-20 00:07:46	RyanSmallwood	I object to D.W. Griffith being the beginning
2016-01-20 00:08:22	Mothravka	Say it to Godard.
2016-01-20 00:08:54	RyanSmallwood	spot45: probably the biggest 2 I've managed to avoid for some reason are Paris, Texas and Wings of Desire
2016-01-20 00:11:22	spot45	RyanSmallwood:  I don't really have too many on my watch list but for some reason I've been meaning to watch Schindler List but just haven't
2016-01-20 00:11:44	RyanSmallwood	hah, I haven't seen that one and I'm not planning to anytime soon
2016-01-20 00:12:05	spot45	RyanSmallwood:  ahah why so?
2016-01-20 00:12:32	RyanSmallwood	just too many other things I'm more interested in
2016-01-20 00:12:37	TempSpastic	cause it's hip to hate spielberg
2016-01-20 00:12:51	RyanSmallwood	I don't hate spielberg he's just not my #1 priority
2016-01-20 00:13:06	Mothravka	it seems to be more hip to love him though.
2016-01-20 00:13:15	RyanSmallwood	the hipster scale goes back and forth
2016-01-20 00:13:18	TempSpastic	^
2016-01-20 00:13:29	RyanSmallwood	people became aware that it was hip to hate him so now its hip to acknowledge he's competent
2016-01-20 00:13:33	Mothravka	Everything seems to be hipster.
2016-01-20 00:13:35	spot45	i guess its pretty low on you list of movie to watch that it doesn't register RyanSmallwood
2016-01-20 00:13:40	TempSpastic	it's the critical mass
2016-01-20 00:14:40	RyanSmallwood	spot45: no I'm just really into movies up to the 60s and 70s, and I have  hundreds of films from the early era I still need to see,  its nothing to do with spielberg so much as the thousands of   interesting films floating around
2016-01-20 00:14:50	spot45	how do you find about all these different types of films, and how do you keep up with new ones that are coming out from out countries?
2016-01-20 00:15:11	RyanSmallwood	ehhh it depends, everyone has their own specialties
2016-01-20 00:15:29	RyanSmallwood	I like reading lots of film history books which always gives me lots of old movies to watch
2016-01-20 00:15:39	spot45	I guess there isn't any one place to check huh
2016-01-20 00:15:42	RyanSmallwood	I don't follow festival cinema too closely outside a few directors I know
2016-01-20 00:15:51	Mothravka	Internet can help a lot.
2016-01-20 00:15:58	RyanSmallwood	but I have friends who follow festival cinema much closer than I do and they always tell me when there's something I can't miss
2016-01-20 00:16:15	RyanSmallwood	talk about movies, read about movies, watch movies, and you'll keep finding movies to watch
2016-01-20 00:16:54	spot45	that sounds about right
2016-01-20 00:17:14	Mothravka	Don't forget to examine movies critically too. For at least six years.
2016-01-20 00:17:58	spot45	what do you mean for at least six years? Like examine a movie for ix years or examine movies for six years?
2016-01-20 00:18:07	Mothravka	No. Movies.
2016-01-20 00:18:16	Mothravka	Heh.
2016-01-20 00:18:55	Mothravka	I should go to bed soon.
2016-01-20 00:18:58	Mothravka	It's getting late.
2016-01-20 00:19:23	@indeeeeeeeeeeeee	6 year long movie
2016-01-20 00:19:36	Mothravka	You are a 6 year long movie.

2016-01-20 00:38:13	RyanSmallwood	that Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin announced he's going to buy Legendary Entertainment

2016-01-20 00:38:34	RyanSmallwood	I'm super curious what he'll start making
2016-01-20 00:38:47	RyanSmallwood	it would be interesting to see another country produce films on the same scale as hollywood, maybe bigger

2016-01-20 16:12:05	thewillmatic__	i have a copy of that on my HDD :P
2016-01-20 16:12:29	blushingpancake	oo did you watch it?

2016-01-20 16:13:14	blushingpancake	i recommend it, it's a pretty unusual indie movie
2016-01-20 16:13:27	blushingpancake	that goes through like three genre shifts in the span of 1 1/2 hours...........

2016-01-20 19:52:54	RyanSmallwood	I have more lists! they're not on letterboxd yet though
2016-01-20 19:53:09	@indeedwatson	well get to it!
2016-01-20 19:53:24	RyanSmallwood	probably not that obsessive though
2016-01-20 19:54:17	@indeedwatson	digitalis has 38 lists lol
2016-01-20 19:59:37	@indeedwatson	i think this year instead of having a specific number of films as a goal, im gonna have the goal of every month watching more movies than the previous month
2016-01-20 20:01:11	Mothravka	Seems quite easy.
2016-01-20 20:01:26	Mothravka	How many movies have you watched this month? 7?
2016-01-20 20:01:32	@indeedwatson	so far
2016-01-20 20:01:46	@indeedwatson	8 counting h8 8 tonight at 8pm
2016-01-20 20:01:57	@indeedwatson	actually at 10pm but i thought it was funny
2016-01-20 20:04:38	uguuuu	i've watched one movie
2016-01-20 20:04:46	uguuuu	if i don't watch any more, i can do this for the rest of the year
2016-01-20 20:04:52	uguuuu	one, two, three, etc
2016-01-20 20:04:54	Mothravka	You go!
2016-01-20 20:05:55	@indeedwatson	78 movies in a year, that'd be fine by my standards
2016-01-20 20:07:03	@indeedwatson	i like this idea https://www.reddit.com/r/flicks/comments/41wu5g/idea_you_name_an_outofplace_scene_that_you_dont/

2016-01-21 01:27:33	@indeedwatson	RyanSmallwood_ tomflint really enjoyed H8
2016-01-21 01:27:49	tomflint	even more the second time!
2016-01-21 01:27:56	tomflint	I can't speak to the non-roadshow version.
2016-01-21 01:28:09	tomflint	I'd suggest doing an actual intermission after the big speech
2016-01-21 01:28:41	@indeedwatson	what's the difference?
2016-01-21 01:28:51	@indeedwatson	my friend thought the movie was 90min long i was like wtf
2016-01-21 01:28:59	tomflint	haha
2016-01-21 01:29:51	tomflint	the roadshow has the overture and a 15 minute intermission. I think the normal one skips that and just carries on. The trouble is, Tarantino comes in as a voice over and says, 'It's been fifteen minutes since...'
2016-01-21 01:30:09	tomflint	its a critical plot point -- but wouldn't feel right without an actual break
2016-01-21 01:30:29	@indeedwatson	heh
2016-01-21 01:30:43	@indeedwatson	i thought the narration was a bit off putting
2016-01-21 01:30:48	@indeedwatson	mostly cause it just shows up
2016-01-21 01:31:24	@indeedwatson	i think i might give it 4 stars, which would be an 8 in a 10 scale.... I think i was brainwashed by the title
2016-01-21 01:35:43	tomflint	well, its needed to bounce back --
2016-01-21 01:36:10	tomflint	overall, the film is meant to be viewed like a theatre production -- so in that, his voice is both awful but works
2016-01-21 01:36:33	@indeedwatson	it's not so much the narration in itself, but that it shows up at the middle of the film
2016-01-21 01:37:48	tomflint	yeah -- but its after the intermission. I've heard that its awkward for the normal cut
2016-01-21 01:40:18	tomflint	I really enjoyed it as a film -- but I think I'll use the intermission time to get some water and stuff so it holds up
2016-01-21 01:40:21	tomflint	which sounds weird
2016-01-21 01:42:28	@indeedwatson	i think if he had put some narration near the beginning, it would have felt less weird
2016-01-21 01:42:43	tomflint	but what purpose would it serve?
2016-01-21 01:43:57	@indeedwatson	the narration as a whole, or having it introduced earlier?
2016-01-21 01:45:05	tomflint	I don't think narration at any other time would work
2016-01-21 01:45:17	@indeedwatson	i think the narration felt unecessary in itself, but having it earlier would have made an omniscient narrator a surprise
2016-01-21 01:45:37	@indeedwatson	would have not made it a suprise i mean
2016-01-21 01:48:07	@indeedwatson	like you can establish narrative elements at the beginning, and if you don't and you introduce them later on, they have to either be eased in (like the blood and violence) or a surprise element (like a certain character), and i don't think he wanted the narration to be a surprise element
2016-01-21 01:48:11	tomflint	how else would you have introduced the recap?
2016-01-21 01:48:36	@indeedwatson	i'm sure quentin is smart enough to figure out how to do that visually somehow
2016-01-21 01:48:53	@indeedwatson	but i feel he wanted the narration, maybe for the reason you say
2016-01-21 01:49:04	tomflint	ha. for me, I loved it -- it really solidified the theatre feel to it
2016-01-21 01:49:14	tomflint	less that he was a narrator and more that he was the host
2016-01-21 01:49:18	@indeedwatson	im not saying it takes anything away from the movie, but it took me away for a moment, and it didn't add anything
2016-01-21 01:49:30	@indeedwatson	but a host, you know him from the start

2016-01-21 01:53:37	thewillmatic__	i see. i do the same.
2016-01-21 01:53:43	@indeedwatson	except you know, who's involved and general opinions
2016-01-21 01:53:45	thewillmatic__	i think going into movies 100% blind is fun
2016-01-21 01:54:04	thewillmatic__	sometimes it’s impossible. i tend to find out the big names involved.
2016-01-21 01:54:42	@indeedwatson	well i wouldn't want that cause i rather not watch movies that if i knew some people involved, i'd know i wouldn't want to spend the time
2016-01-21 02:10:53	tomflint	I made the unfortunate mistake of watching Rock the Kasbah last night purely based on the cast and director
2016-01-21 02:10:57	tomflint	it was awful
2016-01-21 02:13:14	@indeedwatson	what director?
2016-01-21 02:24:37	tomflint	Barry Levinson
2016-01-21 02:26:04	@indeedwatson	what did he do that made you wanna watch it?
2016-01-21 02:27:12	@indeedwatson	gtg sleep, tell me tomorrow
2016-01-21 02:27:19	tomflint	ha. word.
2016-01-21 02:27:20	tomflint	nigth!
2016-01-21 02:27:23	tomflint	*night!

2016-01-21 20:57:14	RyanSmallwood	is this channel seeming like it may be dieing off? Seems there are less people in here lately...
2016-01-21 21:07:07	@indeedwatson	maybe, some people became lurkers for some reason
2016-01-21 21:07:11	uguuuu	RIP
2016-01-21 21:07:17	@indeedwatson	idk what happened with porkepik
2016-01-21 21:07:19	uguuuu	i'll shitpost more to make up for it
2016-01-21 21:07:53	@indeedwatson	ty
2016-01-21 21:08:45	RyanSmallwood	I'm sure Porkepik will stop in, just taking more breaks
2016-01-21 21:12:13	uguuuu	i'll tell you about all the movies i'm not watching
2016-01-21 21:13:01	@indeedwatson	RyanSmallwood: did i mentioned i loved the h8 ost?
2016-01-21 21:13:31	RyanSmallwood	not sure, but great! I really liked the score
2016-01-21 21:14:23	@indeedwatson	i think you weren't around when i talked about the film with tomflint 
2016-01-21 21:14:58	RyanSmallwood	ahh
2016-01-21 21:16:21	RyanSmallwood	I just found out  John Wick was a movie I didn't watch or know about, and I know about it now because of the Key and Peele parody trailer Keanu
2016-01-21 21:16:34	tomflint	that trailer is amazing, eh
2016-01-21 21:16:43	tomflint	John Wick RULES though
2016-01-21 21:17:51	tomflint	I love it because on the surface its almost like an action satire -- but its so well made that it results in a really solid action film
2016-01-21 21:19:04	uguuuu	waitasec
2016-01-21 21:19:10	uguuuu	you liked john wick but not fury road
2016-01-21 21:19:13	uguuuu	that's interesting ~
2016-01-21 21:19:44	@indeedwatson	i asked him for recent action films he liked and he couldn't think of any! the phony!
2016-01-21 21:20:53	@indeedwatson	i feel mad max was the opposite case of sw
2016-01-21 21:21:17	@indeedwatson	everybody talked about sw all the time before it came out, but now it's been a few weeks and i don't see any discussion anymore
2016-01-21 21:21:29	@indeedwatson	while mm sort of came out of nowhere and everyone raved about it after
2016-01-21 21:22:51	uguuuu	hmm
2016-01-21 21:23:21	uguuuu	probably because there's nothing formally or artistically interesting about star wars
2016-01-21 21:23:22	uguuuu	:V
2016-01-21 21:23:23	RyanSmallwood	I still see SW stories
2016-01-21 21:23:33	RyanSmallwood	:/
2016-01-21 21:23:49	@indeedwatson	where?
2016-01-21 21:23:57	@indeedwatson	i don't see anything on my reddit
2016-01-21 21:24:05	uguuuu	and we'll see a resurgence with the home video releases i imagine
2016-01-21 21:24:08	RyanSmallwood	not on reddit, but there's still news stories
2016-01-21 21:24:16	RyanSmallwood	episode 8 release delayed
2016-01-21 21:24:24	RyanSmallwood	disney part of the conspiracy to not make any Rey toys
2016-01-21 21:24:25	RyanSmallwood	stuff like that
2016-01-21 21:24:37	@indeedwatson	ah yeas i saw that about ep8, but it doesn't count as discussion of the movie
2016-01-21 21:24:47	@indeedwatson	of ep7
2016-01-21 21:25:03	@indeedwatson	and also, i don't think i saw it pop up in anyone's top 10 of 2015
2016-01-21 21:25:47	RyanSmallwood	its in my top 10 :/
2016-01-21 21:26:00	@indeedwatson	shh
2016-01-21 21:26:28	@indeedwatson	:p
2016-01-21 21:26:37	@indeedwatson	i don't think i've even seen 10 2015 movies
2016-01-21 21:27:14	tomflint	ha
2016-01-21 21:27:54	tomflint	I'm going to watch Fury Road again in hopes that I missed something
2016-01-21 21:28:48	@indeedwatson	it'd be weird if you rewatched it in small screen and liked it more than in theaters tho
2016-01-21 21:28:56	uguuuu	what if you hated it even more :O
2016-01-21 21:29:08	@indeedwatson	i need to watch it high, that'd be interesting
2016-01-21 21:29:18	tomflint	ha
2016-01-21 21:29:47	tomflint	well, so far I've watched it half way through, turned it off, rewatched it completely, hated it --- but I will give it another go.
2016-01-21 21:29:57	tomflint	it'll only feel like six hours wasted..
2016-01-21 21:30:37	RyanSmallwood	why do you completely hate it?
2016-01-21 21:30:45	RyanSmallwood	maybe we already discussed this
2016-01-21 21:30:48	RyanSmallwood	I'm still baffled
2016-01-21 21:31:20	tomflint	well, a good portion of the audio felt off, for starters ---
2016-01-21 21:31:26	tomflint	like they dubbed it.
2016-01-21 21:31:39	tomflint	I just don't like the chase movies --
2016-01-21 21:31:57	tomflint	there's also nothing worse than a pregnant woman in the backseat either
2016-01-21 21:32:31	tomflint	when I first turned it off I had a list of things that I was hating on. I can't remember the final straw -- but it hit that point.
2016-01-21 21:32:52	tomflint	I'll keep a list this time
2016-01-21 21:32:57	uguuuu	can we all at least agree that the new star wars is completely without value
2016-01-21 21:33:21	@indeedwatson	probably RyanSmallwood can't agree with that
2016-01-21 21:33:25	tomflint	the worst!
2016-01-21 21:33:49	tomflint	I went to it alone and the dude on my left was going bonkers while the guy on my right was like us
2016-01-21 21:34:14	tomflint	during the credits he said, 'I hope this was purely for world building and not a taste of the future...'
2016-01-21 21:34:34	@indeedwatson	a stranger talked to you on the cinema? i never had that happen
2016-01-21 21:34:52	@indeedwatson	and btw if you guys clap in theaters we can no longer be friends
2016-01-21 21:34:52	tomflint	I have one of those faces, I guess
2016-01-21 21:35:35	tomflint	I'm usually the one to start the clapping --- and never on opening night and never when its really appropriate. I like to herd the people though
2016-01-21 21:36:00	@indeedwatson	noo, you need to stop that
2016-01-21 21:36:06	@indeedwatson	there's no one there to receive the claps!
2016-01-21 21:36:07	tomflint	its hilarious!
2016-01-21 21:36:12	tomflint	RIGHT!
2016-01-21 21:36:14	tomflint	I love it
2016-01-21 21:36:14	RyanSmallwood	you can clap if the filmmaker is presenting the film
2016-01-21 21:36:31	@indeedwatson	that will probably never happen in my whole life
2016-01-21 21:36:37	tomflint	try it sometime though -- just start clapping and others will naturally join in for no reason
2016-01-21 21:36:42	@indeedwatson	so they're clapping at the dude who pressed play on the digital projector
2016-01-21 21:36:47	@indeedwatson	i refuse
2016-01-21 21:36:57	uguuuu	there was minor clapping when i saw it
2016-01-21 21:36:58	uguuuu	a worrying trend
2016-01-21 21:37:14	tomflint	on opening nights there's always applause in Vancouver though
2016-01-21 21:37:33	tomflint	well, for festival and our type of movies
2016-01-21 21:37:36	tomflint	not for Transformers
2016-01-21 21:38:12	RyanSmallwood	uguuuu: the new star wars rocks
2016-01-21 21:38:50	tomflint	the best thing I've ever experienced in a theatre was after the trailer for The Pirates of the Caribbean when Lord of the Rings first came out.
2016-01-21 21:39:06	tomflint	This guy said, 'Rated ARRRRRR' and the theatre was laughing for about 8 minutes ---
2016-01-21 21:39:10	tomflint	it was insane
2016-01-21 21:39:13	@indeedwatson	lol
2016-01-21 21:39:28	@indeedwatson	that tops lawreence of arabia in 70mm i guess
2016-01-21 21:40:24	tomflint	oh man, that's such a pretty movie in 70mm --
2016-01-21 21:40:33	tomflint	its a shame there aren't more 70mm theatres around
2016-01-21 21:41:04	RyanSmallwood	I will never watch it again, but Snakes on a Plane was lots of fun opening night
2016-01-21 21:41:11	@indeedwatson	i wish home projectors weren't so expensive
2016-01-21 21:41:38	tomflint	YES!
2016-01-21 21:42:05	AlexJ44	(just wanted to say hi and yes, I'm still alive)
2016-01-21 21:42:12	tomflint	hola AlexJ44
2016-01-21 21:42:35	tomflint	I have an older projector. It's currently at a friend's house.
2016-01-21 21:42:53	tomflint	it's handy, but you need to make sure you get one that's nearly silent
2016-01-21 21:43:02	AlexJ44	tomflint: if you clap, it should be on opening night, right?
2016-01-21 21:43:08	AlexJ44	I might want to pick up that trend as well
2016-01-21 21:43:18	RyanSmallwood	no no no no no
2016-01-21 21:43:22	tomflint	only on opening night -- even then it doesn't make sense...
2016-01-21 21:43:26	RyanSmallwood	only if there's someone to clap for
2016-01-21 21:43:33	tomflint	but getting people to clap during the third week is better
2016-01-21 21:43:38	AlexJ44	LOL
2016-01-21 21:43:40	AlexJ44	yeah
2016-01-21 21:43:54	AlexJ44	I like clapping at films
2016-01-21 21:44:21	RyanSmallwood	if you see a silent film with live music accompaniment, you can clap for that too
2016-01-21 21:44:21	tomflint	years ago I was a youth leader. We were at this conference thing and would start random applause in this stadium of about 10,000 people
2016-01-21 21:44:29	tomflint	nobody was paying attention, so it was perfect
2016-01-21 21:45:15	tomflint	this was also the year before Vancouver was going to have the Olympics. Whoever was doing the slideshow put up a photo of the olympic rings, but it was actually five colored condoms --
2016-01-21 21:45:23	tomflint	comedy gold for the Christians
2016-01-21 21:46:15	AlexJ44	lol, nice!
2016-01-21 21:46:44	tomflint	if you get a group of about 20 people laughing, others will naturally join in for some reason
2016-01-21 21:47:32	RyanSmallwood	yeah laughter is infectious like that

2016-01-21 22:07:18	AlexJ44	by the way tomflint : i've only watched 35mm once in my entire life
2016-01-21 22:07:32	AlexJ44	I should set a life goal to have a 35mm projector on-demand on my town
2016-01-21 22:11:19	@indeedwatson	before i did that i'd make sure my eyes can tell the difference
2016-01-21 22:12:55	tomflint	35mm is decent --
2016-01-21 22:13:04	tomflint	you can mostly tell with bright whites
2016-01-21 22:15:29	thewillmatic__	what type of maths you in, AlexJ44 ?
2016-01-21 22:16:31	tomflint	AlexJ44: you can still catch 70mm -- but its IMAX stuff. They shoot the frame sideways so its actually a higher resolution
2016-01-21 22:17:14	AlexJ44	thewillmatic__ : i'm not sure how you'd call it in the us, but I'm in college. undergraduate?
2016-01-21 22:17:37	AlexJ44	tomflint i've only got one imax in the whole country. it's soon going to be expanded to two, and it will be some 60km away from where I live atm
2016-01-21 22:17:37	tomflint	I believe they call that 'over-sexed'
2016-01-21 22:17:40	AlexJ44	so I'm waiting for that
2016-01-21 22:17:46	thewillmatic__	i just meant stats, calculus, physics, chem
2016-01-21 22:18:31	RyanSmallwood	most imax theaters these days are digital imax
2016-01-21 22:18:55	tomflint	yeah -- there is the odd one. Most big cities have one that's lagging
2016-01-21 22:19:17	AlexJ44	well, I'm in math
2016-01-21 22:19:19	tomflint	its a shame to see it fading out, but digital saves the actual theatres a lot of work

2016-01-22 00:01:17	tomflint	its easier than you think :)
2016-01-22 00:01:31	RyanSmallwood	probably
2016-01-22 00:01:50	tomflint	as with anything, if you have the right tools, it's really easy
2016-01-22 00:02:09	@indeedwatson	i wouldn't say it's really easy
2016-01-22 00:02:17	tomflint	you don't need much -- mainly a sheet of steel, a wooden pizza peel, and an aluminum peel --
2016-01-22 00:04:20	RyanSmallwood	why a wooden peel and an aluminum peel?
2016-01-22 00:04:40	tomflint	the grain of the wood takes in the flour that you dust it with -- preventing the dough to stick
2016-01-22 00:04:47	tomflint	*from sticking....
2016-01-22 00:05:13	tomflint	the aluminum one is usually a little longer and much thinner, so its easy to scoop under the pie without moving it
2016-01-22 00:05:28	RyanSmallwood	gotya
2016-01-22 00:05:51	@indeedwatson	i don't use any of those lol
2016-01-22 00:06:25	tomflint	mainly, make your dough three days in advance, store it in the fridge. On the day of, bring it out, shape it into a ball, and let it sit for a few hours under a dusted tea towel or whatever you have.
2016-01-22 00:07:28	tomflint	once your oven / steel is preheated, stretch out that dough on the dusted peel and slap your shit on it. Launch it in the oven for however long it takes to bake. while its doing that, build your second pie. Let the pies rest for about 8 minutes, and you're golden.
2016-01-22 00:07:47	tomflint	the ladies will go bananas

2016-01-22 18:32:19	gallusgallusdome	has it started already?
2016-01-22 18:32:50	@Carson	yes it started early this morning
2016-01-22 18:32:56	@Carson	around 2am
2016-01-22 18:33:08	@Carson	looks like it's just starting to hit dc now
2016-01-22 18:33:22	gallusgallusdome	yeah it started a couple hours ago
2016-01-22 18:33:36	@Carson	what do you do for a living
2016-01-22 18:33:44	gallusgallusdome	still in school haha
2016-01-22 18:34:03	@Carson	studying what?
2016-01-22 18:34:13	@Carson	or are you not in college
2016-01-22 18:34:31	@indeedwatson	gallusgallusdome: you asked about joan of arc earlier right?
2016-01-22 18:34:56	gallusgallusdome	yeah that was me
2016-01-22 18:35:04	@indeedwatson	are we talking who we thinks wins, or which movie we liked the most?

2016-01-22 18:35:20	@indeedwatson	gallusgallusdome: did you find out anything? cause that movie is next on my watch list
2016-01-22 18:36:40	@Carson	who do you think will get best actress?
2016-01-22 18:36:51	@Carson	what about joan of arc?
2016-01-22 18:37:07	@indeedwatson	he was asking which was the best version to watch
2016-01-22 18:37:32	RyanSmallwood	haven't seen any of the films for best actress nominations :/
2016-01-22 18:38:12	gallusgallusdome	I think that the one with "voices of light" as the soundtrack is considered to be the best one to watch
2016-01-22 18:38:24	RyanSmallwood	mmmm debatable
2016-01-22 18:38:40	gallusgallusdome	what would you say? I'm still trying to find the right one
2016-01-22 18:38:59	RyanSmallwood	Dreyer famously said he thought the film should be watched dead silent without any soundtrack, but not everyone necessarily follows his orders on that front
2016-01-22 18:39:15	RyanSmallwood	I think most DVDs have that option (if you're too lazy to mute)
2016-01-22 18:39:30	gallusgallusdome	damn I haven't seen any best actress movies either
2016-01-22 18:39:41	@Carson	best cinematography?
2016-01-22 18:39:57	@Carson	either hateful eight or the rev right?
2016-01-22 18:40:01	RyanSmallwood	voices of light is an interesting soundtrack, and I enjoyed watching it with it, but also unconventional if you're a stickler for historical accuracy
2016-01-22 18:40:16	@Carson	I've seen Room
2016-01-22 18:40:21	gallusgallusdome	hmm, I'll try silent first then
2016-01-22 18:40:31	gallusgallusdome	it's easier for me to find anyway
2016-01-22 18:41:09	gallusgallusdome	I think deakins has a shot
2016-01-22 18:41:14	gallusgallusdome	but it'll probably be rev
2016-01-22 18:42:08	@indeedwatson	i feel like revenant is going to be a bit meh for me
2016-01-22 18:42:24	@Carson	that means Lebezki will get the award 3 years in a row
2016-01-22 18:42:47	@Carson	I'm doubting it too indeed, everyone told me to not worry about it
2016-01-22 18:43:03	@Carson	Lebezki won with Gravity and Birdman
2016-01-22 18:43:26	RyanSmallwood	it probably won't come up on many trackers, but make sure not to get the "Lo Duca" cut of Joan of Arc
2016-01-22 18:45:16	gallusgallusdome	is that the one that was out before they found the original in the mental asylum/

2016-01-22 18:50:00	gallusgallusdome	the yt one is the silent one, so I think that's one I'm going to watch

2016-01-22 18:52:42	@indeedwatson	i think i'll put the silent one and then play voices of light in a separate video
2016-01-22 18:58:20	gallusgallusdome	what about best director?
2016-01-22 18:58:56	RyanSmallwood	George  Miller!
2016-01-22 18:59:28	Mothravka	Best director? Tarkovsky.
2016-01-22 18:59:51	@indeedwatson	how's the bryan cranston movie?
2016-01-22 19:00:51	@indeedwatson	TFA best editing?
2016-01-22 19:01:10	RyanSmallwood	nah, mad max for best editing
2016-01-22 19:01:30	@indeedwatson	i mean, i find it weird that it's nominated
2016-01-22 19:01:34	gallusgallusdome	I'm feeling big short for best editing
2016-01-22 19:01:56	RyanSmallwood	Tony Zhou was tweeting after Mad Max "I have so many nerdy editing questions!"
2016-01-22 19:02:41	gallusgallusdome	overall I think they did at least a bit better this year than last though
2016-01-22 19:02:45	@indeedwatson	gallusgallusdome: i havent seen that
2016-01-22 19:03:02	RyanSmallwood	I need to see the big short

2016-01-22 19:04:06	gallusgallusdome	I'm still behind too
2016-01-22 19:04:24	gallusgallusdome	33 movies on my 2015 list :(

2016-01-22 19:06:14	Mothravka	Like always.
2016-01-22 19:06:17	RyanSmallwood	Mothravka: you gave one-armed swordsman 3 stars, is that a "okay" 3 stars or a "meh" 3 stars

2016-01-22 19:07:41	Mothravka	That movie actually surprised me.
2016-01-22 19:08:03	RyanSmallwood	why's that?
2016-01-22 19:10:06	@indeedwatson	i heard about it
2016-01-22 19:10:19	gallusgallusdome	I think the margot robbie scene in the big short is just another part of it's obvious message on short attention spans, and the role sex, especially in machismo, plays in that.
2016-01-22 19:10:22	@indeedwatson	not sure if you mentioned it before RyanSmallwood or i heard it in bordwell's lecture about wushu
2016-01-22 19:10:46	gallusgallusdome	I didn't meant to post that sorry
2016-01-22 19:10:51	gallusgallusdome	what's the theme this month on truefilm/
2016-01-22 19:12:06	Mothravka	I remember that I disliked Five Deadly Venoms (1978) by Chang Cheh a lot, so I didn't expect a great movie. And I'm not a person that's in love with martial arts/wuxia films, so there's that too. That's why I was surprised over it.
2016-01-22 19:12:32	RyanSmallwood	gotya
2016-01-22 19:12:39	RyanSmallwood	yeah Chang Cheh's output is pretty uneven
2016-01-22 19:12:47	RyanSmallwood	I think Five Deadly Venoms is a bit overhyped
2016-01-22 19:12:57	Mothravka	Yeah.

2016-01-22 19:17:41	tomflint	I posted a text file of my notes last night

2016-01-22 19:18:58	Mothravka	I had a really hard time with that movie.
2016-01-22 19:19:04	Mothravka	It sounded much more interesting on the paper.
2016-01-22 19:19:15	scarlett-	i just watched parts of it
2016-01-22 19:19:19	scarlett-	but it seemed pretty good

2016-01-22 19:19:45	Mothravka	Why did you just watch parts? Or you mean you just watched some clips on YouTube?
2016-01-22 19:19:49	scarlett-	the thing where they have a conversation and then they reveal subtly that it was them just reading lines is pretty awesome
2016-01-22 19:20:01	scarlett-	no like it was going on in the background and i was doing something else
2016-01-22 19:20:06	Mothravka	Oh.
2016-01-22 19:20:08	scarlett-	and just watched certain parts

2016-01-22 19:51:14	tomflint	I guess it works -- but I was hoping for something bigger that would justify the movie being made
2016-01-22 19:51:37	Mothravka	It says that it's an action-adventure game.

2016-01-22 19:54:41	tomflint	I liked Gladiator -- but not that much.

2016-01-22 19:57:14	Mothravka	Oh.
2016-01-22 19:57:23	tomflint	but here's how that scale works:
2016-01-22 19:57:43	Mothravka	It works how you want it to work.
2016-01-22 19:58:31	RyanSmallwood	bela tarr should direct a star wars
2016-01-22 19:58:34	tomflint	as long as they write a script that makes sense and film it with someone who has a rough idea of what they're doing -- thats 5. 5 isn't good, but everything gets five
2016-01-22 19:58:59	tomflint	for good film, the lowest is 7.
2016-01-22 19:59:00	Mothravka	Tarr is through with directing though.
2016-01-22 19:59:23	RyanSmallwood	that's why I said he should direct a star wars
2016-01-22 19:59:26	Mothravka	Does a movie have to have a script?
2016-01-22 19:59:32	RyanSmallwood	but alas its not meant to be
2016-01-22 19:59:37	Mothravka	Oh.
2016-01-22 19:59:48	RyanSmallwood	mad max didn't have a script
2016-01-22 19:59:48	Mothravka	But yeah, he should do it.
2016-01-22 19:59:56	RyanSmallwood	well it technically did, but not a real one
2016-01-22 20:01:05	RyanSmallwood	it was all storyboarded out instead, and they only wrote a script later because they had to for the producers
2016-01-22 20:03:06	tomflint	Mothravka: for bullshit TV movies, yes
2016-01-22 20:03:17	Mothravka	Heh.
2016-01-22 20:04:18	tomflint	anyway, that's my take on Mad Max after the second proper viewing --

2016-01-22 20:05:35	tomflint	at least they didn't have a Tina Turner cameo
2016-01-22 20:05:51	Mothravka	So, are you looking forward to the new Mad Max movies?
2016-01-22 20:06:27	RyanSmallwood	I'm looking forward to more mad max, but I have to wait
2016-01-22 20:06:38	RyanSmallwood	I hope George Miller gets to direct all of the movies
2016-01-22 20:07:23	Mothravka	Not me.
2016-01-22 20:07:30	Mothravka	I hope it will be Michael Haneke.

2016-01-22 20:07:48	tomflint	they announced the new one -- The Wasteland
2016-01-22 20:11:00	tomflint	this whole 'no black people nominated for Oscars' thing is interesting ---
2016-01-22 20:11:25	Mothravka	Not really.
2016-01-22 20:11:36	tomflint	well, its funny that its just coming up now --
2016-01-22 20:11:53	tomflint	last year The Weeknd and Spike Lee were the only ones given anything
2016-01-22 20:11:55	@Carson	we were talking about that earlier, I don't know if most people agree but it's not the fault of the Academy really
2016-01-22 20:12:19	RyanSmallwood	they're taking action anyways though
2016-01-22 20:12:23	Mothravka	Hollywood. Does one need to say more?
2016-01-22 20:12:27	RyanSmallwood	I think its a mix
2016-01-22 20:12:27	@Carson	more about the film industry
2016-01-22 20:12:31	RyanSmallwood	it happens subtly at all levels
2016-01-22 20:12:37	tomflint	in 2014, Selma got two awards --
2016-01-22 20:12:42	@Carson	most films that come out have white lead actors
2016-01-22 20:13:37	tomflint	in the past few years the only black people to win won for films that dealt with racism
2016-01-22 20:14:12	tomflint	well, at least nominated
2016-01-22 20:14:25	tomflint	there haven't been that many wins
2016-01-22 20:14:46	@Carson	staight out of compton is getting a nomination for original screenplay, but I think it's white guys who wrote it
2016-01-22 20:14:53	@Carson	Chris Rock is hosting the Oscars

2016-01-22 20:16:45	tomflint	with 63.2% of people in the US being white and only 12.2% being black, its not surprising that there are so few nominations

2016-01-22 21:19:22	tomflint	its a shame it was cut --

2016-01-22 21:21:09	@Carson	it had the highest rated series premiere in AMC network history - before Walking Dead
2016-01-22 21:21:20	@Carson	but then the ratings went downhill I guess
2016-01-22 21:22:02	tomflint	I've watched it twice. I really like it -- I like secret societies and stuff
2016-01-22 21:22:12	tomflint	I wanted more code breaking too
2016-01-22 21:22:19	tomflint	like, the crossword was wicked.

2016-01-23 11:52:20	Mothravka	RyanSmallwood: The Stone Wedding (1972) was good!
2016-01-23 11:52:27	RyanSmallwood	yay! :)
2016-01-23 11:53:06	Mothravka	And it had some great singing too!

2016-01-23 11:53:50	RyanSmallwood	yup!
2016-01-23 11:55:21	Mothravka	It somehow reminded me of A Spring for the Thirsty (1965), mostly the first part, the rural life and depiction, some singing and some similar imagery.
2016-01-23 11:57:56	RyanSmallwood	I'm on the fence about Yuri IIyenko as a director, he's got some wonderful visuals though.  Still need to see The White Bird Marked with Black and a lot more of the Ukranian poetic school
2016-01-23 11:59:55	Mothravka	I haven't seen that one yet! I really like A Spring for the Thirsty (1965), but The Eve of Ivan Kupalo (1968) is quite bad. And they are very different movies.
2016-01-23 12:01:07	RyanSmallwood	yeah I liked A Spring for the Thirsty more than The Eve of Ivan Kupalo, but Ivan had some great cinematography and I'm hoping since The White Bird Marked with Black is his most famous film it will combine the strengths of the other two
2016-01-23 12:02:04	Mothravka	The Eve of Ivan Kupalo (1968) sure had some beautiful cinematography now and then.
2016-01-23 12:02:28	Mothravka	Then I guess I'm hoping that too!
2016-01-23 12:05:09	Mothravka	Come to think of it, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1I1TjtoK54 is a song that would be totally amazing with some poetic imagery in a movie, something rural and Bulgarian.
2016-01-23 12:05:10		[ http://is.gd/P7UwE8 ]
2016-01-23 12:06:04	RyanSmallwood	its kind of funnysupposedly Parajanov changed his cinematography style because one of his friends told him Shadows of the Forgotten Ancestors was only good because of Yuri Ilyenko's cinematography, but I think much better directed to me than Ivan Kupalo, Forgotten Ancestors also has great  songs.
2016-01-23 12:07:11	Mothravka	Good movie, but doesn't beat The Color of Pomegranates (1969) in my opinion. That is a beautiful film! Wow.

2016-01-23 12:08:54	RyanSmallwood	I'm the reverse, I love the visuals of The Color of Pomegranates, but for me Shadows of the Forgotten Ancestors is the better overall experience
2016-01-23 12:09:08	RyanSmallwood	I'm still a bit of conventional in my tastes
2016-01-23 12:09:31	Mothravka	Interesting!

2016-01-23 12:10:53		[ http://is.gd/a4RVuA ]
2016-01-23 12:10:57	Mothravka	I should see that one soon.
2016-01-23 12:11:12	Mothravka	I heard it's a bit similar to Parajanov's style.
2016-01-23 12:15:50	RyanSmallwood	This might not be your type of film, but if you're curious to see a kung fu film with a lot of folk music and dancing try out Huang Feng's The Himalayan.
2016-01-23 12:17:48	Mothravka	I just put it on my Hong Kong list, which I realized I didn't have at first, so I had to make one!

2016-01-23 17:44:20	RyanSmallwood	just people who only want to read, or do they have a bunch of channels open that they forget to check?
2016-01-23 17:44:38	RyanSmallwood	what makes one start lurking....
2016-01-23 17:44:57	@indeedwatson	probably the latter
2016-01-23 17:45:24	@indeedwatson	maybe they stop talking in one channel and are too lazy to remove from the autoconnect list
2016-01-23 17:45:29	thewillmatic__	i think they’re people who either aren’t chatty to begin with, or just have a tangential interest in film so they join the channel to just read occasionally and pick up stuff we talk about
2016-01-23 17:46:04	@indeedwatson	based on my general irc experience, that must be the minority of lurkers
2016-01-23 17:46:50	thewillmatic__	that’s only based off my experience from when i lurked a channel devoted to house music and another of torrents… just to learn about the culture. observe i guess.
2016-01-23 17:47:18	RyanSmallwood	I should lurk in a philosophy irc channel....
2016-01-23 17:47:37	@indeedwatson	will you be able to hold yourself back from discussing?
2016-01-23 17:47:42	@indeedwatson	if you find a good one let me know
2016-01-23 17:47:52	@indeedwatson	i should do the same on music channels until i find one i like
2016-01-23 17:48:03	thewillmatic__	im sure there’s some good ones around
2016-01-23 17:49:06	RyanSmallwood	and I can hold back from discussing lots of philosophy if I have no experience with a thinker or a topic
2016-01-23 17:58:45	RyanSmallwood	I guess the problem on listening into philosophical discussion is finding discussion at your level and interest
2016-01-23 17:59:13	@indeedwatson	well that applies to everything

2016-01-23 19:39:24	scarlett-	lol some of the reviews don't seem good
2016-01-23 19:39:32	scarlett-	"I really tried to enjoy this, I love Michael Fassbender. But I'm not familiar with Shakespear and as an english speaker watching this movie in English I could not understand a single word.
2016-01-23 19:39:32	scarlett-	If you aren't familiar with Shakespeare and don't understand his meandering version of the English language you won't understand this movie."
2016-01-23 19:39:52	scarlett-	i don't understand shakespearian either
2016-01-23 19:39:55	kerozene	totally forgot about macbeth

2016-01-23 19:40:55	@indeedwatson	not sure if in english
2016-01-23 19:40:57	scarlett-	the original english is really hard for me to understand
2016-01-23 19:41:05	scarlett-	modern ones have 'modern english' translations
2016-01-23 19:41:11	scarlett-	the original english doesnt even look like english
2016-01-23 19:41:15	@indeedwatson	well, the way they actually talked is even harder to understand
2016-01-23 19:41:23	thewillmatic__	is shakespeare like the casablance of the literary world?

2016-01-23 20:15:15	RyanSmallwood	I really dig the Imamura I've seen so far, want to see more of his films
2016-01-23 20:15:17	Porkepik	Weirdly, the list makes me go from movie quite "modern" and "clean" (Hiroshima, Mon Amour/ La Notte etc ...) to very "wild" and "dirty" films (Marketa Lazarova/Profound Desires of the Gods)
2016-01-23 20:15:18	AlexJ44	his homework?

2016-01-23 20:16:18	scarlett-	i mean die before this movie came out?
2016-01-23 20:16:21	AlexJ44	are you watching tons of shorts?
2016-01-23 20:16:22	Porkepik	Mostly shorts
2016-01-23 20:16:29	scarlett-	also this movie was on tarantinos top movies of 2013 list haha
2016-01-23 20:16:39	AlexJ44	ah I see
2016-01-23 20:16:39	scarlett-	speaking of ebert, has anyone seen the movie Elizabethtown
2016-01-23 20:17:01	AlexJ44	ah man, I really want to watch a movie now but I can't
2016-01-23 20:17:09	Porkepik	18 feature films this year
2016-01-23 20:17:16	Porkepik	(if you count Sherlock Jr.)
2016-01-23 20:17:25	RyanSmallwood	by the by Porkepik I won't ask you about every short from my shorts list, but any your particularly enjoyed so far?
2016-01-23 20:17:41	scarlett-	Elizabethtown seems like a basic romantic comedy at first, and much later on someone sent a letter to ebert which he reposted where he said i feel like every critic has missed out on what the movie was doing
2016-01-23 20:17:49	scarlett-	and it's pretty cool... it's like a twist almost
2016-01-23 20:18:01	scarlett-	but when you watch it it's pretty obvious that that's what the director had in mind
2016-01-23 20:18:43	Porkepik	The Sinking of the Lusitania was interesting, I like how he always starts his short by explaining what he did
2016-01-23 20:18:53	Porkepik	But it was mixed with german hate, kinda weird :/
2016-01-23 20:18:58	scarlett-	oh btw i watched all three of the matrix movies with the philosophers commentary, it is really really good!
2016-01-23 20:19:09	Porkepik	Was a bit uncomfortable to watch, cause it looked like propaganda
2016-01-23 20:19:10	scarlett-	especially if you are a philosophy major or just into philosophy
2016-01-23 20:19:39	Porkepik	For "The Musketeers of Pig Alley", I didn't get much of the story, was quite confusing, but fun
2016-01-23 20:19:52	Porkepik	"An Unseen Enemy" is my favorite Griffith short
2016-01-23 20:19:56	Porkepik	(so far)
2016-01-23 20:20:12	RyanSmallwood	Porkepik: yeah films made around wartime don't always have the most nuanced things to say about the enemy
2016-01-23 20:20:30	Porkepik	"Suspense" was kinda uncomfortable too, since I have a fear with home invasion

2016-01-23 20:22:16	AlexJ44	I haven't seen either elizabethtown or the matrix
2016-01-23 20:22:37	RyanSmallwood	Segundo de Chomón also worked in a lot of important films after he stopped directing trick films, helping with cinematography and effects on films like Cabiria and Napoleon
2016-01-23 20:28:07	RyanSmallwood	I might trim down my silent recommendation list
2016-01-23 20:29:46	Mothravka	I want to rewatch Eros Plus Massacre (1969) again, heh.
2016-01-23 20:30:30	Porkepik	Yeah, I have the DVD (no bluray ? blasphemy !) box out, I'm gonna start it soon
2016-01-23 20:30:50	Mothravka	Box?
2016-01-23 20:30:58	Porkepik	I don't know
2016-01-23 20:31:04	Porkepik	not like box
2016-01-23 20:31:21	Mothravka	Oh, you mean case?
2016-01-23 20:31:25	Porkepik	Yeah, that
2016-01-23 20:31:36	Porkepik	That's a cool word, I will try to remember it
2016-01-23 20:32:08	Porkepik	So wait, wasn't I supposed to read about a guy before watching it ?
2016-01-23 20:32:12	Porkepik	Who was it ?
2016-01-23 20:32:38	Mothravka	Sakae Ōsugi.
2016-01-23 20:32:38	Porkepik	Sakae Ōsugi ?
2016-01-23 20:33:19	Porkepik	Can I just read the wikipedia page or I want to isolate myself and study his life with monks on a mountain in Tibet ?
2016-01-23 20:33:46	Porkepik	or I have to*
2016-01-23 20:33:48	Mothravka	You can read the Wikipedia page.
2016-01-23 20:33:53	Porkepik	Cool
2016-01-23 20:34:21	Porkepik	"and created Japan's first Esperanto school in 1906" That's when you know they're anarchist
2016-01-23 20:35:24	Mothravka	You don't need to it for enjoying the movie, but I really recommend it if you want to understand the movie a lot better and getting to know the characters involved in everything, it certainly helps.
2016-01-23 20:35:30	Porkepik	"They were later beaten to death and their bodies thrown into a well." K, that's fucked up
2016-01-23 20:35:40	Mothravka	Politics!
2016-01-23 20:35:44	@indeedwatson	yeah i wish i read that before
2016-01-23 20:38:06	RyanSmallwood	me too
2016-01-23 20:39:15	Mothravka	If you don't have any knowledge about him or some of the other characters and all the happenings, it's very easy to get lost, especially because the movie jumps back and forth between the present, the past and the future as well as combining them together.
2016-01-23 20:39:36	@indeedwatson	but i guess i'll read that before a rewatch, if the brrip comes out :)
2016-01-23 20:39:54	Mothravka	Hope it doesn't. Heh!
2016-01-23 20:40:21	Porkepik	"and completed his transition to socialist" That sounds like some sort of pokemon evolution or dragon ball transformation
2016-01-23 20:40:26	@indeedwatson	you don't want me to watch it in full hd!
2016-01-23 20:40:46	Mothravka	I do, but I want you to buy the beautiful Blu-ray box set!
2016-01-23 20:41:14	Mothravka	And speaking of the mixing and jumping, there's also two different time periods on top of everything.
2016-01-23 20:41:22	Porkepik	"He also taught himself languages including Italian, Esperanto, Russian, English, French, and German." It's Japanese Ryan ! :O
2016-01-23 20:41:45	Mothravka	Heh!
2016-01-23 20:42:00	@indeedwatson	that will likely never happen
2016-01-23 20:44:17	RyanSmallwood	I would never study Esperanto

2016-01-23 20:44:44	Porkepik	How did he get to France, it's not explained :O
2016-01-23 20:45:08	Porkepik	I guess he just traveled and there isn't more to know about it
2016-01-23 20:45:45	Mothravka	Yeah, he travelled there.
2016-01-23 20:45:54	Mothravka	Using a false passport, heh.

2016-01-23 20:48:36	Mothravka	By the way, the reason he travelled to France was because he wanted to participate in the International Congress of Anarchists which was to be held in Berlin in the following year.
2016-01-23 20:48:55	Porkepik	Yoshida is still alive !
2016-01-23 20:49:04	Mothravka	I know!
2016-01-23 20:49:07	Porkepik	I really liked the first movie of his I watched
2016-01-23 20:49:20	Mothravka	He's done several good films.
2016-01-23 20:49:29	Porkepik	A story written with water I think the name is

2016-01-23 20:50:07	Mothravka	You mean the first one you watched?
2016-01-23 20:50:24	RyanSmallwood	Mizu de kakareta monogatari

2016-01-23 20:52:16	Mothravka	My English is not the best either, but I always ask if I get confused over something, that way we usually understand each other perfectly.
2016-01-23 20:52:39	Porkepik	Yeah, better that way
2016-01-23 20:52:57	Mothravka	Indeed. Especially when we are talking about Yoshida!
2016-01-23 20:53:23	RyanSmallwood	Mizu = water,  de = through/with , kakareta = written, monogatari = story

2016-01-23 20:55:02	Mothravka	Exciting!
2016-01-23 20:58:00	Mothravka	I'm guessing that Porkepik will like the movie, at least.
2016-01-23 20:59:40	RyanSmallwood	I think the only movie he didn't like was L'Avventura

2016-01-24 13:45:04	RyanSmallwood	more my favorite hitchcock films, other might disagree on what is major or not
2016-01-24 13:50:37	Porkepik	Do you mean that you don't have absolute knowledge about movies ? D:
2016-01-24 13:51:33	RyanSmallwood	not until I finish reading Hegel and grasp the spirit of history
2016-01-24 14:08:28	Porkepik	I'm gonna add Dial M for Murder to your list so it's 14
2016-01-24 14:08:56	Porkepik	Unless you think there a 14th more interesting film
2016-01-24 14:13:59	RyanSmallwood	yeah I dunno, there are tons of films I could add in the "interesting but not great" category like Rope and Lifeboat
2016-01-24 14:14:22	RyanSmallwood	I'll add The Trouble With Harry, which I haven't seen, but is Hitchcock's favorite of his own films, and supposedly the film you need to watch to understand hitchcock
2016-01-24 14:14:39	RyanSmallwood	and I'll assign myself watching it as well
2016-01-24 14:16:42	Mothravka	I think Rope (1948) is one of his better too, quite essential as well!
2016-01-24 14:18:32	RyanSmallwood	its meant to be a starter kit no an exhaustive hitchcock trip
2016-01-24 14:18:49	RyanSmallwood	there's lots of hitchcock films that are essential to get around to eventually
2016-01-24 14:21:21	Porkepik	If the Hitchcock week is a success, I will extend it to a Hitchcock month (without actually watching 2 movies of his every day but focusing on the rest)
2016-01-24 14:22:45	RyanSmallwood	yeah the point isn't to list all the hitchcock films worth watching, I assume after you watch a few you'll naturally seek out more, its meant to be a systematic introduction to some materpieces through every phase of his career
2016-01-24 14:32:57	@indeedwatson	RyanSmallwood: what do you think of Waking Life
2016-01-24 14:34:57	RyanSmallwood	been a long time since I've watched it
2016-01-24 14:35:22	RyanSmallwood	I thought it was entertaining to watch, not sure if the ideas are that interesting
2016-01-24 14:38:25	RyanSmallwood	isn't it mostly about lucid dreaming? Or is there more than I forgot?
2016-01-24 14:51:28	@indeedwatson	yeah but there's some philosophy discussion

2016-01-24 17:50:24	RyanSmallwood	once the first few are done, I'll have a better handle on my process and hopefully I'll start getting faster

2016-01-24 22:09:35	@indeedwatson	Samsara stone was the greatest visual experience of my life
2016-01-24 22:09:40	scarlett	oh ya thats a great movie
2016-01-24 22:09:44	@indeedwatson	stoned*
2016-01-24 22:09:46	thewillmatic__	indeedwatson: thats a good idea actually
2016-01-24 22:09:53	scarlett	cinematography 💯
2016-01-24 22:09:59	thewillmatic__	all those films. bakara and qatsi
2016-01-24 22:10:11	scarlett	i liked samsara more than baraka
2016-01-24 22:10:19	@indeedwatson	there's a bunch of films i want to rewatch high
2016-01-24 22:10:19	scarlett	the cinematography at least
2016-01-24 22:10:24	@indeedwatson	yeah me too
2016-01-24 22:10:34	scarlett	but most people say baraka is a better film
2016-01-24 22:10:39	scarlett	have you seen a scanner darkly?
2016-01-24 22:10:44	scarlett	i love watching that movie high
2016-01-24 22:10:49	@indeedwatson	i have, but long ago
2016-01-24 22:10:52	scarlett	it's a great movie too imo i love the dialogue
2016-01-24 22:10:53	@indeedwatson	same with waking life
2016-01-24 22:11:01	scarlett	i need to see that
2016-01-24 22:11:09	scarlett	the rotoscoped brother of a scanner darkly
2016-01-24 22:11:16	tomflint	you should do acid and watch Enter the Void
2016-01-24 22:11:22	RyanSmallwood	I should re-watch waking life
2016-01-24 22:11:30	tomflint	then when you get out of rehab... well...
2016-01-24 22:11:35	@indeedwatson	tomflint: i would gladly, haven't seen that movie, been putting it off
2016-01-24 22:11:44	tomflint	oh man -- don't watch it on drugs!
2016-01-24 22:11:48	RyanSmallwood	I don't find movies with surreal/hallucinatory imagery to work well stoned, its almost like trying to double the effect
2016-01-24 22:11:48	@indeedwatson	and i never watched a movie on acid
2016-01-24 22:11:50	tomflint	it would fuck you up
2016-01-24 22:12:01	RyanSmallwood	Waynes World works better with drugs than "trippy movies"
2016-01-24 22:12:01	tomflint	its such a crazy movie
2016-01-24 22:12:26	@indeedwatson	i thought the creepy performance art dude would fuck me up in samsara
2016-01-24 22:12:29	@indeedwatson	but i loved it
2016-01-24 22:12:36	@indeedwatson	RyanSmallwood: isn't that basically a stoner movie tho?
2016-01-24 22:12:48	RyanSmallwood	yup and its designed for stoners
2016-01-24 22:13:00	@indeedwatson	inherent vice stoned would be fun
2016-01-24 22:13:03	scarlett	i'm not too into stoner filsm personally
2016-01-24 22:13:09	RyanSmallwood	the assumption that hallucinatory imagery = even better with drugs, hasn't held up in my experience
2016-01-24 22:13:19	tomflint	have you guys ever watched The Dark Side of Oz?
2016-01-24 22:13:28	@indeedwatson	no
2016-01-24 22:13:34	scarlett	i want to do drugs and go to a hindu temple
2016-01-24 22:13:41	scarlett	and look at the statues and shrines and stuff
2016-01-24 22:13:50	@indeedwatson	RyanSmallwood: to me it's like staring at the fire while high
2016-01-24 22:13:56	@indeedwatson	it's just mesmerizing
2016-01-24 22:14:10	RyanSmallwood	you don't need drugs to enjoy Bruce Bickford https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1tx8mEie-o he supplies them in the experience

2016-01-24 22:16:09	scarlett	oh guys
2016-01-24 22:16:15	scarlett	so has everyone seen the holy mountain?
2016-01-24 22:16:21	@indeedwatson	i have
2016-01-24 22:16:22	RyanSmallwood	yup yup
2016-01-24 22:16:22	uguuuu	ye
2016-01-24 22:16:24	@indeedwatson	but only sober
2016-01-24 22:16:29	scarlett	nice
2016-01-24 22:16:32	scarlett	what are your guys thoughts on it
2016-01-24 22:16:37	@indeedwatson	i loved it
2016-01-24 22:16:51	scarlett	it's very cool
2016-01-24 22:16:55	RyanSmallwood	I like Jodorowsky, but I prefer Santa Sangre and El Topo over Holy Mountain
2016-01-24 22:17:05	scarlett	i saw about half of el topo
2016-01-24 22:17:07	@indeedwatson	i didn't like el topo that much
2016-01-24 22:17:09	scarlett	really cool too
2016-01-24 22:17:19	RyanSmallwood	Holy Mountain has the best visuals, but on re-watching I don't get as much out of it as his others
2016-01-24 22:17:23	@indeedwatson	i mean i liked it, but not nearly as much as holy mountain
2016-01-24 22:18:05	scarlett	if i rewatch one of them can we have a discussion about it perhaps?
2016-01-24 22:18:29	@indeedwatson	sounds good
2016-01-24 22:18:38	@indeedwatson	i've yet to watch santa sangre
2016-01-24 22:18:46	RyanSmallwood	thats my favorite :)
2016-01-24 22:18:51	@indeedwatson	scarlett: seen jodorowsky's dune?
2016-01-24 22:21:13	RyanSmallwood	hah, put Santa Sangre on your list indeedwatson
2016-01-24 22:23:12	@indeedwatson	RyanSmallwood: :D
2016-01-24 22:25:01	scarlett	indeedwatson: ya i have
2016-01-24 22:25:13	scarlett	pretty cool
2016-01-24 22:25:40	RyanSmallwood	(I'm glad Lynch directed it in the end)
2016-01-24 22:25:53	scarlett	:O
2016-01-24 22:26:07	scarlett	i havent seen it
2016-01-24 22:26:10	scarlett	but i heard it wasnt good
2016-01-24 22:26:22	RyanSmallwood	hah, its very cheesy, but its also everything wonderful in the world
2016-01-24 22:26:38	scarlett	i heard they are thinking about animating it
2016-01-24 22:26:41	scarlett	jodorosky's dune
2016-01-24 22:26:43	@indeedwatson	even jodorowsky said he was happy that it was crap haha
2016-01-24 22:26:47	@indeedwatson	scarlett: that'd rock
2016-01-24 22:26:50	scarlett	ya
2016-01-24 22:26:58	scarlett	the doc sparked a lot of interest in it
2016-01-24 22:27:14	scarlett	and in modern times you dont have to rely on big studios to make your ideas
2016-01-24 22:27:34	RyanSmallwood	there's also problems with the 2 edits of Lynch's Dune  that have been released, the fan edits improve the film a  lot
2016-01-24 22:27:35	scarlett	for a movie like that, live action would cost a ton
2016-01-24 22:27:51	scarlett	but you can probably do  a lot when it's animated without breaking the bank that much
2016-01-24 22:28:00	scarlett	oh cool
2016-01-24 22:28:01	scarlett	oh guys
2016-01-24 22:28:06	scarlett	so have you heard of the darth jar jar theory?
2016-01-24 22:28:20	RyanSmallwood	I don't pay attention to fan theories
2016-01-24 22:28:27	scarlett	me neither
2016-01-24 22:28:32	scarlett	well
2016-01-24 22:28:36	scarlett	i don't seek them out
2016-01-24 22:28:43	scarlett	i was reading antoher thread but it was referenced,
2016-01-24 22:28:49	scarlett	so i checked it out, and it's really good
2016-01-24 22:28:58	@indeedwatson	i have
2016-01-24 22:29:05	scarlett	in the sense i don't think it's a 'fan theory'
2016-01-24 22:29:17	scarlett	like these things about seinfeld and friends being in the same universe etc
2016-01-24 22:29:26	scarlett	like it seems very plausible this is what lucas planned
2016-01-24 22:29:46	RyanSmallwood	its a theory that some fans wrote up, no?
2016-01-24 22:29:47	@indeedwatson	i would not go that far
2016-01-24 22:30:20	@indeedwatson	RyanSmallwood: afair it was one guy on reddit with a lot of proof, showing gifs and sections of the prequels
2016-01-24 22:30:33	@indeedwatson	but i dont believe lucas to be so subtle, AND so quiet about it all these years
2016-01-24 22:30:38	scarlett	by saying it's not a fan thoery
2016-01-24 22:30:53	scarlett	i meant like it seems a lot more credible than other fan theories which are usually really out there theories
2016-01-24 22:31:00	@indeedwatson	and it's not like it's a deep theory really worth hiding so much anyway imo
2016-01-24 22:31:03	scarlett	that are very unlikely to be real but are interesting as thought experiments
2016-01-24 22:31:16	scarlett	i dont think he did it
2016-01-24 22:31:23	scarlett	*hid
2016-01-24 22:31:31	scarlett	he could have just made the change in episode 32
2016-01-24 22:31:32	scarlett	*2
2016-01-24 22:31:38	@indeedwatson	he's never talked about it, has he?
2016-01-24 22:31:48	scarlett	i'm not sure if anyone asked him
2016-01-24 22:31:55	scarlett	there's also this robot chicken clip which alludes to it
2016-01-24 22:31:56	@indeedwatson	and it's taken how many years for someone to write something up on it
2016-01-24 22:32:04	@indeedwatson	i'd call that hidden
2016-01-24 22:32:06	RyanSmallwood	if its speculating on plot elements that don't readily present themselves as part of the narrative experience of a normal viewing, I'm not interested
2016-01-24 22:32:15	scarlett	what?
2016-01-24 22:32:23	scarlett	they do readily present themselves
2016-01-24 22:32:40	scarlett	an example of this happening is in that movie Elizabethtown indeedwatson
2016-01-24 22:32:55	@indeedwatson	he's been attacked a lot for the prequels, he could at least say "guys there's actual subtlety that you missed"
2016-01-24 22:32:57	scarlett	where it seemed most people missed the premise of the movie since it was billed as mostly a romcom of sorts
2016-01-24 22:33:08	@indeedwatson	scarlett: im not familiar with that movie
2016-01-24 22:33:11	scarlett	indeedwatson: well the theory doesnt go like that
2016-01-24 22:33:22	scarlett	its more like he wanted jar jar to be the evil yoda counterpoart
2016-01-24 22:33:31	scarlett	that was his plan and his role does fulfill that
2016-01-24 22:33:43	scarlett	except that he chicked out and made this quick character dooku
2016-01-24 22:33:50	scarlett	for the ep 2 main baddie
2016-01-24 22:34:20	@indeedwatson	i just honestly can't give him that much credit 
2016-01-24 22:34:20	scarlett	the rset of the role of jar jar seems to indicate that he could easily be an evil character
2016-01-24 22:34:30	RyanSmallwood	I think someone wrote up an article on how all the prequels needed to be good, was for the Jedi to actually be kind of stuck in their ways and oppressive so we actually identified with Anakin wanting to break away
2016-01-24 22:34:40	RyanSmallwood	*repressive
2016-01-24 22:34:49	@indeedwatson	scarlett: weren't the screencaps from all the ep?
2016-01-24 22:34:52	scarlett	it's barely anything to give someone
2016-01-24 22:34:54	@indeedwatson	or just from ep 1?
2016-01-24 22:35:02	scarlett	no it was from ep 1 2 and 3
2016-01-24 22:35:17	scarlett	jar jar was an expensive and important char

2016-01-24 22:35:45	scarlett	its weird to assume he wouldnt try for a twist
2016-01-24 22:35:50	scarlett	that made his first trilogy so successful
2016-01-24 22:36:06	scarlett	and he has talked extensively about the storytelling idea
2016-01-24 22:36:16	scarlett	of introducing an inncoent character who turns out to be very important later on
2016-01-24 22:36:34	scarlett	and he said thats exactly what he went for with yoda

2016-01-25 18:11:06	RyanSmallwood	hah
2016-01-25 18:11:06	@indeedwatson	im researching joan of arc soundtracks, i thought people would find and share existing music that they think would fit, but there's not much on it
2016-01-25 18:11:24	AlexJ44	IIRC there's like three diferent soundtracks to that
2016-01-25 18:12:29	RyanSmallwood	yeah, probably won't be a definitive soundtrack until it gets an official blu-ray restoration in France and on the Criterion collection
2016-01-25 18:12:36	@indeedwatson	there's many more in wikipedia, but i wanted something with older music
2016-01-25 18:12:43	RyanSmallwood	Voices of Light = Criterion soundtrack
2016-01-25 18:12:59	@indeedwatson	and there's a group that does live presentations with their own selection of 15 century french music
2016-01-25 18:13:14	@indeedwatson	but it's hard to find the whole list of pieces they used
2016-01-25 18:13:25	@indeedwatson	let alone try to sync them with the movie :p
2016-01-25 18:13:26	RyanSmallwood	Masters of cinema has "a piano score performed by Japanese silent film composer Mie Yanashita (for the 20fps option), and a radical accompaniment by esteemed American avant-garde musician Loren Connors (for the 24fps option)"
2016-01-25 18:13:44	@indeedwatson	yeah i think i'll do voices of light
2016-01-25 18:13:59	RyanSmallwood	or you could do absolutely silent O_O
2016-01-25 18:14:09	@indeedwatson	it'd neat to search for a piece that fits on my own, but i haven't even seen it once
2016-01-25 18:15:24	RyanSmallwood	voices of light is weird cause I think it was conceived as a musical performance that would have Joan of Arc playing in the background
2016-01-25 18:15:41	RyanSmallwood	like when people went to see it, it was primarily to hear the music, not to see Joan of Arc with a score

2016-01-25 18:17:42	RyanSmallwood	come to think of it I think I've only ever watched it with Voices of Light or  completely silent
2016-01-25 18:18:04	@indeedwatson	also, apparently that thing about Dreyer wanting the film to be viewed silent isn't completely true, more that he said there hadn't been so far a score that he found appropriate
2016-01-25 18:18:23	@indeedwatson	so who knows, perhaps the one i mentioned with music that joan of arc would have hear in her time, he would find fitting
2016-01-25 18:18:48	@indeedwatson	I'm excited to watch it but the brrip is taking so long to download
2016-01-25 18:20:45	RyanSmallwood	hah, just read the article on the score
2016-01-25 18:20:52	RyanSmallwood	funny that the myth has been perpetuated so long
2016-01-25 18:21:05	RyanSmallwood	and all DVDs have a silent option because of it
2016-01-25 18:21:42	@indeedwatson	i think they even blame bordwell for the perpetuation

2016-01-25 21:01:10	@Carson	yeah my family was watching the new episode last night
2016-01-25 21:01:19	@Carson	they never watched the original though
2016-01-25 21:01:39	@indeedwatson	im like fuck star wars, this is the nostalgic comback for me
2016-01-25 21:01:50	@indeedwatson	im gonna try to like it and not watch it analytically
2016-01-25 21:01:50	@Carson	from what I saw it looked pretty campy, but that's the point I guess
2016-01-25 21:02:21	@Carson	I started liking Star Trek the Next Generation in December, that what my fuck star wars moment
2016-01-25 21:02:47	@Carson	I think watching the x-files in a binge is a bit too depressing for me
2016-01-25 21:02:52	@indeedwatson	it's really weird that they put joel mchale in there
2016-01-25 21:02:52	@Carson	so I never finished it
2016-01-25 21:02:58	@Carson	yeah I saw that
2016-01-25 21:03:26	@indeedwatson	the last time i binge watched xfiles was in very low res avi files, i'd stay late watching 4 or 5 ep in a row
2016-01-25 21:03:33	@Carson	I saw it in the cast info intro after the opening sequence and then saw his character intro
2016-01-25 21:03:43	@Carson	didn't care that much though
2016-01-25 21:05:50	@indeedwatson	i just hope they dont spend too much time on setting everything back up and just jump right in like it's a normal episode

2016-01-25 21:48:57	RyanSmallwood	I haven't seen it, but it seems like a film that's worth seeing and having an opinion on
2016-01-25 21:49:38	@indeedwatson	can't that be said of most of Kaufman's work
2016-01-25 21:49:45	RyanSmallwood	I should probably watch more oscar contenders, but right now it looks like I'll just bury my head in the sand and hope that Mad Max or The Revenant sweeps
2016-01-25 21:50:32	RyanSmallwood	ehh I think Kaufman is at least worth watching even if its not your thing (back to this argument again)
2016-01-25 21:51:30	@indeedwatson	what argument? did we talk about Kaufman before?

2016-01-25 21:58:29	@Carson	I don't care about them that much, it's just fun to guess
2016-01-25 21:59:22	RyanSmallwood	does it kind of take the steam out of Chris Rock admonishing them for being bad white people if they're all bending over waiting to be spanked?

2016-01-26 21:08:32	@indeedwatson	except bob
2016-01-26 21:08:39	RyanSmallwood	I've only every watched up until the season 1 plot gets resolved
2016-01-26 21:08:43	RyanSmallwood	*ever
2016-01-26 21:08:48	@indeedwatson	really?
2016-01-26 21:08:52	RyanSmallwood	yup :)
2016-01-26 21:09:01	@indeedwatson	that explains why you think so highly of it ;)
2016-01-26 21:09:12	RyanSmallwood	hahaha, lots of shows require you to stop at some point
2016-01-26 21:09:19	RyanSmallwood	before the show officially ends
2016-01-26 21:09:28	RyanSmallwood	I'll probably finish it before the reboot just to be safe
2016-01-26 21:09:39	@indeedwatson	but you can't judge it as if it finished where you wished it did!
2016-01-26 21:09:47	@indeedwatson	did you not watch the movie either?
2016-01-26 21:09:53	RyanSmallwood	not yet
2016-01-26 21:10:01	RyanSmallwood	thats just laziness
2016-01-26 21:10:05	RyanSmallwood	*my laziness
2016-01-26 21:10:23	RyanSmallwood	and TV shows you can totally judge based on a certain range if they have a suitable ending point
2016-01-26 21:10:55	RyanSmallwood	the fact Community goes on for several seasons doesn't hinder how well contained the first 3 seasons are
2016-01-26 21:11:22	@indeedwatson	i disagree! otherwise, if one can exclude the end, why can't one exclude the beginning? and by that token you can say a show is great based on one episode alone
2016-01-26 21:11:47	@indeedwatson	but it does hinder the quality of the show as a whole
2016-01-26 21:11:57	tomflint	Abe Vigoda died
2016-01-26 21:12:01	@indeedwatson	who?
2016-01-26 21:12:19	RyanSmallwood	my only concern is about if there's a solid chunk of story that I can call good without cutting off parts
2016-01-26 21:12:31	tomflint	a fantastic actor --- he was Tessio in the Godfather
2016-01-26 21:12:31	RyanSmallwood	if there's a beginning part that doesn't effect later episodes that's fine
2016-01-26 21:12:45	RyanSmallwood	if there's a single episode that works by itself that's fine
2016-01-26 21:13:01	@indeedwatson	i get that, but i think it's unfair to call it the best show ever based on one section of it 
2016-01-26 21:14:36	RyanSmallwood	if I'm every appointed judge of some best TV shows of all time thing I'll worry about that
2016-01-26 21:15:02	RyanSmallwood	if I'm just telling people what the good TV stuff is, I can totally say Twin Peaks up until the main plot line ends is better than any other TV show
2016-01-26 21:15:50	@indeedwatson	not that The Wire :)
2016-01-26 21:15:52	@indeedwatson	but fair enough

While the initial plan was to film entirely in Canada, the weather ended up being too warm, leading the filmmakers to locations at the tip of Argentina with snow on the

2016-01-27 23:14:16	thewillmatic__	oh yeah
2016-01-27 23:14:18	thewillmatic__	great anime
2016-01-27 23:14:28	thewillmatic__	wicked soundtrack too.

2016-01-27 23:20:19	thewillmatic__	now i want to download the OST hehe you reminded me of some great music indeedwatson
2016-01-27 23:20:42	@indeedwatson	hah, i kinda want to rewatch it to see how it holds up
2016-01-27 23:20:46	@indeedwatson	it's been so long
2016-01-27 23:21:01	thewillmatic__	same 5+ years for me
2016-01-27 23:21:33	RyanSmallwood	I watched it relatively recently, it holds up
2016-01-27 23:21:57	@indeedwatson	i was planning on rewatching evangelion too
2016-01-27 23:22:21	RyanSmallwood	:D :D :D
2016-01-27 23:22:26	RyanSmallwood	have you watched any of the new movies?
2016-01-27 23:22:45	@indeedwatson	yeah, didn't like them
2016-01-27 23:23:07	thewillmatic__	i always thought the ages in Champloo were off… Mugen/Gin looked older than 19
2016-01-27 23:23:55	RyanSmallwood	I liked parts of them, but ultimately they pushed me back to the series
2016-01-27 23:23:58	@indeedwatson	i think there's 19yos that can look like that
2016-01-27 23:24:38	@indeedwatson	yeah the rebuild just felt like eye candy and fan service to me
2016-01-27 23:24:56	thewillmatic__	yeah maybe
2016-01-27 23:30:22	@indeedwatson	space dandy is supposed to be pretty fun
2016-01-27 23:32:04	RyanSmallwood	I dunno, I think there's room to improve Evangelion, I got kind of frustrated with the 3rd movie, because there's so little time to tell the story compared to the TV show and it didn't really seem to progress anything

2016-01-27 23:38:01	@indeedwatson	f91w: i don't really think a film could do it much justice
2016-01-27 23:38:25	f91w	Of course. I'd watch it regardless.

2016-01-28 10:05:52	Mothravka	Sátántangó (1994) on Blu-ray released by Criterion would be even better, yeah.

2016-01-28 10:08:19	@indeedwatson	turns out it comes with 2 soundstracks and a commentary

2016-01-28 10:14:45	@indeedwatson	it's on yt anyway, just gotta sync it
2016-01-28 10:15:03	@indeedwatson	or do the piano score that comes with it, it seems nice
2016-01-28 10:17:37	Mothravka	I think there was some talk about it getting a Criterion Blu-ray release, together with Häxan: Witchcraft Through the Ages (1922). Let's hope it will happen soon.
2016-01-28 10:18:01	@indeedwatson	how do they decide that
2016-01-28 10:18:10	@indeedwatson	do they make polls to see what people want?
2016-01-28 10:18:21	Mothravka	Secret.
2016-01-28 10:18:31	Mothravka	But they don't do polls.

2016-01-28 18:24:11	RyanSmallwood	Porkepik: might want to put off watching Napoleon, 2 restorations coming out soon, the UK restoration this year and the French restoration next year
2016-01-28 18:30:54	Porkepik	But ... :(
2016-01-28 18:30:57	Porkepik	I don't like waiting
2016-01-28 18:31:41	RyanSmallwood	well if you want to watch a 5+ hour movie 3 times go for it, its a great flick :P
2016-01-28 18:32:56	RyanSmallwood	hopefully Francis Ford Coppola isn't going to screw over the French restoration too badly...
2016-01-28 18:33:09	@indeedwatson	or..... watch Band of Brothers
2016-01-28 18:33:33	Porkepik	Would be cool if it was in theater in France
2016-01-28 18:33:42	RyanSmallwood	it probably will be
2016-01-28 18:33:47	RyanSmallwood	its going to be in the UK this year
2016-01-28 18:33:52	RyanSmallwood	I imagine France will next year
2016-01-28 18:34:10	Porkepik	Now I hope I will hate La Roue and J'accuse, so I can patiently wait :D
2016-01-28 18:34:39	RyanSmallwood	you might be stuck with the Carmine Coppola score though O_O
2016-01-28 18:36:25	Porkepik	Damn ! That Coppola family still haunting the cinema industry ! :D
2016-01-28 18:37:16	RyanSmallwood	hopefully he lets them put alternate scores on the DVD
2016-01-28 18:37:32	@indeedwatson	dvd?
2016-01-28 18:37:42	RyanSmallwood	*Blu-Ray
2016-01-28 18:37:46	RyanSmallwood	I like saying dvd
2016-01-28 18:38:16	RyanSmallwood	I'm probably going to get both the BFI and Criterion release so I have the Carl Davis score and the French restordation
2016-01-28 18:38:28	Porkepik	A bluray is a DVD
2016-01-28 18:38:37	RyanSmallwood	would be sucky if the only way to watch the French restoration was with a revised Carmine Coppola score...
2016-01-28 18:42:48	Porkepik	Oh, I don't see the MGM lion that much
2016-01-28 18:42:59	Porkepik	RAWR ! What a way to start a movie

2016-01-28 18:45:58	uguuuu	woop
2016-01-28 18:46:08	uguuuu	i just watched something with the lion logo!
2016-01-28 18:47:35	Porkepik	Knowing Hitchcock, he tortured this lion to get real reactions :D
2016-01-28 18:48:06	Porkepik	Btw, I got something about Hitchcock
2016-01-28 18:48:14	RyanSmallwood	???
2016-01-28 18:48:30	Porkepik	I read somewhere about his fear of cops (and I guess, being arrested wrongly, or part of a crime that wasn't really your fault)
2016-01-28 18:48:37	Porkepik	And so far, most of his movies are on this theme
2016-01-28 18:48:51	Porkepik	Not Shadow of the Doubt, but the rest always has a character running away from the cops
2016-01-28 18:48:59	@indeedwatson	so maybe nolan is scared of his wife dying
2016-01-28 18:49:10	RyanSmallwood	yeah, that's a common thing in hitchcock
2016-01-28 18:49:17	RyanSmallwood	by the by what did you think of Rebecca and Shadow of a Doubt?
2016-01-28 18:49:29	Porkepik	Rebecca was great
2016-01-28 18:49:54	Porkepik	Weirdly, I didn't love the end as much as the rest of the movie
2016-01-28 18:50:29	Porkepik	It was still an awesome twist, the beginning was kinda cheesy, but not in an annoying way, in a cute and innoncent manner
2016-01-28 18:50:42	Porkepik	It made me smile and laugh a lot
2016-01-28 18:50:50	RyanSmallwood	:D
2016-01-28 18:50:51	Porkepik	Then I got weirdly depressed for like 2 mins somehow :(
2016-01-28 18:51:07	Porkepik	The scene after the screening of their souvenirs to Monaco
2016-01-28 18:51:25	Porkepik	I don't remember why exactly tho
2016-01-28 18:52:19	Porkepik	Honestly, I'm starting to think he is great at comedy, I don't laugh (I mean, not really vocally) that often watching movies
2016-01-28 18:52:33	Porkepik	Still a serious movie tho, nothing ridiculous
2016-01-28 18:52:43	Porkepik	Shadow of a Doubt was really more disturbing
2016-01-28 18:53:20	RyanSmallwood	yeah
2016-01-28 18:53:22	Porkepik	Quite dark, the only funny thing was the dad and his friend
2016-01-28 18:53:36	Porkepik	But ... this one was kinda frustrating to watch sometimes
2016-01-28 18:53:42	Porkepik	I mean, it didn't make much sense sometimes
2016-01-28 18:53:50	Porkepik	Like, why would he hide the newspaper article ?
2016-01-28 18:54:14	Porkepik	it's not like they're gonna be "mmmmh ... weird ... could it be our dear uncle we are now treating as a god ?"
2016-01-28 18:54:33	Porkepik	I don't really think I'm that nitpicky
2016-01-28 18:54:41	Porkepik	He was always making too much, too suspicious
2016-01-28 18:54:54	Porkepik	I guess that may be on purpose, somehow ?
2016-01-28 18:55:08	Porkepik	Like to show our "naive" the town people are ?
2016-01-28 18:55:13	Porkepik	how*
2016-01-28 18:55:51	Porkepik	I still enjoyed it tho
2016-01-28 18:57:09	RyanSmallwood	Rebecca has a bit of a mixed reputation because   David O. Selznick had such a heavy hand in it and it was Hitchcock's first American film
2016-01-28 18:57:29	RyanSmallwood	I really like it because its very atypical for a hitchcock film, but also a film no one but hitchcock could've made
2016-01-28 18:58:04	RyanSmallwood	there's definitely Rebecca fans out and about though, but its not universally well regarded
2016-01-28 18:58:22	Porkepik	I loved the characters more than anything in this one
2016-01-28 18:58:50	Porkepik	And the castle in itself is great, so huge and empty, kinda "sinister"
2016-01-28 18:58:56	Porkepik	I got why she was so uneasy
2016-01-28 18:59:07	RyanSmallwood	yeah
2016-01-28 18:59:35	RyanSmallwood	Notorious is pretty special too
2016-01-28 18:59:54	RyanSmallwood	I think Hitchcock has said he preferred working with good actors because he didn't have to direct them much
2016-01-28 19:00:01	Porkepik	Also, as someone who likes to be alone, I like having a couple respecting each others privacy
2016-01-28 19:00:40	RyanSmallwood	Cary Grant,
2016-01-28 19:00:40	RyanSmallwood	Ingrid Bergman, and Claude Rains   is probably the best cast he every got for a film
2016-01-28 19:00:55	Porkepik	And in the end, she understands it, and they're ok with it, I felt related to it and liked seeing such man not being represented as a "weird" "loner" guy
2016-01-28 19:01:15	RyanSmallwood	:)
2016-01-28 19:06:08	RyanSmallwood	so are you watching Rope after Notorious then?
2016-01-28 19:06:35	Porkepik	Yeah
2016-01-28 19:06:52	RyanSmallwood	cool cool
2016-01-28 19:15:03	Porkepik	Cary Grant was british :O (you can see my shitty knowledge in cinema)
2016-01-28 19:15:15	Porkepik	How good of a James Bond would he have been ?
2016-01-28 19:15:22	Porkepik	That's gonna be my first movie with him
2016-01-28 19:17:04	RyanSmallwood	North by Northwest basically is a James Bond movie with Carry Grant
2016-01-28 19:17:50	Porkepik	I love Hitchcock covers
2016-01-28 19:18:00	Porkepik	They're always so busy, I love the 40's cause of that

2016-01-28 20:09:02	scarlett	hey Porkepik and RyanSmallwood
2016-01-28 20:09:06	scarlett	:D
2016-01-28 20:09:25	RyanSmallwood	hello
2016-01-28 20:09:52	scarlett	so you guys heard of "birth of a nation"?
2016-01-28 20:10:03	scarlett	biggest sundance purchase in history
2016-01-28 20:10:47	RyanSmallwood	haven't but googling now
2016-01-28 20:10:55	scarlett	i'm dying to see it
2016-01-28 20:11:08	thewillmatic__	yeah that movie from the 20s?
2016-01-28 20:11:14	scarlett	same name
2016-01-28 20:11:19	scarlett	but new movie
2016-01-28 20:11:25	thewillmatic__	oh ok
2016-01-28 20:11:27	@indeedwatson	that is the weirdest movie to get a remake
2016-01-28 20:11:28	scarlett	the title is significant though
2016-01-28 20:11:34	scarlett	it's not a remake at all haha
2016-01-28 20:11:38	@indeedwatson	oh ok
2016-01-28 20:11:43	RyanSmallwood	the original birth of a nation was 1915 not the 20s thewillmatic__
2016-01-28 20:11:44	scarlett	although the original is pretty important in terms of film as a whole
2016-01-28 20:11:56	scarlett	especially in terms of cinematography and thigns
2016-01-28 20:12:00	thewillmatic__	my bad bro. thanks for the correction.
2016-01-28 20:12:05	scarlett	it was technically pretty amazing apparently
2016-01-28 20:12:12	scarlett	for the time of course
2016-01-28 20:12:23	scarlett	speaking of cinematograhpy i've noticed that the guy who did revenant
2016-01-28 20:12:28	scarlett	and knight of cups
2016-01-28 20:12:30	scarlett	and birdman
2016-01-28 20:12:32	scarlett	and gravity
2016-01-28 20:12:35	scarlett	i should just remmber his name lol
2016-01-28 20:12:39	uguuuu	lubezki!
2016-01-28 20:12:43	scarlett	ya :D
2016-01-28 20:12:59	scarlett	but in revenant and knight of cups he used a lot of orson welles-esque low angle shots
2016-01-28 20:13:03	scarlett	visible ceiling shots
2016-01-28 20:13:09	scarlett	that was really cool to see
2016-01-28 20:13:57	scarlett	i'm loving people eschewing special effects for like cool cinematography etc
2016-01-28 20:14:19	scarlett	like great angles, unorthodoxed ways of filming (using smart phones even)
2016-01-28 20:14:31	scarlett	anyone seen tangerine (2014)?
2016-01-28 20:14:48	@indeedwatson	yeah
2016-01-28 20:14:53	@indeedwatson	it was fun
2016-01-28 20:15:27	scarlett	ya i liked it and didnt know it was shot on an iphone 5s till afterwards
2016-01-28 20:15:43	scarlett	also reading about it, i learned that they usually say that people will forgive a bad picture but not bad sound
2016-01-28 20:15:48	RyanSmallwood	the technical innovations of Birth of a Nation are overstated more in depth looks at early film history has shown a lot of other innovations being made around the same time
2016-01-28 20:15:53	RyanSmallwood	the original one
2016-01-28 20:16:03	scarlett	RyanSmallwood: interesting
2016-01-28 20:16:10	scarlett	i wouldn't put it past people with an agenda
2016-01-28 20:16:20	scarlett	i mean the film is just straight up propaganda
2016-01-28 20:16:48	scarlett	but yeah these days i pay a lot more attention to sound - and that's not good if you are watching older movies
2016-01-28 20:16:50	scarlett	pre sync sound
2016-01-28 20:16:57	RyanSmallwood	its still a landmark in terms of making feature films in the US profitable, and it is a good showcase for lots of different technical innovations, but they weren't new
2016-01-28 20:17:03	scarlett	i actually really appreciate some older films with amazing vocal sync and stuff
2016-01-28 20:17:29	scarlett	oh yea i get what you mean
2016-01-28 20:17:56	scarlett	it's very rarely if ever that like some new innovations are used =for the first time it gets big - in like anything almost
2016-01-28 20:18:18	scarlett	like in music it happens a bunch, some artist uses a new technique and gets popular and sort of credited with "making it popular"
2016-01-28 20:18:38	scarlett	 as usually the person to really make it popular didn't invent it
2016-01-28 20:18:59	scarlett	i think i saw another movie
2016-01-28 20:19:01	scarlett	recently but i forgot!
2016-01-28 20:19:36	scarlett	i'm thinking of trying to "read" infinte jest via audiobook :o
2016-01-28 20:19:41	scarlett	anyone have thoughts on this
2016-01-28 20:19:50	scarlett	😅
2016-01-28 20:19:56	RyanSmallwood	does it have the footnotes?
2016-01-28 20:27:03	scarlett	ya but they aren't included
2016-01-28 20:27:10	scarlett	in the reading itself
2016-01-28 20:27:15	scarlett	i can either get a numbered PDF
2016-01-28 20:27:19	scarlett	and they read out the footnote number
2016-01-28 20:27:28	scarlett	or there is a separate footnote audiofile
2016-01-28 20:27:34	scarlett	have you read it RyanSmallwood?
2016-01-28 20:27:43	thewillmatic__	do you read along with text or just listen to the audio alone?
2016-01-28 20:27:49	RyanSmallwood	no, but I read an article about reading it
2016-01-28 20:27:59	RyanSmallwood	I would probably read In Search of Lost Time first if I was going to read a long book
2016-01-28 20:27:59	scarlett	ah cool
2016-01-28 20:28:19	scarlett	thewillmatic__: i'm new to audiobooks but so far i have just used the audio alone
2016-01-28 20:28:52	scarlett	it's really fun actually though! i started using them to help me fall asleep
2016-01-28 20:29:03	scarlett	i started with documentaries but i found documentaries to be horrible on average lol
2016-01-28 20:29:15	thewillmatic__	yeah same. tomflnt hooked me up with an audiobook on this book im starting
2016-01-28 20:29:26	scarlett	oh nice
2016-01-28 20:29:41	scarlett	holy crap RyanSmallwood!
2016-01-28 20:29:46	scarlett	checked out that book :O
2016-01-28 20:29:51	scarlett	it's in french toooo :/
2016-01-28 20:29:57	scarlett	infinite jest is not nearly as daunting

2016-01-28 20:39:10	RyanSmallwood	I have another account open in hex chat, because it saves the chat log incase I accidentally close the window

2016-01-28 20:43:18	scarlett	ah
2016-01-28 20:43:32	scarlett	you know what i started doing, getting high then going to the gym

2016-01-28 20:44:38	scarlett	like if i do squats stoned
2016-01-28 20:44:53	scarlett	i feel the muscles my legs or butt or back contract and it's like
2016-01-28 20:44:57	scarlett	more obvious in my head
2016-01-28 20:45:02	RyanSmallwood	for some reason whenever I smoke it feels like my short term memories can move to medium term memories or whatever and so every 10 seconds it feels like I just walked into the room, and basically I can't enjoy anything or understand what's going on until it wears off, not sure if there's a name for that

2016-01-28 21:08:41	scarlett	i guess it's sort of like a 'donation' in their eyes
2016-01-28 21:09:04	scarlett	so i recently got a new monitor
2016-01-28 21:09:19	@Carson	hey

2016-01-28 21:09:22	scarlett	and im not sure why but i find movies look better on this
2016-01-28 21:09:23	@Carson	wish there was more variety in the UI design
2016-01-28 21:09:34	scarlett	than on my TV, but my TV is like 42 inches
2016-01-28 21:09:41	scarlett	40 inches and samsung

2016-01-28 21:25:13	@indeedwatson	but maybe your tv is 720p
2016-01-28 21:26:13	Porkepik	Ryan smokes weed ?

2016-01-28 21:27:22	@indeedwatson	then it's obvious why it looks better lol

2016-01-28 21:31:26	@indeedwatson	agreed uguuuu, i used to have a secondary 15'' screen and i still miss it
2016-01-28 21:31:26	f91w	but yeah, I can see the use
2016-01-28 21:31:55	scarlett	okie i gotta make a smoothie
2016-01-28 21:31:57	@indeedwatson	but specifically for scarlett's needs, I think 2 1080p monitors would work much better than 1 1440
2016-01-28 21:32:08	Porkepik	Gonna add it to my watchlist
2016-01-28 21:32:09	scarlett	well

2016-01-28 21:32:26	uguuuu	i think the 1440p could be useful!

2016-01-28 21:52:06	Porkepik	Well, for what I've learn, the guy takes his movie seriously

2016-01-28 21:52:45	@indeedwatson	now that i think about it, there's some parallels with Samurai Cop, foreign director convinced he's doing a great movie
2016-01-28 21:52:48	Porkepik	So they do, but not in the way he expected it, that must indeed make him a bit sad
2016-01-28 21:53:03	@indeedwatson	Porkepik: no, he gets angry when people laugh at the movie iirc

2016-01-28 21:55:26	Porkepik	I wasn't talking about "crazy" but "delusional"
2016-01-28 21:55:38	Porkepik	I thought we changed the adjective :|
2016-01-28 21:55:58	@indeedwatson	"adjective 1. having false or unrealistic beliefs or opinions"

2016-01-28 22:00:59	@indeedwatson	it's difficult to compare that kind of movie because a lot of the charm is so particular to it and the odd choices they make
2016-01-28 22:01:27	RyanSmallwood	seriously though, godfrey ho movies are where its at for bad films
2016-01-28 22:01:35	@Carson	it is it's own thing but as far as good bad movies go

2016-01-28 22:03:45	RyanSmallwood	indeedwatson: let me know if you want godfrey ho recommendations, cobra against ninja has a great opening, but that one is kind of boring
2016-01-28 22:03:48	@indeedwatson	RyanSmallwood: they watched and "reviewed" that one in Best of the Worst, the RLM segment where they watch random B movies
2016-01-28 22:03:56	@indeedwatson	Carson: Mothravka's?
2016-01-28 22:04:11	@Carson	probably or Porke
2016-01-28 22:04:19	Mothravka	Can't be my list, it isn't crazy!
2016-01-28 22:04:34	Mothravka	Heh.
2016-01-28 22:04:48	RyanSmallwood	I can make a crazy list of 250 films...
2016-01-28 22:04:56	uguuuu	i have seen 250 films
2016-01-28 22:05:01	Mothravka	Me too.
2016-01-28 22:05:03	@Carson	it was whoever I asked if it was their personal list or top in historical canon films
2016-01-28 22:05:14	uguuuu	i can make a list of... 250 random films that i've seen
2016-01-28 22:05:16	Mothravka	Oh, then it was my list.
2016-01-28 22:05:20	uguuuu	it might be as good as the imdb top 250!
2016-01-28 22:05:52	RyanSmallwood	I did my top 121 recently, but I want to triple it
2016-01-28 22:06:06	uguuuu	363, the magic number
2016-01-28 22:06:34	Mothravka	It's going to be interesting doing a new list in about 10 years.
2016-01-28 22:06:42	Mothravka	See how much has changed etc.
2016-01-28 22:07:02	RyanSmallwood	you've got to increase the number each year otherwise you end up removing good old movies just because new movies have been made

2016-01-29 01:06:44	f91w	I wish you could host a cytube that would stream from an mms: link or something generic so you're not restricted to youtube
2016-01-29 01:14:21	scarlett	whats cytube
2016-01-29 01:15:48	RyanSmallwood	its a movie streaming website where you can watch movies with people over the internet
2016-01-29 01:16:04	RyanSmallwood	the movie syncs for everyone on the page and there's a chat window next to it
2016-01-29 01:16:17	RyanSmallwood	Truefilm hosts some screenings there for their monthly themes and stuff
2016-01-29 01:16:35	scarlett	ohh ya

2016-01-29 01:17:25	scarlett	i'm kinda becoming a quality nut these days
2016-01-29 01:18:01	scarlett	but i find the old movies just aren't as clear as the new stuff
2016-01-29 01:18:13	scarlett	i guess camera technology - or maybe bad film transfers
2016-01-29 01:18:17	f91w	Stop watching the old movies then.
2016-01-29 01:18:35	RyanSmallwood	it depends which old movies
2016-01-29 01:18:47	RyanSmallwood	I dunno I think blu-rays of old movies look great
2016-01-29 01:18:54	RyanSmallwood	but there are differences in film stocks and lenses and stuff
2016-01-29 01:18:55	uguuuu	yea!
2016-01-29 01:19:20	RyanSmallwood	I was mostly old movies though, I'm bad at staying up to date with modern cinema
2016-01-29 01:19:28	uguuuu	usually if an old movie is soft on bluray it's because it wasn't scanned from the negative
2016-01-29 01:19:28	RyanSmallwood	*watch mostly
2016-01-29 01:19:33	f91w	What are the best drugs to take while watching films? Just the right amount of alcohol for a buzz, or something else?
2016-01-29 01:20:08	RyanSmallwood	best is watching a movie sober
2016-01-29 01:20:11	@indeedwatson	apparently Voices of Light was made for the shorter version of Joan of Arc
2016-01-29 01:20:23	RyanSmallwood	heh
2016-01-29 01:20:25	@indeedwatson	f91w: i've only watched movies on weed and i like it
2016-01-29 01:21:00	RyanSmallwood	indeedwatson: did you notice the time difference or did you watch the whole movie out of sync until the music suddenly stopped?
2016-01-29 01:21:45	@indeedwatson	i fumbled with the timing a few times throughout but eventually i found it seemed to sync and then it stopped
2016-01-29 01:22:19	f91w	I once watched this one film, I don't know which one, where the camera switched between two images as some ringing or sirens were blaring in the background. The back-and-forth felt like an infinite loop while high, and I nearly panicked.
2016-01-29 01:27:11	@indeedwatson	i dont think i ever panicked watching a movie

2016-01-29 16:09:46	thewillmatic__	yeah
2016-01-29 16:09:56	@indeedwatson	need to rewatch it
2016-01-29 16:11:18	thewillmatic__	soundtrack to that movie is good too. really offbeat/avant type stuff.
2016-01-29 16:11:52	@indeedwatson	yeah, this is my favorite track from it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Al5i_cwsk

2016-01-29 16:13:00	thewillmatic__	yeah i like that one too. there’s another one that didn’t make it to the official OST release by the same guy
2016-01-29 16:13:10	thewillmatic__	lemme see if i can find it
2016-01-29 16:13:15	*	thewillmatic__ scours YouTube.
2016-01-29 16:15:12	thewillmatic__	it was in a famous scene in the film. wont say which because it might spoil it.

2016-01-29 16:17:18	thewillmatic__	the actual one in the movie sounds a bit different. i’d pay good money to get my hands on that version.
2016-01-29 16:20:04	scarlett	ya i tried to watch it
2016-01-29 16:20:10	scarlett	seemed a bit slow
2016-01-29 16:20:18	scarlett	i saw no country for old men
2016-01-29 16:20:23	scarlett	and didnt think that it was that great
2016-01-29 16:20:34	scarlett	and in my mind i have no country for old men and there will be blood lumped together
2016-01-29 16:20:57	@indeedwatson	they came out in the same year and are regarded as some of the best movies of that decade
2016-01-29 16:21:01	@indeedwatson	and were shot nearby iirc
2016-01-29 16:21:01	thewillmatic__	fun fact - they were filmed in a part of west texas within a few miles of each other
2016-01-29 16:21:19	thewillmatic__	at the same time too. NCFOM crew saw smoke from a TWBB scene
2016-01-29 16:22:02	Mothravka	There will be no blood for old country men.

2016-01-29 16:25:04	Porkepik	scarlett => Do you have a imdb or letterboxd account where you have ratings or favorites ?
2016-01-29 16:25:21	Porkepik	Just to have an idea on your taste and all
2016-01-29 16:25:28	Mothravka	I just watched Memories of Matsuko (2006). My head. What an awful movie. It finally ended.

2016-01-29 17:06:02	Porkepik	I've heard of people who even prefered to watch it on VHS

2016-01-29 17:07:07	scarlett	nice
2016-01-29 17:07:19	Mothravka	Artificial Eye will be releasing some Tarkovsky films on Blu-ray soon this year: http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=15450

2016-01-29 17:08:17	Mothravka	I'm gonna get the box set, but that one will be released a bit later than the stand-alones, odd enough.
2016-01-29 17:08:32	Porkepik	CRITERION WERE YOU AT
2016-01-29 17:08:34	Porkepik	We need you !
2016-01-29 17:08:50	Porkepik	They only have his first 3 movies :(
2016-01-29 17:09:00	Porkepik	tho, are criterion release of Tarkovsky good ?
2016-01-29 17:09:29	Mothravka	From a DVD aspect, yeah.
2016-01-29 17:09:29	scarlett	i think solaris is legit
2016-01-29 17:09:44	Porkepik	Oh, only DVD, didn't know
2016-01-29 17:09:48	scarlett	ya
2016-01-29 17:09:50	scarlett	no no
2016-01-29 17:09:50	Mothravka	But the Solaris (1972) Blu-ray looks great.
2016-01-29 17:09:52	scarlett	ya
2016-01-29 17:09:59	scarlett	solaris criterion blu ray is legit
2016-01-29 17:10:02	scarlett	good transfer
2016-01-29 17:10:12	Mothravka	Yeah, I rewatched it a while ago.
2016-01-29 17:10:24	scarlett	lol The only English dub recorded for Solaris was of an edited version of the film, so every now and again, the dialogue will switch back to Russian when there is no corresponding recorded English dub. This is a known issue with the current Dual Audio rips
2016-01-29 17:10:48	Mothravka	Why would one want to watch an English dub?!
2016-01-29 17:11:26	Mothravka	Blasphemy!
2016-01-29 17:12:03	Porkepik	Whatching movie with dubbing ? :O
2016-01-29 17:12:07	Card	because 'muricans can't read
2016-01-29 17:12:23	@indeedwatson	there is one instance where i've considered an english dub, Tatami Galaxy, because it's so fast and busy visually that you just can't read and appreciate the animation at the same time
2016-01-29 17:12:35	Porkepik	Watch it twice
2016-01-29 17:12:55	@indeedwatson	yeah that's what i'll probably do
2016-01-29 17:13:06	Mothravka	Who cares about Americans? Heh!
2016-01-29 17:13:55	Porkepik	It's cause of us, we did the mistake of helping them being independant ! Now they're taking over the world !
2016-01-29 17:17:36	scarlett	well to be fair
2016-01-29 17:17:49	scarlett	miyazaki has said he recommends his viewers to watch dubs of his films
2016-01-29 17:17:57	scarlett	but also to be fair i don't prefer the dubs of his films
2016-01-29 17:18:22	@indeedwatson	the choice of voice for Wind Rises was so odd
2016-01-29 17:18:23	@indeedwatson	but it worked
2016-01-29 17:18:26	scarlett	but it is actually cool to switch to the dubs
2016-01-29 17:18:30	scarlett	to take in the visuals
2016-01-29 17:18:31	Porkepik	It's a recommendation cause he tends to think the visual of his movies are more important than the dialogues
2016-01-29 17:18:33	scarlett	which was his point
2016-01-29 17:18:35	scarlett	yeah

2016-01-29 17:19:34	Porkepik	Tho, I think having a "non complete" first experience of a movie can be something interesting, so it gives you a good reason to rewatch it to focus completly on something else

2016-01-29 17:19:53	Porkepik	Rope was quite overwhelming

2016-01-29 17:23:14	RyanSmallwood	Hitch is pretty stellar
2016-01-29 17:23:28	Porkepik	I know I'm only watching his most famous and apprecieted work tho, but if I can say at the end I all liked them, I can definilty understand the praise he got
2016-01-29 17:24:02	RyanSmallwood	his work is pretty consistent overall, even his worst films are usually worth watching
2016-01-29 17:24:22	RyanSmallwood	although he does repeat himself a bit, so you kind of get used to his tricks when you go deep into his filmography
2016-01-29 17:24:23	scarlett	friends is still aired in north america Porkepik
2016-01-29 17:24:29	scarlett	it's pretty popular and earns a bunch of money
2016-01-29 17:24:32	scarlett	sienfeld too
2016-01-29 17:24:44	scarlett	seinfeld is consistently one of hte top earners i believe lol
2016-01-29 17:24:51	Porkepik	Yeah, but for example Seinfeld is almost unknown in France
2016-01-29 17:24:56	Porkepik	While people still watch Friends
2016-01-29 17:25:04	scarlett	yea friends has way more global appeal i think
2016-01-29 17:25:07	Porkepik	Not all american shows get attention

2016-01-29 17:25:29	scarlett	it's not huge in china in general
2016-01-29 17:25:38	scarlett	but it's quite well known amongst chinese youth
2016-01-29 17:25:47	scarlett	especially as something to help them improve their english
2016-01-29 17:26:13	scarlett	seinfelds humor has a lot to do with american cultural norms
2016-01-29 17:26:14	RyanSmallwood	I think when you get to Hitchcock's later films, you'll appreciate how versatile he can be though, he stayed on the cutting edge for a long time considering how early he started
2016-01-29 17:26:25	scarlett	and trying to point out the silliness or arbitrariness of social customs
2016-01-29 17:26:30	scarlett	and how people commit faux pas etc
2016-01-29 17:26:44	scarlett	so that humor is probably harder to get if you aren't familiar with the culture
2016-01-29 17:26:52	Porkepik	So today, we start 50's Hitchcock !
2016-01-29 17:26:56	scarlett	friends is more about relationships and stuff
2016-01-29 17:27:00	RyanSmallwood	I think its when he saw Blowup he realized that the younger generation had moved past him
2016-01-29 17:27:14	Porkepik	Blowup 1966 ?
2016-01-29 17:27:17	Porkepik	Antonioni ?
2016-01-29 17:27:20	RyanSmallwood	yup
2016-01-29 17:28:19	RyanSmallwood	Strangers on a Train is awesome because its one of the few roles his daughter did, Patricia Hitchcock
2016-01-29 17:28:31	RyanSmallwood	she's really great, but she quit because everyone was saying she was just an actress because of her pather
2016-01-29 17:28:32	RyanSmallwood	*father
2016-01-29 17:30:01	Porkepik	:(
2016-01-29 17:30:08	Porkepik	#HitchockLivesMatter
2016-01-29 17:30:16	Porkepik	Stop bullying !
2016-01-29 17:31:58	RyanSmallwood	well its just a shame cause I feel like she had her dad's sense of humor and her performance is really unique (if I remember properly, my memory of movies is shit), shame not to have more movies with her
2016-01-29 17:33:10	RyanSmallwood	anyways you'll find out soon
2016-01-29 17:33:18	Porkepik	It's annoying cause I have the french dvds (from my grandfather) and the title translations of Hitchcock are completly different
2016-01-29 17:33:30	RyanSmallwood	ahhh
2016-01-29 17:33:34	Porkepik	I will try to get bluray rips for his later work tho (Vertigo+)
2016-01-29 17:33:45	Porkepik	So "Strangers of a train" becomes "L'inconnu du nord express"
2016-01-29 17:33:51	RyanSmallwood	hah
2016-01-29 17:34:00	Porkepik	And "Dial M for murder" becomes "Le crime était presque parfait"
2016-01-29 17:34:42	RyanSmallwood	I was thinking of making a list for classic American cinema, but I don't know if it will be motivating to complete, because I don't think I can keep it short
2016-01-29 17:37:36	Porkepik	Well, american cinema ain't the shortest, so quite logical :/
2016-01-29 17:38:15	RyanSmallwood	yeah it took me a long time to dive into American cinema, cause it was overwhelming how much there was to watch
2016-01-29 17:39:15	thewillmatic__	even if you make a list and leave some stuff off, it would still expose people to new films they hadn’t heard of. assuming you post the list on reddit or letterboxd or something
2016-01-29 17:40:05	RyanSmallwood	Heh I'll probably make it, trouble is I like to include forgotten masterpieces, but I don't want to sacrifice the well known masterpieces either, so its tricky to find the right balance
2016-01-29 17:40:26	RyanSmallwood	I'll keep it as short as possible, but it still might end up ballooning out a lot
2016-01-29 17:41:16	RyanSmallwood	there's a few great hollywood films I haven't seen yet, so I'm actually going to make it a mini project of mine to watch a handful of essential films I'm missing before I make the list

2016-01-29 17:50:07	Card	Christopher Lopez: can't wait to male gaze them
2016-01-29 17:52:28	RyanSmallwood	she should've trolled everyone and just listed Peeping Tom 10 times
2016-01-29 17:53:41	RyanSmallwood	you write one essay and it follows you around for the rest of your life

2016-01-30 13:45:58	Porkepik	So wait
2016-01-30 13:46:21	RyanSmallwood	???
2016-01-30 13:47:21	Porkepik	One day you talked (I guess it was more of a joke) about "ugly criterion poster" or something like that. And I noticed (like a few weeks ago) that the 400 blows letterboxd page changed poster : http://letterboxd.com/film/the-400-blows/ they put the the criterion poster instead of the french release poster : http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNTMzOTA2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQ2OTI3MjE@.

2016-01-30 13:47:46	Porkepik	I did some research and actually, on TMDB, release poster can only be posted for "specific languages" so in a way, the guy who made the change was allow to do so
2016-01-30 13:48:17	Porkepik	Or then you would have to put the english poster release : http://s3.amazonaws.com/auteurs_production/post_images/9784/400Blows_USA_2.jpg?1328888438 (I think this is this one)

2016-01-30 13:48:56	Porkepik	But anyway, my idea was to ask what people think of criterion cover, they tend to be very black and white (see antonioni cover)
2016-01-30 13:49:04	junglizer	o/
2016-01-30 13:49:29	Porkepik	And personally, I would prefer TMDB to put the release poster in the original language, instead of allowing a poster made like 20 years after the filmmaker death
2016-01-30 13:49:52	@indeedwatson	hi junglizer 
2016-01-30 13:49:56	Porkepik	I just put "Ryan poster" to remind myself to ask you, cause I often forget
2016-01-30 13:50:35	Porkepik	Also, hello
2016-01-30 13:50:40	RyanSmallwood	Criterion generally has very good covers (recently their track record is not as great), but they also have their own style that kind of markets the films  in a certain kind of way like this is an upscale DVD label bringing you the best of world cinema kind of a thing
2016-01-30 13:51:02	RyanSmallwood	I like lots of criterion artwork together as its own thing, I think it always clashes with the original poster art on letterboxd
2016-01-30 13:51:08	Porkepik	There is one I really don't like : https://www.criterion.com/films/217-hiroshima-mon-amour
2016-01-30 13:51:08		[ http://is.gd/GNxpyV ]
2016-01-30 13:52:15	Porkepik	I think it's too much, I mean, it's a cover and it doesn't matter but I really don't get what they need to make it so dark at times, same thing with the 400 blows, it's depressing as fuck ... And I don't think the movie is, or then it's obviously biased, but anyway it doesn't matter a lot and it's normal they can't always have perfect success and satisfy everyone
2016-01-30 13:52:45	RyanSmallwood	yeah its tricky to capture the mood of the film
2016-01-30 13:53:36	RyanSmallwood	what did you think of the last 2 hitchcocks?
2016-01-30 13:55:01	Porkepik	Oh yeah that, sorry
2016-01-30 13:55:16	Porkepik	I like Strangers on a train, not as much as some others but it was good
2016-01-30 13:55:37	Porkepik	Tho the end with the manege ... That was the fuckiest fucked up thing I saw on a Hitchock so far
2016-01-30 13:56:00	Porkepik	I was IRL :O for at least a minute straight
2016-01-30 13:56:35	Porkepik	Then, I really liked Dial M for Murder, made me think of Rope
2016-01-30 13:57:03	RyanSmallwood	I still haven't seen Dial M :O :O :O
2016-01-30 13:57:12	Porkepik	:O
2016-01-30 13:57:46	Porkepik	That's even more surprising than the end of Strangers on a train ! I'm shocked !
2016-01-30 13:57:48	Porkepik	Blasphemy !
2016-01-30 13:58:04	zxc	much blasphemy
2016-01-30 13:58:13	zxc	but I like rope more than both of those
2016-01-30 13:58:49	Porkepik	Anyway, today "James Stewart creeps his neighbours"
2016-01-30 13:58:58	RyanSmallwood	you're going to watch The Trouble with Harry and be like "what the hell is Ryan doing? Why was this on the list over Rope?"
2016-01-30 14:00:42	Porkepik	haha, I hope so, gonna change from the usual "I LIKED IT ! VERY CINEMA ! MUCH MASTERPIECE !" maybe :D
2016-01-30 14:03:15	Porkepik	So technically ... I already saw Rear Window a long time ago but only a part of it
2016-01-30 14:03:24	Porkepik	I can remember like a few minutes of it, at most tho
2016-01-30 14:04:15	RyanSmallwood	now you can appreciate it in context though
2016-01-30 14:04:36	Porkepik	I love James Stewart, I'm so excited about it
2016-01-30 14:04:39	Porkepik	His accent is funny
2016-01-30 14:04:42	Porkepik	(or voice)
2016-01-30 14:04:53	zxc	I like listening to james stewart too
2016-01-30 14:04:54	RyanSmallwood	and you can stand back and be like ah yes its a metaphor for cinema james sterwart is me the audience
2016-01-30 14:05:33	Porkepik	I guess I'm gonna have to read Hitchcock/Truffaut after
2016-01-30 14:05:47	RyanSmallwood	definitely its great
2016-01-30 14:06:05	RyanSmallwood	really the best book about film ever written
2016-01-30 14:06:24	Porkepik	Do I have to watch more Truffaut before ?
2016-01-30 14:06:39	RyanSmallwood	no no, they're just discussing Hitchcock's filmography
2016-01-30 14:06:42	Porkepik	Ok
2016-01-30 14:07:02	RyanSmallwood	Truffaut is just there to tell Hitchcock why all his shitty films are secretly his best films
2016-01-30 14:07:08	Porkepik	Haha
2016-01-30 14:07:29	RyanSmallwood	Hitchcock: It was a complete failure, I should've never done it
2016-01-30 14:07:38	RyanSmallwood	Truffaut: In France we liked it more than your other filsm
2016-01-30 14:07:43	RyanSmallwood	*films
2016-01-30 14:07:55	RyanSmallwood	might want to look into the original audio recordings
2016-01-30 14:07:58	Porkepik	Yeah, for example in France, I always hear people speaking a lot about Birds and dial m for muder
2016-01-30 14:08:09	RyanSmallwood	cause the book is just an edited version of their discussion recordings
2016-01-30 14:08:16	Porkepik	But until I got on letterboxd and here, never heard of vertigo and north by northwest
2016-01-30 14:08:17	RyanSmallwood	with all the dirt jokes cut out
2016-01-30 14:08:20	RyanSmallwood	*dirty
2016-01-30 14:08:28	Porkepik	Oh ok
2016-01-30 14:09:05	RyanSmallwood	do you know Vertigo just placed number 1 on Sight and Sound's critics poll after several decades of Citizen Kane being #1?
2016-01-30 14:10:38	Porkepik	I still haven't watch Citizen Kane :|
2016-01-30 14:10:56	Porkepik	But at least ! I will have watch The trouble with harry !
2016-01-30 14:11:02	RyanSmallwood	:D :D :D
2016-01-30 14:11:16	RyanSmallwood	Citizen Kane's reputation is bit overstated
2016-01-30 14:11:47	RyanSmallwood	it comes from an old story about how film aesthetics developed by looking at unique films in film history instead of looking at standard films
2016-01-30 14:12:57	RyanSmallwood	you say, "First film was theatrical, then Griffith and Eiseinstein discovered editing and began using the power of cinema, then Citizen Kane went back to the theatrical style but after knowing what editing is  guiding the viewer's eye through the frame instead of cutting"
2016-01-30 14:13:39	RyanSmallwood	basically it uses extreme depth photography to create multiple areas of interest within single long takes
2016-01-30 14:13:41	@indeedwatson	heh, i just finished the Citizen Kane bit of Film Art
2016-01-30 14:14:19	RyanSmallwood	Bordwell calls it more an example of extreme style rather than some pioneering landmark because its influence wasn't all that wide
2016-01-30 14:15:12	Porkepik	I'm gonna listen to Sartre : "Citizen Kane sucks ! Not relevant for le french man !" :D
2016-01-30 14:16:58	RyanSmallwood	http://www.hd-compare.de/citizen_kane/citizen_kane_11_dvd.png
2016-01-30 14:17:00		[ http://is.gd/qHutn6 ]
2016-01-30 14:17:16	RyanSmallwood	So Depth! So Montage! Two Shots, One Frame!
2016-01-30 14:17:44	@indeedwatson	what's wrong with that?
2016-01-30 14:18:05	RyanSmallwood	nothing at all :D I'm just joking about the importance of it
2016-01-30 14:18:12	RyanSmallwood	its very cool, but it doesn't change the way we watch movies
2016-01-30 14:18:27	@indeedwatson	that's up to individuals isn't it?
2016-01-30 14:18:31	Porkepik	We all agree anyway the greatest masterpiece is Shawshank Redemption and The Dark Knight
2016-01-30 14:18:46	RyanSmallwood	:P
2016-01-30 14:18:58	@indeedwatson	Breathless didn't change how i watch movies but it's still very highly regarded
2016-01-30 14:19:19	RyanSmallwood	Bordwell just points out that its been going on since Feuillade, Kane just uses special effects to make it very exagerated
2016-01-30 14:20:19	Porkepik	How important was Hitchock in editing ?
2016-01-30 14:20:23	@indeedwatson	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2016-01-30 14:20:54	RyanSmallwood	Hitchcock learned everything he knew working in German silent films
2016-01-30 14:21:10	RyanSmallwood	Hitchcock to me is the guy who can synthesize all the techniques together
2016-01-30 14:21:29	RyanSmallwood	when you read the truffaut interviews, you'll get an idea how brilliant he is
2016-01-30 14:21:45	RyanSmallwood	its not so much any single technique he does, just his overall approach to cinema and how he uses all its elements together
2016-01-30 14:22:16	RyanSmallwood	He mastered it right from the beginning and stayed relevant for 4 decades
2016-01-30 14:22:31	Porkepik	Apparently Dial M for Murder was shot in 3D, what does that mean ? 3D with the blue red glasses ?
2016-01-30 14:22:40	RyanSmallwood	yup
2016-01-30 14:22:55	Porkepik	Yeah, that was is surprising me the most, at the beginning I thought I would only really enjoyed his movies from the late 50's
2016-01-30 14:23:16	Porkepik	But I wasn't disappointed and I loved his earlier work
2016-01-30 14:23:27	RyanSmallwood	yeah he was great right from the start
2016-01-30 14:23:52	RyanSmallwood	I think in some interview someone asked him which of the great silent directors influenced him
2016-01-30 14:23:52	Porkepik	I feel the same with Kurosawa but only watched his first movie, I really liked it and felt as he was already "made" and professional
2016-01-30 14:24:02	RyanSmallwood	and he was like, I was one of the great silent directors
2016-01-30 14:24:07	Porkepik	Haha
2016-01-30 14:25:50	RyanSmallwood	Fritz Lang was bitter because he also started in silent film, but was never nearly as popular as HItchcock in hollywood
2016-01-30 14:26:15	Porkepik	I'm noticing a lot of silent directors like that :/
2016-01-30 14:26:29	RyanSmallwood	Yeah most directors have one golden age and then they fizzle
2016-01-30 14:26:40	RyanSmallwood	only a handful of directors have relevant work over several decades
2016-01-30 14:26:44	RyanSmallwood	like Bunuel
2016-01-30 14:27:06	Mothravka	And Godard!
2016-01-30 14:27:18	Porkepik	Honestly, I really love "old" american cinema, I really want to watch more of it, but I never liked the more recent one ... (70's+)
2016-01-30 14:28:02	Porkepik	Tho the 80's were pretty good I must admit
2016-01-30 14:28:04	RyanSmallwood	yeah old American cinema was so hugely influential on the French New Wave and New German Cinema for a  reason
2016-01-30 14:28:33	RyanSmallwood	I'm building my list, its getting very long, but necessarily so I think
2016-01-30 14:28:53	Mothravka	And Germans were influental in old Hollywood, heh.
2016-01-30 14:29:09	RyanSmallwood	also in the 1940s
2016-01-30 14:29:19	RyanSmallwood	during WWII a lot of emigres became prominent directors in the US
2016-01-30 14:29:25	Mothravka	Exactly!
2016-01-30 14:30:06	RyanSmallwood	I think some interviewer asked Fassbinder why he was influenced by American directors instead of German directors, and his response was I am influenced by German directors, like Douglas Sirk!
2016-01-30 14:30:32	Mothravka	Hah1
2016-01-30 14:30:42	Mothravka	Good old Rainer.
2016-01-30 14:31:00	Mothravka	Total Sirk worship.
2016-01-30 14:33:31	Card	hmm, what should I watch tonight
2016-01-30 14:34:11	Porkepik	I won't ask myself this question for a loooong time
2016-01-30 14:34:12	Card	Killing of a Chinese Bookie, perhaps?
2016-01-30 14:34:22	RyanSmallwood	ahahahahha
2016-01-30 14:34:26	@indeedwatson	Furious 7
2016-01-30 14:34:42	RyanSmallwood	Phantom of the Paradise!
2016-01-30 14:34:52	Porkepik	I remember it being one of your favorite
2016-01-30 14:35:00	Porkepik	I still haven't watch any Brian de palma
2016-01-30 14:35:12	RyanSmallwood	oh I love Phantom of the Paradise so much
2016-01-30 14:35:48	Mothravka	You sure do. You sure do!
2016-01-30 14:36:52	RyanSmallwood	Porkepik: good thing too, it would be blasphemy to watch de palma before hitchcock
2016-01-30 14:36:54	@indeedwatson	tomflint: i posted a question in r/pizza and the only response was "no"
2016-01-30 14:37:33	Porkepik	I will definilty feel better after watching The trouble with Harry, that was bothering me for a while
2016-01-30 14:37:38	Porkepik	Kappa

2016-01-30 17:48:31	Card	but quite entertaining if you watch one every now and then
2016-01-30 17:48:36	RyanSmallwood	yeah I think some are considered better than others
2016-01-30 17:48:50	RyanSmallwood	I've only seen Zatoichi vs The One-Armed Swordsman because its a HK co-production
2016-01-30 17:50:40	Card	I liked the first three quite a bit

2016-01-30 20:11:40	@indeedwatson	hello scarlett sup
2016-01-30 20:11:52	scarlett	i didn't watch anything yesterday
2016-01-30 20:11:53	scarlett	:(:
2016-01-30 20:12:26	scarlett	so i have this idea
2016-01-30 20:12:43	scarlett	reddit but it's invite only, public to everyone to view, invite only to hvae an account
2016-01-30 20:12:50	scarlett	it's not invite rather, you have to apply
2016-01-30 20:13:14	@indeedwatson	that sounds like what voat was last year
2016-01-30 20:13:22	scarlett	no
2016-01-30 20:13:32	scarlett	like you have to apply
2016-01-30 20:13:36	scarlett	it's not for regular people
2016-01-30 20:13:54	scarlett	the criteria will be like you have to prove you are a professional in a field
2016-01-30 20:13:56	scarlett	or something like that
2016-01-30 20:14:00	@indeedwatson	scarlett: but then you run into the problem that there's probably gonna be no one there :p
2016-01-30 20:14:00	scarlett	baiscally you want to screen for high quality people
2016-01-30 20:14:09	scarlett	you only need very few people
2016-01-30 20:14:12	scarlett	to create
2016-01-30 20:14:36	scarlett	like i think it's around 1000 users who create the vast majority of OC on reddit

2016-01-30 20:22:04	RyanSmallwood	I guess it depends on how active the moderators are
2016-01-30 20:22:07	scarlett	the thing is these things are upvoted because people want these things
2016-01-30 20:22:13	scarlett	it's not about activity
2016-01-30 20:22:23	scarlett	many of this content is like allowed in certain subreddits rules
2016-01-30 20:22:23	RyanSmallwood	askfeminists would probably get tons of attacks, but their place seems pretty clean

2016-01-30 20:22:40	RyanSmallwood	like you do get dumb questions but thats partially the point
2016-01-30 20:22:54	scarlett	i dont think you guys are on the same page as me at all
2016-01-30 20:22:59	scarlett	so i guess we can talk about something else
2016-01-30 20:23:23	RyanSmallwood	any examples?
2016-01-30 20:24:14	tomflint	have you guys ever played Mafia?
2016-01-30 20:25:46	@indeedwatson	no but i played settlers of catan for the first time recently
2016-01-30 20:27:30	tomflint	a bunch of us have been playing a game like Mafia in ##werewolf --- http://werewolf.chat has all of the rules. If you want to play, join the channel and watch a game or two.
2016-01-30 20:27:38	tomflint	its fun
2016-01-30 20:27:51	Mothravka	Mafia is one of the best games ever.
2016-01-30 20:28:21	Mothravka	I remembered that I waited and looked forward to it for years before it was to be released. Sweet years.
2016-01-30 20:28:38	tomflint	Mothravka: come play!
2016-01-30 20:28:52	tomflint	we've got 8 people playing now -- make sure you're using a proper chat client
2016-01-30 20:28:53	tomflint	its fun
2016-01-30 20:29:03	Mothravka	Sorry, I don't have the time for that, heh.
2016-01-30 20:29:16	tomflint	haha. the games are only about 5 minutes each

2016-01-30 20:51:16	RyanSmallwood	weird having a more modern sound track over silent films sometimes
2016-01-30 20:51:28	@indeedwatson	RyanSmallwood: which one 
2016-01-30 20:51:39	RyanSmallwood	Regeneration by Raoul Walsh
2016-01-30 20:52:30	RyanSmallwood	my music vocabulary is shit at describing things
2016-01-30 20:52:37	RyanSmallwood	but its weird cause its like trying to sound old timey
2016-01-30 20:52:57	RyanSmallwood	but it feels like a electronically produced sound track and certain sections have these very heavy modern beats to them
2016-01-30 20:56:42	RyanSmallwood	here's an example at 9:42 if the link doesn't work https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eq02ndFO5gE&feature=youtu.be&t=9m42s

2016-01-31 15:47:46	Mothravka	What's that?
2016-01-31 15:48:01	@indeedwatson	RyanSmallwood: i see the reddit titles but did not click any
2016-01-31 15:49:03	RyanSmallwood	basically the finebros who do a video series of people reacting to youtube videos are trying to make some business move where other people pay them to use their video reacting format, and then youtube exploded
2016-01-31 15:49:31	@indeedwatson	aren't they trying to copyright it?
2016-01-31 15:49:53	@indeedwatson	like i think it was sony trying to trademark "let's play"
2016-01-31 15:49:53	RyanSmallwood	well there's two levels
2016-01-31 15:50:14	RyanSmallwood	part of the outrage is people misunderstanding thinking they want to copyright every react video, when its just their specific format of react videos
2016-01-31 15:50:26	RyanSmallwood	but the idea is still pretty dumb and they sound like assholes
2016-01-31 15:50:40	@indeedwatson	sounds like a standard popular yt channel

2016-01-31 15:54:45	RyanSmallwood	its just dramz
2016-01-31 16:16:50	Porkepik	"[19:50] <RyanSmallwood> part of the outrage is people misunderstanding thinking they want to copyright every react video, when its just their specific format of react videos" That doesn't matter much, they could very easily "abuse" it and shape many reaction videos to accomodate their format
2016-01-31 16:17:44	RyanSmallwood	well yeah, the whole thing is very shady, and I actually haven't seen any of their videos so I don't know how unique their format is
2016-01-31 16:18:00	Porkepik	Also, their "format" is quite simple and the idea isn't that original, it's not like they invented it, to me at least
2016-01-31 16:19:49	Porkepik	TV already did it, in a way, we could say
2016-01-31 16:20:28	Porkepik	After 9/11, TV filmed a lot of live reaction to, for example, tribes reacting to the attack they never heard about (because they're isolated to the rest of the world)
2016-01-31 16:20:35	Porkepik	The internet just made that easier and more accessible

2016-01-31 16:20:46	Porkepik	*
2016-01-31 16:21:04	RyanSmallwood	they also did an update recently where they seem really mad but are trying to act like they're nice and say really stupid shit like how sorry they are... that their last video confused everyone and no one understood how cool their idea was...
2016-01-31 16:21:25	Porkepik	Well, they're gonna have to drop it and hope it calmed down
2016-01-31 16:21:37	RyanSmallwood	that would be the smart thing to do
2016-01-31 16:22:04	Porkepik	They're gonna lose a little bit of their fanbase, but I'm sure they will do fine(bros ... HAHAHAHA) since people are gonna watch their next videos out of "curiosity"
2016-01-31 16:22:55	RyanSmallwood	they're losing thousands of subscribers, but its not a big amount compared to their total following
2016-01-31 16:23:06	Porkepik	In a way, that's still a publicity stunt, not really a good one, but you can guess many people are discovering who they are right now and clicking on those vids (people who often don't have adblocks and may not understand what the drama is really about)
2016-01-31 16:23:37	RyanSmallwood	I dunno, no doubt they're getting some publicity, but it seems they're losing more than they're gaining
2016-01-31 16:24:10	RyanSmallwood	they were already pretty big, so I don't see how being ridiculed on the internet will be a gain in the long run
2016-01-31 16:24:51	Porkepik	Well, happens to a lot of youtube "personnalities", they start gaining too much confidence and think they're actually doing something good, maybe
2016-01-31 16:25:05	Porkepik	Or they're just conmen and don't give a shit
2016-01-31 16:25:47	RyanSmallwood	I just think its funny how out of touch they look
2016-01-31 16:26:27	RyanSmallwood	like their videos are trying so hard to say we want to support creators and help people out but the message is so obviously, everyone should start paying us for this idea that isn't ours
2016-01-31 16:26:33	Porkepik	Haha, well, I never really liked their look ...
2016-01-31 16:27:06	Porkepik	They look like that "Reagan" american family, going to church every sunday and never using the word "fuck" :P (nothing against religion or people being more polite tho)

2016-01-31 16:46:05	RyanSmallwood	it depends who mean
2016-01-31 16:46:18	RyanSmallwood	like I agree than the vast majority of their viewers won't know anything happened
2016-01-31 16:46:38	RyanSmallwood	most people probably just click links on their social media and don't watch every video
2016-01-31 16:46:47	RyanSmallwood	but things do circulate through certain loyal followers
2016-01-31 16:47:08	RyanSmallwood	and if they lose the confidence of the people who pay the most attention to their channel that does have a noticeable impact
2016-01-31 16:47:40	Porkepik	On the moment
2016-01-31 16:47:49	Porkepik	in 3 months, they will have won back what they lost
2016-01-31 16:47:58	Porkepik	It's something known in business
2016-01-31 16:49:06	RyanSmallwood	partly depends on how they act going forward
2016-01-31 16:49:37	Porkepik	As it always was
2016-01-31 16:49:43	Porkepik	It's about keeping being relevant
2016-01-31 16:49:57	Porkepik	It's just gonna be harder than before now that some people won't follow them anymore
2016-01-31 16:50:05	Porkepik	Doesn't mean it's gonna be a permanent change tho
2016-01-31 16:50:59	RyanSmallwood	if they're smart and forget about it probably
2016-01-31 16:51:11	RyanSmallwood	they could end up dragging it out if they keep doubling down
2016-01-31 16:54:12	Porkepik	HAHAHAHA

2016-01-31 16:54:27	Porkepik	React World = Burger King SeemsGood
2016-01-31 16:54:29	Porkepik	Got it
2016-01-31 16:55:20	RyanSmallwood	sounds to me like... we know this is bad comparison because we don't want to sound like a big cooperation... but the only analogy we can think of is a big cooperation...

2016-01-31 17:06:48	Porkepik	How dumb do you need to be ? Why do they think the new generation is on the internet so much ? To avoid TV ...

2016-01-31 17:08:07	Porkepik	I like drama, you take food and a drink, and it's the best show of the moment
2016-01-31 17:08:31	RyanSmallwood	I mean it makes sense to try to expand their business by getting more people to create more of their videos in more languages and stuff, but why don't they  hmmm pay people to make videos for them instead of asking for money to use their format....
2016-01-31 17:08:42	Porkepik	Watched anything lately will ?
2016-01-31 17:10:02	Porkepik	Wooo ! Good news ! I'm gonna be able to watch Wrong Man tonight ! Now we gotta hope that damn Vertigo torrent is gonna seed ...
2016-01-31 17:10:10	RyanSmallwood	heh
2016-01-31 17:10:26	Porkepik	I have the french DVD but I want some high quality for i t
2016-01-31 17:10:54	Porkepik	Btw, is vertigo used in the sense of "fear of height" in this case or when you're not feeling well ?
2016-01-31 17:11:08	RyanSmallwood	fear of heights
2016-01-31 17:11:10	thewillmatic__	Porkepik: lets see… i saw My Own Private Idaho a few days ago but thats it. ive actually been listening to a ton of music lately. a lot of french electro, too.
2016-01-31 17:11:22	Porkepik	Isn't the movie that used for the first time the effect in Jaws ?
2016-01-31 17:11:34	Porkepik	When the camera go back but keep the same focus ? Or something like that
2016-01-31 17:11:45	Porkepik	or the same depth of field, dunno which term is correct
2016-01-31 17:11:53	RyanSmallwood	dolly zoom or zolly
2016-01-31 17:11:59	Porkepik	Yeah that one
2016-01-31 17:12:04	RyanSmallwood	you dolly in while zooming out, or your zoom out while dollying in
2016-01-31 17:12:42	Porkepik	Oh yeah
2016-01-31 17:12:54	RyanSmallwood	my favorite Hitchcocks are probably Vertigo and The Birds
2016-01-31 17:13:25	Porkepik	It's too hard to choose one Hitchock
2016-01-31 17:13:43	Porkepik	I might allow myself to put 2 movies for one director in my favorite, just for my prefered filmmakers
2016-01-31 17:14:07	Porkepik	thewillmatic__ => What artists ?
2016-01-31 17:15:06	thewillmatic__	Porkepik: SebastiAn (i love his sound, its so unique), Ettiene de Crecy, Oizo, Cassius, Le Knight Club, various Ed Banger mixes
2016-01-31 17:15:24	thewillmatic__	i love french house and french electro. its so fresh sounding. by far my favorite type of electronic music
2016-01-31 17:15:46	thewillmatic__	if you have any recommendations i would be happy to listen
2016-01-31 17:17:17	Porkepik	Well, if you already know everybody in Ed Banger, you can try Danger, Jabberwocky, Point Point, Modjo
2016-01-31 17:17:30	thewillmatic__	oh and classic Daft Punk (i think homework is their best album)
2016-01-31 17:17:35	Porkepik	They don't have many songs tho, but they're great I think
2016-01-31 17:17:40	Porkepik	Ha ! Me too !
2016-01-31 17:17:43	thewillmatic__	yeah i dont know about everyone in Ed Banger yet so ill check them out
2016-01-31 17:17:45	Porkepik	My favorite electronic music album !
2016-01-31 17:17:51	thewillmatic__	high five! lol
2016-01-31 17:17:53	Porkepik	Do you know Justice ?
2016-01-31 17:18:00	Porkepik	It's my favorite artist (band)
2016-01-31 17:18:08	thewillmatic__	yeah hes one of the guys im giving a listen to
2016-01-31 17:18:39	Porkepik	I think they're geniuses honestly, I just love how they changed so much with electronic music
2016-01-31 17:18:50	Porkepik	Like Daft Punk, they were a big step in the genre
2016-01-31 17:18:51	thewillmatic__	Justice or French Touch in general?
2016-01-31 17:19:22	Porkepik	Well, Justice mostly, but obviously the French electronic music scene has inspired a lot of artists
2016-01-31 17:19:25	thewillmatic__	also do french people call it “French Touch” or do you guys just call it music?
2016-01-31 17:19:35	Porkepik	As the UK scene did, that's the 2 biggest countries when it comes to electronic
2016-01-31 17:20:11	Porkepik	We just say "musique électronique" and eventually "French house" but that's more of a subgenre, not a term for electronic music
2016-01-31 17:20:22	Porkepik	not a term for french electronic music*
2016-01-31 17:20:24	Porkepik	sorry
2016-01-31 17:20:32	Porkepik	What I meant is that we don't really give a name to french electronic
2016-01-31 17:20:38	thewillmatic__	i see
2016-01-31 17:26:10	Porkepik	Also, Carpenter Brut is great, he made a few songs for the game Hotline Miami 2
2016-01-31 17:26:26	Porkepik	Anyway, tons of french, not hard to find them
2016-01-31 17:26:45	Porkepik	Just bait one with a lot of distortion and disco samples :D
2016-01-31 17:31:58	thewillmatic__	is Cherokee any good?
2016-01-31 17:32:46	Porkepik	Listened to them a while ago, but very quickly
2016-01-31 17:32:52	Porkepik	So can't really tell you
2016-01-31 17:33:00	Porkepik	I guess the few I listen to didn't work much on me
2016-01-31 17:46:39	@indeedwatson	HM2 has a great soundtrack
2016-01-31 17:48:25	@Carson	I'm trying to find some hobbies

2016-01-31 17:48:44	Porkepik	Get into photography !
2016-01-31 17:48:55	@Carson	i'd love to do that too
2016-01-31 17:49:12	@Carson	my dad and uncle are photographer s
2016-01-31 17:49:25	@Carson	and stepdad, he does mostly underwater scuba photos
2016-01-31 17:49:47	@Carson	my dad has a legit darkroom in his house
2016-01-31 17:52:25	@Carson	porkepik I also took 3 photography classes in college, I have a Nikon D100, but I don't like it all, old and slow
2016-01-31 17:53:01	@Carson	really would like to get a new camera though
2016-01-31 17:53:02	Porkepik	I have a Nikon D5100
2016-01-31 17:53:48	@Carson	would you recommend one?
2016-01-31 17:54:14	Porkepik	The D5100 ?
2016-01-31 17:54:22	Porkepik	Depends, I guess there is better as of now, it's years old
2016-01-31 17:54:26	@Carson	anything
2016-01-31 17:54:42	Porkepik	For that, I wouldn't dare, I'm still new to it and I only know Nikon :/
2016-01-31 17:54:44	@Carson	looking good quality at a low price
2016-01-31 17:54:47	Porkepik	Many people prefer Canon
2016-01-31 17:55:03	@Carson	okay thanks
2016-01-31 17:55:18	@Carson	I might study chess
2016-01-31 17:55:24	Porkepik	If you have a specific budget and you know what you're looking to shoot mostly, you can try to start a thread of a specialist forum or a subreddit
2016-01-31 17:55:29	@Carson	I also caught a lizard in the backyard
2016-01-31 17:55:41	Porkepik	Is he still alive ?
2016-01-31 17:55:45	@Carson	I thought it would be fun to have a reptile collection
2016-01-31 17:55:46	@Carson	yes
2016-01-31 17:55:58	Porkepik	I'm passionate about moths
2016-01-31 17:56:00	@Carson	but not keeping them, my girlfriend wouldn't like it
2016-01-31 17:56:08	Porkepik	but dunno if I'm gonna have a "collection" of them
2016-01-31 17:56:16	@Carson	live or dead?
2016-01-31 17:56:23	Porkepik	Well, I prefer them alive :D
2016-01-31 17:56:38	@Carson	my dad is a huge stamp collector
2016-01-31 17:56:40	Porkepik	And the collection, well, a dead one wouldn't be very interesting, but why not
2016-01-31 17:56:43	Porkepik	Tho, raising moths isn't that hard
2016-01-31 17:56:46	Porkepik	So I would like to try
2016-01-31 17:56:50	@Carson	I don't really want to collect anything though, takes up too much space
2016-01-31 17:57:08	@Carson	I might make my own kombucha (fermented tea)
2016-01-31 17:57:27	@indeedwatson	collect digital data!
2016-01-31 17:57:36	@Carson	i do lol

2016-02-02 15:01:53	scarlett_	i think there are some great themes in it though
2016-02-02 15:02:04	scarlett_	the love of his son is great, especially during those times
2016-02-02 15:02:18	scarlett_	because he looks like a native, and to see everyone elses racism towards his son
2016-02-02 15:02:37	scarlett_	and you cant help but think i mean if this guy wasn't his son, would leo be racist just like the rest of them? probably
2016-02-02 15:03:05	scarlett_	and i think stripping all of us to survival shows us we are all people
2016-02-02 15:03:27	scarlett_	and you'd much rather run into a human than a bear!
2016-02-02 15:03:46	scarlett_	i found the scene when he meets the random native
2016-02-02 15:03:57	scarlett_	eating a dead animal
2016-02-02 15:04:11	scarlett_	and he basically has to communicate like animals ourselves
2016-02-02 15:04:26	scarlett_	and it also made me think most human conflict
2016-02-02 15:04:45	scarlett_	is just 'misunderstandings'  difficulty with communication
2016-02-02 15:05:02	scarlett_	even though we have language, it's still very hard to communicate

2016-02-02 15:06:24	@indeedwatson	i don't think it was explicitely stated, and he told him repeatedly "you're my son", i thought precisely because he wasn't
2016-02-02 15:06:33	scarlett_	i think he was saying that cause it was his son
2016-02-02 15:06:37	scarlett_	they show all the women at the camp
2016-02-02 15:06:40	scarlett_	and i think they say something about his wife

2016-02-02 15:07:00	Mothravka	scarlett_: Yeah, they put out some nice stuff now and then. Arrow are quite diverse and have several sub-labels. You can use Google if you want to find out more.
2016-02-02 15:07:06	scarlett_	i mean you saw the whole movie
2016-02-02 15:07:14	scarlett_	Mothravka: cool
2016-02-02 15:07:19	@indeedwatson	well my friend also did and he thought the same as you
2016-02-02 15:07:24	scarlett_	oh okay
2016-02-02 15:07:30	scarlett_	well i dont think it's important
2016-02-02 15:07:33	Mothravka	This was some other news as well: http://www.arrowfilms.co.uk/shop/index.php?route=product/product&path=79_96&product_id=702
2016-02-02 15:07:34		[ http://is.gd/iYc6Hx ]
2016-02-02 15:07:46	scarlett_	to him it was completely real
2016-02-02 15:07:47	Mothravka	Interesting, a nice little film by Weerasethakul on Blu-ray as well.
2016-02-02 15:07:56	@indeedwatson	but he said "leo looked a bit young to be the father of a teenager" and when i said what i just told you he said "oh you're right"
2016-02-02 15:09:33	scarlett_	who is hostile towards Glass's half-native son Hawk,
2016-02-02 15:09:36	scarlett_	he is his son
2016-02-02 15:10:00	scarlett_	although that's from wiki
2016-02-02 15:10:05	scarlett_	there are probably better sources
2016-02-02 15:10:19	scarlett_	i think your conclusion is more of a stretch
2016-02-02 15:10:25	scarlett_	there is no indication to think he is adopted
2016-02-02 15:10:41	scarlett_	him repeating him you're my son doesn't make me think he is adopted really
2016-02-02 15:10:58	scarlett_	maybe especially considering his party is racist
2016-02-02 15:11:02	scarlett_	i mean not his party everyone lol
2016-02-02 15:11:18	@indeedwatson	dunno to me it's weird stating something obvious
2016-02-02 15:11:19	scarlett_	the whole idea of these ppl were that they were superior to natives
2016-02-02 15:11:31	scarlett_	do you realize how shit they thought natives were
2016-02-02 15:11:34	scarlett_	savages
2016-02-02 15:11:38	scarlett_	worse than animals
2016-02-02 15:12:06	scarlett_	they were extremely xenophobic hateful people in that regard
2016-02-02 15:12:22	scarlett_	his own party and community didnt consider himself like a real son
2016-02-02 15:12:28	scarlett_	because he's half native
2016-02-02 15:12:34	scarlett_	the racism is a big part in that movie
2016-02-02 15:12:44	scarlett_	a theme
2016-02-02 15:13:16	@indeedwatson	i don't think it's as much a theme as just part of the setting
2016-02-02 15:13:22	scarlett_	i think it defnitely is
2016-02-02 15:13:28	scarlett_	lol
2016-02-02 15:13:36	scarlett_	but i would also expect people to downplay that
2016-02-02 15:13:48	scarlett_	as is the common narrative with the mainstream white population
2016-02-02 15:14:06	scarlett_	desperate to call out "no racism" on everything lol
2016-02-02 15:14:49	@indeedwatson	it's not a major theme of the film, it is related to Glass but the movie doesn't say anything interesting or new about it
2016-02-02 15:15:04	scarlett_	it is a major theme imo
2016-02-02 15:15:20	scarlett_	did you say Class?
2016-02-02 15:15:25	@indeedwatson	Glass
2016-02-02 15:15:36	scarlett_	whos Glass
2016-02-02 15:15:37	@indeedwatson	Leo's character's name
2016-02-02 15:15:47	scarlett_	oh gotcha
2016-02-02 15:15:53	@indeedwatson	i don't think you can comment on the film's major themes if you barely saw the movie :p
2016-02-02 15:16:08	scarlett_	...
2016-02-02 15:16:15	@indeedwatson	I don't think it had much to say about anything, and what it did it spelled it out pretty clear
2016-02-02 15:16:27	scarlett_	you don't know how much i saw the film
2016-02-02 15:16:36	@indeedwatson	it was one of my major gripes of it
2016-02-02 15:16:41	@indeedwatson	well you said you slept through most of it
2016-02-02 15:16:44	scarlett_	and even from however much i saw it i could have gotten far more out of the film than someone else
2016-02-02 15:16:58	scarlett_	but yeah it's all just ad hominem
2016-02-02 15:17:11	@indeedwatson	it's not ad hominem!
2016-02-02 15:17:22	@indeedwatson	you said yourself you didn't see most of it
2016-02-02 15:17:29	scarlett_	you don't understand what ad hominem is then
2016-02-02 15:17:59	@indeedwatson	 is an attack on an argument made by attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument,
2016-02-02 15:18:08	@indeedwatson	i didn't say anything about your character or motives
2016-02-02 15:18:21	@indeedwatson	i just restated what you said earlier, that you didn't watch most of the movie
2016-02-02 15:18:25	scarlett_	if you cant understand lol
2016-02-02 15:18:29	Porkepik	"[19:00] <scarlett_> ya i think i told you i slept through most of it"
2016-02-02 15:18:32	scarlett_	there's no point trying to get you to understand it
2016-02-02 15:18:36	Porkepik	Tho, he has a right to have an opinion on it
2016-02-02 15:18:40	@indeedwatson	that is a non argument
2016-02-02 15:18:46	Porkepik	He can comment on something if he wants
2016-02-02 15:18:59	Porkepik	Now, the fact that he slept through most of it could mean he didn't get some parts of the movie
2016-02-02 15:19:02	@indeedwatson	sure but it will be with lacking in facts
2016-02-02 15:19:09	Porkepik	But I don't think you can prevent someone from freedom of expression
2016-02-02 15:19:22	Porkepik	We are always lacking a little bit of context
2016-02-02 15:19:43	@indeedwatson	im saying the movie has racism in it, but it doesn't say anything interesting about it
2016-02-02 15:19:57	@indeedwatson	and something being in a movie doesn't mean the movie is about that
2016-02-02 15:20:43	scarlett_	too bad you're an op here

2016-02-02 15:27:12	Mothravka	Hah. What happened?!
2016-02-02 15:28:07	@indeedwatson	scarlett fell asleep watching the revenant and then got offended that i didn't think the movie was about racism and that i'm an op and left
2016-02-02 15:28:34	Mothravka	Yeah, I saw that. I was just stunned. Hah.
2016-02-02 15:29:36	@indeedwatson	Mothravka: have you seen it?
2016-02-02 15:29:42	Mothravka	Yeah.
2016-02-02 15:30:14	@indeedwatson	what did you think?
2016-02-02 15:30:45	Mothravka	It wasn't bad. But I think I want to rewatch it again.
2016-02-02 15:31:12	@indeedwatson	I'm really happy i got to see it in IMAX
2016-02-02 15:31:17	@indeedwatson	and that it wasn't 3D
2016-02-02 15:33:17	Mothravka	I also have to say that the movie doesn't seem to have any bigger context about racism at all. It touches the subject a tiny bit, but I would say that it's very far from one of the major themes. And in my opinion, it didn't really say anything interesting about it or go anywhere further with it, just like you said.
2016-02-02 15:35:00	@indeedwatson	glad i'm not alone
2016-02-02 15:35:49	@indeedwatson	I think some people take the mere mention or inclusion of racism (or other touchy subjects) as movies being about it
2016-02-02 15:35:51	@indeedwatson	it's weird
2016-02-02 15:38:31	@indeedwatson	It seems the fine brothers took a step back
2016-02-02 15:38:59	Mothravka	Yeah, I think there's a big distinction between a film that just touches a subject, mentions it or includes it, and film that has a subject as a big main theme, goes deep into it as well as exploring it on a deeper level.
2016-02-02 15:40:32	@indeedwatson	I don't think the revenant went very deep into any subject whatsoever heh
2016-02-02 15:40:39	@indeedwatson	but it was compelling either way
2016-02-02 15:43:53	Mothravka	To me, it was pretty much a survival/revenge story that didn't really have that much to say, but it was engaging.

2016-02-02 16:00:41	RyanSmallwood	Porkepik: what did you think of the best movie ever made according to Sight and Sound?
2016-02-02 16:02:17	Porkepik	Well, I don't know what Sight and Sound is so I don't know if I should care too much about their ranking
2016-02-02 16:02:29	Porkepik	But it was amazing, I was blown away
2016-02-02 16:02:37	RyanSmallwood	:D :D :D
2016-02-02 16:02:53	Porkepik	I was talking about The wrong man being a little bit more "experimental" but Vertigo almost look like arthouse Hitchcock
2016-02-02 16:03:06	Porkepik	My favorite so far (with Rebecca and Rear Window)
2016-02-02 16:03:27	RyanSmallwood	yeah that's my favorite side of hitchcock
2016-02-02 16:04:59	RyanSmallwood	by the by, Sight and Sound does a critics poll of their favorite films, and they've done it every 10 years going back to 1952
2016-02-02 16:05:23	RyanSmallwood	so its probably the most major critics poll to get a sense of what critics think the best movies ever made are
2016-02-02 16:06:13	Porkepik	Critics all around the world ?
2016-02-02 16:06:15	Porkepik	Or british ?
2016-02-02 16:06:35	RyanSmallwood	It was  Bicycle Thieves in 1952, then Citizen Kane held onto #1 from 62-2002, and then the most recent poll in 2012 Vertigo took #1 from Citizen Kane, it was a big deal
2016-02-02 16:06:39	Porkepik	It's weird how in 1952 "Bicycle Thieves" was the first one then disappeared
2016-02-02 16:06:45	RyanSmallwood	hmm, I'm not sure, but I think it was around the world
2016-02-02 16:07:25	RyanSmallwood	well 50s was when there started being lots more writing, scholarly work,and archiving for films
2016-02-02 16:07:44	RyanSmallwood	I'm sure in 52 there wasn't as clear a consensus as in later decades, the canon was still forming

2016-02-02 16:16:49	Mothravka	I think it's a very good movie, easily my favourite Hitchcock together with Rear Window (1954), but for me, the end could also be a lot better than it is.
2016-02-02 16:16:50	@indeedwatson	could be, I watched Vertigo in "isolation" cause I don't think I've seen any hitchcock in a while

2016-02-02 16:24:55	Porkepik	An ad hominem seems to be when someone is attacking the person instead of his argument
2016-02-02 16:25:15	Porkepik	Then, I'm not sure of what I got of the definition, I just learned the word
2016-02-02 16:25:49	RyanSmallwood	yeah its if you shift the argument to the person's character instead of addressing their point
2016-02-02 16:25:50	@indeedwatson	yeah, it is attacking a person or a trait or something about them, irrelevant to the argument
2016-02-02 16:26:36	Porkepik	He doesn't know your color, he wasn't addressing you at this point, to me
2016-02-02 16:26:46	Porkepik	I think, I don't have the full context
2016-02-02 16:27:27	@indeedwatson	i didn't say it was an ad hominem against me, i was saying i found it ironic they accused me of ad hominem, and earlier made a remark about a person's colors invalidating their arguments
2016-02-02 16:28:08	RyanSmallwood	its not that ad hominem is something you should never do or say, its when its used in an argument to shift the discussion
2016-02-02 16:28:29	Porkepik	Well, he is just talking about white men not wanting to admit racism, it does exist
2016-02-02 16:28:44	RyanSmallwood	its perfectly fine to comment on trends and question possible motivations as long as you're not telling a person their opinion doesn't matter because of some quality about them
2016-02-02 16:28:55	@indeedwatson	and doesn't that shift the discussion from whether Revenant is about racism or isn't?
2016-02-02 16:30:06	RyanSmallwood	no because the way it was said
2016-02-02 16:30:48	RyanSmallwood	its okay to question motivations outside of the argument, an ad hominem attack is "you're just saying that because you are _____" but its perfectly fine to have that thought and to ask "do you think ____ might be biasing your opinion?"
2016-02-02 16:31:00	@indeedwatson	I feel if the movie is about something, you should be able to explain why talking about the movie, not about trends based on color
2016-02-02 16:31:20	RyanSmallwood	well other people might want different things out of movie discussions
2016-02-02 16:31:54	@indeedwatson	but if the movie isn't about racism, then the racism talk is shifting the conversation
2016-02-02 16:32:17	@indeedwatson	because you skipped the step where you at least tried to prove that the theme is actually important to the movie
2016-02-02 16:32:40	Porkepik	Well, being from a country or another may change your opinion on a movie
2016-02-02 16:32:53	RyanSmallwood	its totally valid to say you think a movie is about racism
2016-02-02 16:32:56	Porkepik	And in a way, the color of your skin may affect where you are from, or your culture
2016-02-02 16:33:00	RyanSmallwood	that's not shifting the argument that's stating your opinon
2016-02-02 16:33:12	Porkepik	I mean, it does not affect
2016-02-02 16:33:17	Porkepik	But it's a consequence of it
2016-02-02 16:33:29	@indeedwatson	but anyone can state an opinion about anything, that doesn't make for interesting discussion unless you elaborate
2016-02-02 16:34:10	RyanSmallwood	well yeah, you can ask people to elaborate if you don't know where they're coming from of course
2016-02-02 16:34:14	@indeedwatson	i tried to elaborate why i didn't think it was important in the film and he just shut me down with non-arguments
2016-02-02 16:34:45	RyanSmallwood	I think he or she was just explaining why the idea was important to them, not trying to shut down your perspective
2016-02-02 16:35:32	@indeedwatson	but i dont particularly care about where they're coming from because I like to discuss the movie
2016-02-02 16:35:47	@indeedwatson	i mean, i do care, when i asked things like whats up or about their workout and stuff
2016-02-02 16:35:50	RyanSmallwood	okay well you can just allow them to have their own opinion :)
2016-02-02 16:35:52	Porkepik	Except doesn't that may affect their view on the movie ? As I said ?
2016-02-02 16:36:02	Porkepik	I'm french and I know I can struggle to understand some movie cause of my origin
2016-02-02 16:36:09	@indeedwatson	 scarlett_ | if you cant understand lol
2016-02-02 16:36:13	@indeedwatson	 scarlett_ | there's no point trying to get you to understand it      
2016-02-02 16:36:20	Porkepik	Since for example I don't know much about Japanese history
2016-02-02 16:36:21	@indeedwatson	that was pretty condescending
2016-02-02 16:36:58	Porkepik	So I would like someone to take into account that I'm french so maybe it could help me understand my opinion better
2016-02-02 16:37:04	Porkepik	And explain why I may have struggle to like the movie
2016-02-02 16:37:09	@indeedwatson	Porkepik: but we can discuss it and you probably won't throw a fit and leave
2016-02-02 16:37:29	@indeedwatson	as we have with other subjects and stuff
2016-02-02 16:37:31	Porkepik	for example : "Oh well, I guess it's because I know a lot about japanese history, maybe you shoul read that thing or that thing to better understand it, if you're interested" no ?
2016-02-02 16:37:34	RyanSmallwood	again it might differ depending on personal experience
2016-02-02 16:38:10	RyanSmallwood	if they deal with that in real life and in lots of discussions they may choose not want to explain themselves in detail all the time if they don't think the environment is conducive to that kind of discussion
2016-02-02 16:38:43	@indeedwatson	well then perhaps discussing movies is not a place for them in the first place, if they can't put their personal feelings appart
2016-02-02 16:38:51	@indeedwatson	for example
2016-02-02 16:39:04	@indeedwatson	during the movie i thought a lot about my dad, who i lost about a year ago
2016-02-02 16:39:05	Porkepik	Well, I know I almost left this place definitly cause of that, yeah :/
2016-02-02 16:39:09	@indeedwatson	so it touched me a bit on a personal level
2016-02-02 16:39:17	@indeedwatson	but i wouldn't say the movie is strongly about fatherhood
2016-02-02 16:39:55	Mothravka	http://33.media.tumblr.com/daa5782ea7bab51742e351457fcc3d48/tumblr_mlscg1JDjB1qiz3j8o1_500.gif
2016-02-02 16:39:56		[ http://is.gd/HaMu7K ]
2016-02-02 16:39:56	RyanSmallwood	but if you did say that I wouldn't feel comfortable asking you to back up your claim and telling you your theory is invalid for being too personal
2016-02-02 16:40:14	@indeedwatson	but you should feel comfortable
2016-02-02 16:40:25	@indeedwatson	because that's the point of discussing movies
2016-02-02 16:40:26	RyanSmallwood	I don't think so
2016-02-02 16:41:00	@indeedwatson	who's that Mothravka ?
2016-02-02 16:41:07	Mothravka	The master.
2016-02-02 16:41:13	Mothravka	Robert Bresson.
2016-02-02 16:42:13	@indeedwatson	RyanSmallwood: my point in the first place is that a film can make me feel something but I'm not gonna state as a fact "the film is about this" because it touched me personally, because I know the film exists outside of my experience with it
2016-02-02 16:42:40	RyanSmallwood	I dunno if you said the film was about fatherhood, that seems like a valid claim to make
2016-02-02 16:42:45	RyanSmallwood	fatherhood is a big part of the film
2016-02-02 16:43:09	@indeedwatson	i think it is a bigger part than racism, but i don't think it's the major theme
2016-02-02 16:43:33	@indeedwatson	it's more of a narrative device to fuel the overall message, which is revenge 
2016-02-02 16:44:18	RyanSmallwood	its tricky because people have different definitions of what they mean by theme
2016-02-02 16:44:33	RyanSmallwood	and that's a whole huge philosophical knot to untangle
2016-02-02 16:45:16	@indeedwatson	I think it would be more interesting applied to another film, because The Revenant has its characters verbalize what it is about
2016-02-02 16:46:19	Porkepik	I stopped trying to understand what a movie was talking about, I just enjoy the pretty pictures and sounds
2016-02-02 16:46:39	@indeedwatson	i like both
2016-02-02 16:46:49	Porkepik	Then, sometimes, it seems deeper and it's cool, but since I'm a kid, I'm a big fan of poetry
2016-02-02 16:47:02	Porkepik	And poetry can be deep, but most of the time, it's just about pretty words and descriptions
2016-02-02 16:47:12	@indeedwatson	the best is when the what and the how work together
2016-02-02 16:50:10	RyanSmallwood	I think a lot of online film communities tend to insulate themselves from certain perspectives, and if new members come here wanting to discuss different aspects we should not necessarily assume that those aspects are uninteresting  just because we don't find them interesting ourselves,   and I think it would be better not to try to make that discu
2016-02-02 16:50:10	RyanSmallwood	ssion feel like its out of bounds, and if it doesn't interest someone it might be better just to not engage in the discussion rather than try to moderate whats a valid way to discuss a film
2016-02-02 16:52:46	@indeedwatson	it's not out of bounds, it's just that the discussion was first about whether the film is about racism or not. Scarlett just stated it, as a fact, not even opinion. And then proceeded under the assumption that it was about racism, without even having seem most of the movie. If we were talking about American History X then it would be completely relevant
2016-02-02 16:53:38	Porkepik	American History X is about a kid learning how to do his homework ! :D
2016-02-02 16:53:43	@indeedwatson	hahah
2016-02-02 16:54:52	@indeedwatson	i don't particularly feel anything is out of bounds actually
2016-02-02 16:56:36	RyanSmallwood	<scarlett_> i think there are some great themes in it though
2016-02-02 16:56:36	RyanSmallwood	<scarlett_> the racism is a big part in that movie
2016-02-02 16:56:36	RyanSmallwood	<scarlett_> a theme
2016-02-02 16:56:36	RyanSmallwood	<indeedwatson> i don't think it's as much a theme as just part of the setting
2016-02-02 16:56:37	RyanSmallwood	<scarlett_> i think it defnitely is
2016-02-02 16:56:37	RyanSmallwood	<scarlett_> lol
2016-02-02 16:56:37	RyanSmallwood	<indeedwatson> it's not a major theme of the film, it is related to Glass but the movie doesn't say anything interesting or new about it
2016-02-02 16:56:37	RyanSmallwood	<scarlett_> it is a major theme imo
2016-02-02 16:57:05	RyanSmallwood	I dunno I think he or she was sticking pretty clearly on the "I think" side of things
2016-02-02 16:57:56	@indeedwatson	i guess
2016-02-02 16:58:02	@indeedwatson	but still failed to elaborate
2016-02-02 17:01:10	Porkepik	"i think" "imo"
2016-02-02 17:01:16	Porkepik	Yeah, he was stating his opinion
2016-02-02 17:01:47	Porkepik	He failed to elaborate but does he need to ? Do we always need to explain our opinions ? It's preferable to most people, but is it mandatory ?
2016-02-02 17:02:05	@indeedwatson	no, of course not, nothing is mandatory
2016-02-02 17:02:05	RyanSmallwood	I mean in any discussion its tricky to know what level to elaborate on and how much, I think if you're curious to know someones side you can ask them questions to expand their viewpoints, if there's a mismatch of criteria of for what example a theme is telling them they're wrong  based on different criteria can sometimes come across as hostile  its
2016-02-02 17:02:06	RyanSmallwood	 better to try and lay out your terms first and see where you're disagreement stems from
2016-02-02 17:02:38	@indeedwatson	but it is uninteresting because there's nothing to learn from it, it is the equivalent of "what's the best underrated movie" posts from r/movies where they just make 1 sentence comments listing movies
2016-02-02 17:03:31	Porkepik	To you
2016-02-02 17:03:57	@indeedwatson	well, it is the basis for truefilm
2016-02-02 17:04:01	@indeedwatson	discussion
2016-02-02 17:04:02	Porkepik	People can be interested in surprising things, you know, we don't really choose what our mind wants to focus on
2016-02-02 17:05:09	Porkepik	"Discussion" doesn't mean much to me
2016-02-02 17:05:15	@indeedwatson	and discussion about film, not about feelings :p
2016-02-02 17:05:20	Porkepik	Except "no images or links"
2016-02-02 17:05:48	@indeedwatson	 1.
2016-02-02 17:05:48	@indeedwatson	an act or instance of discussing; consideration or examination by argument, comment, etc., especially to explore solutions; informal debate.
2016-02-02 17:06:03	@indeedwatson	well the sub has a rule about low effort comments and length afaik
2016-02-02 17:06:15	Porkepik	It's still a very general and vague definition
2016-02-02 17:06:51	@indeedwatson	i think it's clear enough that stating a 3 word opinion and not elaborating doesn't qualify as discussion
2016-02-02 17:06:53	Porkepik	But is there a precise comment on the length necessary ?
2016-02-02 17:07:04	Porkepik	What's a low effort comment to you ? To the /r/truefilm mods ?
2016-02-02 17:07:29	@indeedwatson	to me, "this movie is about X. Period" is low effort
2016-02-02 17:07:37	@indeedwatson	i wouldn't know about the mods
2016-02-02 17:07:46	@indeedwatson	but in the  sub it's a rule
2016-02-02 17:07:48	@indeedwatson	it's not here
2016-02-02 17:07:55	@indeedwatson	i'm just saying i don't find it interesting
2016-02-02 17:09:10	RyanSmallwood	I think those issues can be better addressed by asking them to expand on their points though
2016-02-02 17:09:26	@indeedwatson	well everyone's got their way of arguing
2016-02-02 17:09:37	@indeedwatson	mine is to lay down my point 
2016-02-02 17:09:41	@indeedwatson	that way you can address it
2016-02-02 17:09:48	Porkepik	Which can be boring and uninteresting to some people :P
2016-02-02 17:10:04	@indeedwatson	but at least it's not low effort!
2016-02-02 17:10:08	Porkepik	To you
2016-02-02 17:10:30	Porkepik	So far the only defition I got from you is : 3+ words :D
2016-02-02 17:10:35	@indeedwatson	see, that's another low effort comment :p
2016-02-02 17:10:48	Porkepik	Damn, was one word away :(
2016-02-02 17:10:56	@indeedwatson	I spent some time watching the movie, tihnking about it while i watched it, and thought about it afterwards
2016-02-02 17:11:01	@indeedwatson	and watched a few reviews
2016-02-02 17:11:11	@indeedwatson	and took the time to write some thoughts in letterboxd
2016-02-02 17:11:28	Porkepik	Yeah, which would be a cool thing to 99% of the population on letterboxd and reddit I guess
2016-02-02 17:11:29	@indeedwatson	that is objectively more effort than "it is about x", at least at face value
2016-02-02 17:11:48	@indeedwatson	im not saying my observations are true or insightful or interesting
2016-02-02 17:11:51	Porkepik	If you're talking about length, yeah, but I wouldn't know if it is "objectively more effort"
2016-02-02 17:11:53	@indeedwatson	but im saying i tried
2016-02-02 17:12:16	@indeedwatson	well it is, you can measure the amount of work both take 
2016-02-02 17:12:37	Porkepik	"amount of work" is that a real value ? Are we talking time spend ?
2016-02-02 17:13:05	@indeedwatson	time, thought, yes
2016-02-02 17:13:25	Porkepik	Maybe typing those 3 words took them a longer time than your 300 words :D
2016-02-02 17:13:38	@indeedwatson	it didn't because it was a live discussion
2016-02-02 17:13:54	Porkepik	And they had to spend more moneys cause they broke their keyboard after the second letter of second word :/
2016-02-02 17:14:05	@indeedwatson	that is unrelated :p
2016-02-02 17:18:35	RyanSmallwood	I dunno, I think there are better ways to go about it
2016-02-02 17:18:59	»	Porkepikk (~AndChat60@ARouen-652-1-320-192.w90-22.abo.wanadoo.fr) has joined ##truefilm
2016-02-02 17:19:33	@indeedwatson	better how?
2016-02-02 17:20:27	RyanSmallwood	I just think a lot of film discussions progress rather aggressively not realizing how long actually refuting someone's argument and questioning all the thousands of assumptions behind them
2016-02-02 17:21:02	RyanSmallwood	I think its better to not necessarily be so quick to refute the other person unless you both are willing to go into a really long discussion about it and define your terms in detail
2016-02-02 17:21:17	RyanSmallwood	people bring very different perspectives, definitions and motivations to watching
2016-02-02 17:21:39	RyanSmallwood	I think the most helpful way to discuss films is to try to listen to the other person's perspective, and then lay out clearly your perspective
2016-02-02 17:21:48	RyanSmallwood	and then elaborate if there's misunderstanding
2016-02-02 17:22:00	RyanSmallwood	because there are so many assumptions that would have to be refuted to get to the bottom of a discussion
2016-02-02 17:22:18	@indeedwatson	perhaps i'm just spoiled by chats where you don't need to have the listening and the speaking be on clear cut, separate moments
2016-02-02 17:23:13	@indeedwatson	for example I started typing that, then stopped when you wrote another sentence, read it, and finished writing
2016-02-02 17:23:25	RyanSmallwood	heh
2016-02-02 17:23:35	@indeedwatson	but see you have a point
2016-02-02 17:23:39	@indeedwatson	and you're making it clear
2016-02-02 17:26:06	RyanSmallwood	I also think its helpful to try to be charitable in interpreting other people's explanations about film
2016-02-02 17:26:22	RyanSmallwood	Like I personally don't think films really have verbal "themes" at all
2016-02-02 17:26:33	RyanSmallwood	more they're embodiments of situations and those situations have different themes to talk about
2016-02-02 17:26:41	RyanSmallwood	but theme can also be a good shorthand
2016-02-02 17:26:48	RyanSmallwood	so if someone says they see a certain theme in a certain film
2016-02-02 17:27:04	RyanSmallwood	I try not to immediately spring on them with all my pet theories about thematics of film
2016-02-02 17:27:14	RyanSmallwood	but just try to understand how their argument applies in context
2016-02-02 17:27:24	@indeedwatson	yes, but some movies decide to take those themes and make the characters in it, verbalize them
2016-02-02 17:27:38	RyanSmallwood	bad movies :P
2016-02-02 17:27:42	RyanSmallwood	so for example
2016-02-02 17:27:55	RyanSmallwood	in The Revenant, I personally wouldn't want to call race a theme in it
2016-02-02 17:28:02	RyanSmallwood	but the movie has characters with different races
2016-02-02 17:28:11	RyanSmallwood	and alot of the interactions could be said to be racially motivated
2016-02-02 17:28:45	@indeedwatson	of course, that's why i said it features racism, im not denying that at all
2016-02-02 17:28:57	RyanSmallwood	so if someone tells me race is a big theme in the movie to them tryiing to be as charitable as possible I can see how because race is involved in the movie it is an aspect to be discussed and even though I wouldn't call it a theme, if someone else decides to call it a theme quibling over what a theme is is the less important thing
2016-02-02 17:29:27	RyanSmallwood	especially if we haven't spent hundreds of hours talking about what a theme is
2016-02-02 17:29:56	@indeedwatson	i don't think that's necessary
2016-02-02 17:29:57	RyanSmallwood	so rather than diverting the discussion to what is or isn't a theme, I would maybe try to probe to find out more about how they are using theme in this context
2016-02-02 17:30:05	@indeedwatson	otherwise we could never talk about anything
2016-02-02 17:30:46	RyanSmallwood	well I think its about gauging the interest in the conversation
2016-02-02 17:31:13	RyanSmallwood	if someone says race is a theme, we can talk about how themes in movies work, or we can talk about how race in movies work
2016-02-02 17:31:25	@indeedwatson	but we can also disagree
2016-02-02 17:31:29	RyanSmallwood	yea
2016-02-02 17:31:38	@indeedwatson	because those two are general topics
2016-02-02 17:31:45	@indeedwatson	and we were talking about a movie in particular
2016-02-02 17:32:37	@indeedwatson	there was a topic about revenant and realism, and a guy was downvoting for saying valid stuff about the film, but that wasn't related at all to the topic of realism
2016-02-02 17:33:40	RyanSmallwood	well the discussion on truefilm is a lot more structured than in chat
2016-02-02 17:34:10	RyanSmallwood	I think people underestimate how different people's criteria for talking about movies are
2016-02-02 17:37:50	RyanSmallwood	I think a perfectly valid way for a film discussion to proceed is
2016-02-02 17:38:22	RyanSmallwood	Person A lays out there terms, Person B lays out there terms, they find out their criteria is so radically different that there's not much else to discuss and it just ends there
2016-02-02 17:38:37	RyanSmallwood	I lot of people seem in a rush to reconcile the discussion with a debate
2016-02-02 17:38:55	RyanSmallwood	I think there's a time and place for debate, but its not always necessary to go charging forward all the time
2016-02-02 17:39:13	Porkepikk	That's why I thought about not loosing my time there :P
2016-02-02 17:39:33	Porkepikk	But I hace Stockhold Syndrome
2016-02-02 17:39:49	Porkepikk	Stockholm*
2016-02-02 17:39:57	RyanSmallwood	if you're coming from very different starting points and you really want to walk through the long debate, the best way to proceed is to ask them questions about their viewpoint instead of asserting why your viewpoint is the more correct one
2016-02-02 17:40:36	RyanSmallwood	Porkepikk: eh?
2016-02-02 17:41:14	Porkepikk	Uh ?
2016-02-02 17:41:28	RyanSmallwood	why to you have stockholm syndrome?
2016-02-02 17:41:31	RyanSmallwood	*do
2016-02-02 17:41:48	RyanSmallwood	you mean on Truefilm?
2016-02-02 17:42:03	Porkepikk	##truefilm, not on reddit anymore
2016-02-02 17:42:08	Porkepikk	Except for hiphopheads
2016-02-02 17:42:22	Porkepikk	But I just read news and releases
2016-02-02 17:43:11	RyanSmallwood	I don't think I barely recognize anyone here posting on Truefilm... but maybe I'm just not paying attention
2016-02-02 17:44:01	RyanSmallwood	that's why I always feel kind of silly when a newbie comes in and is like "Hey I just start posting on Truefilm, how is everyone?" and I want to be like "yeah uh... we all came here from truefilm at one points... but this place isn't really the same as truefilm... "
2016-02-02 17:44:13	Porkepikk	I was just subscribed to TrueFilm (unsub after being spoiled Caché in a post) and so something about an IRC
2016-02-02 17:44:29	RyanSmallwood	hah and now you're trapped
2016-02-02 17:44:31	Porkepikk	Then I stayed cause I like IRC
2016-02-02 17:44:52	Porkepikk	Honestly, that's mostly cause of the lists
2016-02-02 17:44:53	RyanSmallwood	I'll just keep making lists so you can never escape
2016-02-02 17:44:58	RyanSmallwood	:P
2016-02-02 17:44:58	Porkepikk	Gotta finish them all
2016-02-02 17:45:38	Porkepikk	Well yeah, tho I see you posting from times to times
2016-02-02 17:46:11	RyanSmallwood	I like commenting on things sometimes
2016-02-02 17:46:16	RyanSmallwood	I don't really start my own discussions
2016-02-02 17:46:34	Porkepikk	Yeah, not coming back to the sub after the spoil, I was so pissed ...
2016-02-02 17:46:46	RyanSmallwood	:/
2016-02-02 17:46:52	RyanSmallwood	that's why I would never be a moderator on a film board
2016-02-02 17:46:59	RyanSmallwood	that would suck to be the person in charge of deleting all that
2016-02-02 17:47:07	Porkepikk	Oh yeah
2016-02-02 17:47:50	Porkepikk	I mean, we don't all have the same definition of spoiling, I love watching a movie and only know title and director
2016-02-02 17:48:07	Porkepikk	But that was literally giving sway the ending there ...
2016-02-02 17:48:09	Porkepikk	In the OC
2016-02-02 17:48:42	@indeedwatson	RyanSmallwood: well that's clearly how scarlet felt, that if i didn't agree from the get go, then it wasn't worth discussing. But I don't like that viewpoint, because i like discussions, and i don't take them or make them personal
2016-02-02 17:49:18	@indeedwatson	Porkepikk: it was in the title?
2016-02-02 17:49:43	Porkepikk	Well, yeah, do you know the post ?
2016-02-02 17:49:45	@indeedwatson	was anyone else spoiled TFA by r/4chan?
2016-02-02 17:50:00	Porkepikk	I don't wanna spoil others and link it
2016-02-02 17:50:03	RyanSmallwood	nope
2016-02-02 17:50:14	@indeedwatson	Porkepikk: no but i've seen cache, I didn't understand if the spoilers were in the title or in the comments
2016-02-02 17:50:28	Porkepikk	It was a post about a kind of ending
2016-02-02 17:50:57	@indeedwatson	if it was in the title i understand your rage totally
2016-02-02 17:50:57	Porkepikk	Then the guy say in the post something like "what do you think about movies with that kind of ending like Caché ?"
2016-02-02 17:51:11	Porkepikk	Then I cried on the discord channel I'm in
2016-02-02 17:51:14	Porkepikk	BibleThump
2016-02-02 17:51:28	@indeedwatson	well that's kind of shady, cause the topic is about endings
2016-02-02 17:51:42	@indeedwatson	it's like those askreddits "what's the movie with the most fucked up ending"
2016-02-02 17:51:47	Porkepikk	Well, wasn't expecting an example
2016-02-02 17:51:50	Porkepikk	It's not needed
2016-02-02 17:51:52	Porkepikk	To me
2016-02-02 17:51:55	@indeedwatson	and there you can't list a movie without minor spoilers
2016-02-02 17:52:04	@indeedwatson	*implied spoilers
2016-02-02 17:52:17	Porkepikk	Except it didn't have a spoiler tag
2016-02-02 17:52:46	Porkepikk	The guy also explain the fucking end btw
2016-02-02 17:52:53	Porkepikk	So I literally know how it finish
2016-02-02 17:52:54	@indeedwatson	but if he wanted to discuss the ending of cache in that context, there is no way not to mention cache
2016-02-02 17:53:11	@indeedwatson	because if you say "spoilers for cache" then you're already spoiling by mentioning it
2016-02-02 17:53:48	Porkepikk	Whatever, not reading TrueFilm subreddit anymore, I just want to watch movies so Ryan can listen to the stupid things I have to say and respond ":D :D :D"
2016-02-02 17:54:01	RyanSmallwood	:D :D :D
2016-02-02 17:54:27	@indeedwatson	lol
2016-02-02 17:54:39	@indeedwatson	i really enjoyed the post on interstellar by a11er
2016-02-02 17:54:45	@indeedwatson	not sure if it was in tf or in flicks
2016-02-02 18:17:10	RyanSmallwood	indeedwatson: I think this is where it gets tricky with race and gender, because if you face a lot of discrimination you're put in the awkward position of it being a very important issue to you, but also not wanting to have to give everyone a race and gender 101 course. If you find a patient person and are polite they may go into a long discussion
2016-02-02 18:17:10	RyanSmallwood	with you, but sometimes with these topics if you want to have discussions  its helpful to show you've done some basic reading in them so they don't have to take you through all  the basic steps
2016-02-02 18:20:14	@indeedwatson	i think that's fair if the movie is clearly about race or gender, but if you're debating whether it is or not, you should use the film itself and its elements to make your points
2016-02-02 18:20:55	@indeedwatson	failing to do that and appealing to social causes or tendencies sounds condescending and like you have an agenda
2016-02-02 18:22:37	@indeedwatson	i think it can be more clear if we use a less touchy subject
2016-02-02 18:23:38	@indeedwatson	if i said Whipslash is about music and you say it's more about struggle, personal obstacles, mentor-disciple relantionship, I can't just you down with "well i'm a musician, you wouldn't understand", that's just silly
2016-02-02 18:23:52	@indeedwatson	*just shut you down
2016-02-02 18:25:45	@indeedwatson	and neither should I need to explain music, or to expect you to know about it much in order to discuss the movie
2016-02-02 18:26:03	@indeedwatson	or assume that you don't know about music because you disagree with the movie being about music
2016-02-02 18:26:28	Porkepik	I must admit
2016-02-02 18:26:30	Porkepik	But
2016-02-02 18:26:31	Porkepik	I'm lost
2016-02-02 18:26:45	Porkepik	I gave up on understanding ... :[
2016-02-02 18:26:56	RyanSmallwood	Its hard to compare it to other topics, becuase race and gender are everywhere and they're also issues people face every day
2016-02-02 18:26:58	@indeedwatson	well of course you can make the point that the reason that example would be silly and the other isn't, is because race IS a touchy subject
2016-02-02 18:27:02	RyanSmallwood	just for a hypothetical
2016-02-02 18:27:02	@indeedwatson	heh
2016-02-02 18:27:18	RyanSmallwood	lets assume we live in a society where there's discrimination against blue eyed people
2016-02-02 18:27:23	RyanSmallwood	nothing too overt like slavery
2016-02-02 18:27:30	RyanSmallwood	but blue eyed people are paid less
2016-02-02 18:27:41	RyanSmallwood	and there's lots of blue eyed people stereotypes in movies
2016-02-02 18:28:00	RyanSmallwood	and sometimes its fuzzy and hard to talk about clearly, but as a blue-eyed person you notice it all the time
2016-02-02 18:28:20	RyanSmallwood	so one blue-eyed person reads some books about blue-eyed discrimination and decides its bullshit and they won't stand for it anymore
2016-02-02 18:28:48	RyanSmallwood	so whenever they hear someone making a blue-eyed joke, or stereotyped blue-eye characters in movies, they mention it
2016-02-02 18:29:03	RyanSmallwood	and whenever they mention it they instantly get tons of challenges
2016-02-02 18:29:22	RyanSmallwood	"what that movie totally wasn't about blue-eyed people, I didn't notice anything."
2016-02-02 18:29:40	RyanSmallwood	and when the blue-eyed person tries to explain they get asked a thousand quesitons by everyone they tried to talk to about it
2016-02-02 18:29:58	RyanSmallwood	and they really just want people to know to knock it off with the blue-eyed jokes and acknlowedge that its an issue in movies
2016-02-02 18:30:36	RyanSmallwood	but the people who joke about it and don't notice it also expect the blue-eyed person to give an elaborate explanation of whats very obvious to them
2016-02-02 18:30:53	RyanSmallwood	so all the blue-eyed person wants is for everyone else to just notice and consider how blue eyed people are portayed in movies in talk about
2016-02-02 18:31:00	RyanSmallwood	they're not asking for the moon just to reflect on it
2016-02-02 18:31:13	RyanSmallwood	but they're tired and exhausted by the barrage of questions they get when they bring it up
2016-02-02 18:31:23	@indeedwatson	well you're making the assumption that the other people don't notice it, rather than maybe some notice it and disagree
2016-02-02 18:31:55	@indeedwatson	and maybe they've noticed that most of the movies with lazy blue eyed people jokes also have poorly written brown eyed characters, and the issue is mostly lazy writing
2016-02-02 18:32:55	@indeedwatson	or simply that the movie is depicting a historical time, somewhat accurately, while not really making a comment about it

2016-02-02 18:34:07	RyanSmallwood	I think the tone behind the discussion matters a lot
2016-02-02 18:34:28	RyanSmallwood	I think you can be supportive of the overall goal but disagree on the specifics
2016-02-02 18:35:01	RyanSmallwood	a lot of times when people discuss discrimination they get challenged on their whole premise, which can be exhausting if that's part of their everyday experience and self-evident to them
2016-02-02 18:35:15	@indeedwatson	but that is tiring
2016-02-02 18:35:21	@indeedwatson	i just want to discuss movies
2016-02-02 18:35:30	@indeedwatson	like i said, i put my personal issues aside
2016-02-02 18:35:40	RyanSmallwood	well I think that's a valid response to have
2016-02-02 18:35:52	RyanSmallwood	but I think a better way to go about it
2016-02-02 18:35:54	@indeedwatson	and i expect other people to do the same, unless they're insulted personally
2016-02-02 18:36:05	RyanSmallwood	is when someone wants to talk about race or gender
2016-02-02 18:36:12	@indeedwatson	SPECIALLY on the internet
2016-02-02 18:36:14	RyanSmallwood	just allow them to make your point and don't comment on it
2016-02-02 18:36:22	RyanSmallwood	*to make their point
2016-02-02 18:36:31	@indeedwatson	well that's close to self censorship, and i don't agree with it on principle
2016-02-02 18:36:44	RyanSmallwood	:/
2016-02-02 18:37:20	RyanSmallwood	isn't there a way to express that without denying their point?
2016-02-02 18:37:22	Porkepik	But, aren't you censoring them too if you except them to shut up ?
2016-02-02 18:37:33	@indeedwatson	i didn't expect them to shut up
2016-02-02 18:37:34	@indeedwatson	at all
2016-02-02 18:37:39	@indeedwatson	quite the contrary
2016-02-02 18:37:54	@indeedwatson	I was about to log out and back in with my non-op nick
2016-02-02 18:38:14	Porkepik	Also, what is making racism such a different subject that let say, fatherhood, as you talked about ?
2016-02-02 18:38:54	@indeedwatson	Porkepik: that is one of my biggest questions that i ponder often
2016-02-02 18:39:23	@indeedwatson	to me it's just that some topics are more in the air, so they find an echo chamber more easily
2016-02-02 18:41:04	@indeedwatson	and speaking of trends, like RyanSmallwood mentioned, i've noticed that people that tend to be on the sensitive side about some issues are more quick to try to shut it down rather than explore it
2016-02-02 18:41:10	@indeedwatson	but that's just my personal experience with a few people
2016-02-02 18:41:49	RyanSmallwood	can you see it from their side though?
2016-02-02 18:41:55	RyanSmallwood	like you have this conversation occasionally
2016-02-02 18:42:05	RyanSmallwood	but some people have this conversation constantly
2016-02-02 18:42:16	RyanSmallwood	and for them it can be exhausting
2016-02-02 18:42:56	RyanSmallwood	and they don't want to have to teach everyone basics
2016-02-02 18:43:09	@indeedwatson	im sorry but that is extremely condescending
2016-02-02 18:43:24	@indeedwatson	"if you disagree with me it's because i have to teach you the basics"
2016-02-02 18:43:51	@indeedwatson	it goes back to the Whiplash example
2016-02-02 18:45:24	@indeedwatson	and from the start assumes that you know more than the other person
2016-02-02 18:45:35	@indeedwatson	which goes against what you said earlier about hearing the other side
2016-02-02 18:46:23	@indeedwatson	and it's worth pointing out that I assumed I knew more about The Revenant because I didn't fall asleep :p
2016-02-02 18:47:02	Porkepik	I'm so lost :[
2016-02-02 18:47:09	Porkepik	I'm gonna watch Cary Grant running away from a plane

2016-02-02 18:47:53	@indeedwatson	chasing him to the end of the world
2016-02-02 18:47:57	Porkepik	:'( I just want to look at the moving pictures
2016-02-02 18:50:19	Porkepik	"Cinema is incredible. We see girls in dresses. Cinema comes and we see their ass" Porkepik (Yeah, no, I didn't steal it I swear !)
2016-02-02 18:50:34	RyanSmallwood	:P
2016-02-02 18:50:54	@indeedwatson	butts are the best
2016-02-02 18:59:24	RyanSmallwood	I dunno your personal experiences, or views, or what you've read so I can't say anything
2016-02-02 19:00:11	RyanSmallwood	I would just say if someone brings up some form of discrimination that you don't personally experience, unless you've read a lot of intelligent perspectives from people who do experience it, its better to try and listen and understand than throw out for the first counter argument that springs to mind
2016-02-02 19:02:12	@indeedwatson	if it is the topic, yes
2016-02-02 19:02:26	@indeedwatson	if the topic is a movie, then you should be able to formulate arguments talking about the movie
2016-02-02 19:05:47	@indeedwatson	because lets assume both people have the same exact background and knowledge about discrimination
2016-02-02 19:05:55	@indeedwatson	they will still have to actually discuss the movie...
2016-02-02 19:06:35	@indeedwatson	so why not do that in the first place
2016-02-02 19:12:30	RyanSmallwood	so I guess just to get back to the previous conversation
2016-02-02 19:13:02	RyanSmallwood	I think most of the conversation with scarlett was just fine
2016-02-02 19:13:05	RyanSmallwood	but at a certain point
2016-02-02 19:13:18	RyanSmallwood	there were too many assumptions being made about both viewpoints
2016-02-02 19:13:48	@indeedwatson	i think they got offended when i said they didn't watch the whole movie
2016-02-02 19:13:57	Mothravka	You seemed to get along very well. Like soulmates.
2016-02-02 19:14:12	@indeedwatson	hahah
2016-02-02 19:14:13	RyanSmallwood	yeah I think that's the problem
2016-02-02 19:14:45	RyanSmallwood	even thought scarlett did sleep through the movie I think he or she did see enough to feel like they could talk about the racial aspect because it did play a part in whatever they were awake for
2016-02-02 19:15:00	@indeedwatson	yeah i tend to be very sarcastic
2016-02-02 19:15:07	RyanSmallwood	so when you said that they couldn't speak about the theme if they fell asleep, they just decided to quit the conversation
2016-02-02 19:15:30	@indeedwatson	well that's what I thought, it made sense if they saw until a certain point, and didn't see the issue gets mostly dropped completely through the rest of the film
2016-02-02 19:16:08	RyanSmallwood	so probably you didn't know scarlett was going to leave
2016-02-02 19:16:29	RyanSmallwood	but perhaps if you said something like "I think race was much less important in the second half of the film"
2016-02-02 19:16:36	RyanSmallwood	maybe scarlett would've said, oh I slept through that part
2016-02-02 19:16:40	RyanSmallwood	and it would've been less of a big deal
2016-02-02 19:16:41	RyanSmallwood	I dunno
2016-02-02 19:17:20	@indeedwatson	yeah that's pretty easy to say after the fact
2016-02-02 19:17:26	@indeedwatson	but i did include a smiley!
2016-02-02 19:19:38	RyanSmallwood	heh yeah
2016-02-02 19:19:51	RyanSmallwood	those situations are tricky to read sometime
2016-02-02 19:19:55	RyanSmallwood	thanks for discussing

2016-02-02 20:01:42	RyanSmallwood	I saw you gave 3 stars to Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?
2016-02-02 20:01:47	RyanSmallwood	I saw that recently too
2016-02-02 20:02:00	Mothravka	Yeah, charming stuff.
2016-02-02 20:02:38	Mothravka	I've seen a bit over 200 Swedish films, but I feel that I've only scraped the surface. Missed a lot of important stuff, so I'll try to keep up a bit.
2016-02-02 20:04:13	thewillmatic___	indeedwatson: nothing much. finished Mesrine Part 1 today. and i went on a walk earlier and found a 7 inch switchblade, which was awesome.
2016-02-02 20:04:31	@indeedwatson	aw damn
2016-02-02 20:04:33	Card	I'm a bit surprised by the low amount
2016-02-02 20:04:35	@indeedwatson	not rusty or anything?
2016-02-02 20:05:14	thewillmatic___	nah. works great. looks like this http://static.knifecenter.com/resize/timthumb.php?src=http://static.knifecenter.com/graphics/cover/101.jpg&w=960&q=70

2016-02-02 20:05:56	thewillmatic___	longer blade though. that little “horn” at the end of the sharp side sticks out when you collapse it. then just tap that horn and it springs out
2016-02-02 20:06:09	@indeedwatson	that looks awesome, even tho i'd probably get no use out of it
2016-02-02 20:06:33	thewillmatic___	yeah, same. gonna sharpen and keep it though

2016-02-05 20:17:52	Guest80007	Ok so first, it is not banned
2016-02-05 20:18:10	Guest80007	It kinda is, it can't be broadcast on TV or a cinema cause it's pending a new classification
2016-02-05 20:18:25	Guest80007	Also, it's likely they will give it a -18 and move on
2016-02-05 20:19:03	@indeedwatson	haha i was gonna ping you but i forgot about your nick
2016-02-05 20:19:55	Guest80007	Also, it's a stupid thing to except every country in Europe to have move on from "movie censorship"
2016-02-05 20:20:25	Guest80007	Especially when you take the case of a nordic country who doesn't deal with the same amount of issues
2016-02-05 20:21:15	@indeedwatson	what issues do you mean?
2016-02-05 20:21:45	Guest80007	Finland is doing better in term of economic
2016-02-05 20:22:08	@indeedwatson	what's that gotta do with banning movies tho
2016-02-05 20:22:12	Guest80007	People won't give too much shit about what is happening to Antichrist, and it's already quite controversial
2016-02-05 20:22:37	Guest80007	What i'm saying is, it's easy for those kind of things to happen when people don't focus on the issue
2016-02-05 20:22:59	Guest80007	Right now, over censorship of movies is (maybe for bad reasons) not the focus on the average person in France
2016-02-05 20:24:00	Guest80007	Also, in a way, they have a reason to "ban" it
2016-02-05 20:24:18	Guest80007	From what I know of Antichrist, it fits what a -18 should be in France
2016-02-05 20:24:30	Guest80007	And while a religion group pointed at the issue, anybody could have done it
2016-02-05 20:24:50	@indeedwatson	well we're also shit economically and i don't think there's banned movies here
2016-02-05 20:24:58	Card	sure, it's brutal, although not excessively (like Cannibal Holocaust brutal).
2016-02-05 20:25:01	Guest80007	It's just they must only have that kind of shit to do to keep themselves busy
2016-02-05 20:25:51	Guest80007	I just don't like when people can easily say things like "Finland has progressed from the days of movie censorship..." like France is still in the stone ages and we're so fucking prude and scared of transgressive films
2016-02-05 20:27:22	Guest80007	WHEN the only fucking thing that happened is : Relgion group noticed a movie was "under" censored cause it should be -18 instead of -16, they need to change the classification and during the process, they "ban" it from broadcast
2016-02-05 20:27:41	Card	Is there a cinephile lobby against these religious freaks?
2016-02-05 20:27:50	Guest80007	"religion freak" ...
2016-02-05 20:28:05	Card	We had one during the 80s dark ages
2016-02-05 20:28:08	Guest80007	They just noticed it, it could have been anybody else, they didn't ban it for religion purposes
2016-02-05 20:29:15	Guest80007	The only thing that needs to be fixed is the law
2016-02-05 20:29:33	@indeedwatson	16 to 18 seems kinda silly tho
2016-02-05 20:29:38	Guest80007	If they remove the -18 rating (cause it's pretty useless to me), this issue wouldn't exist
2016-02-05 20:29:56	Card	huh?
2016-02-05 20:30:28	@indeedwatson	he's saying the max rating should be 16+ i think
2016-02-05 20:31:15	Guest80007	Yeah, like that, it would already have been "censored" as much as possible
2016-02-05 20:31:37	Guest80007	Since -18 exists, they have a right to complain for a movie to get this rating
2016-02-05 20:31:44	Card	So... you don't cut your movies there at all?
2016-02-05 20:31:59	Guest80007	"cut" What do you mean ?
2016-02-05 20:32:14	Guest80007	Antichrist is not cut, just ban from broadcasting while they are changing the classification
2016-02-05 20:32:27	Guest80007	http://www.amazon.fr/Antichrist-Willem-Dafoe/dp/B003BGAT1K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1454715141&sr=8-1&keywords=antichrist

2016-02-05 20:32:29	Guest80007	Look
2016-02-05 20:32:32	Card	Cut the sex / violent / whatever scenes away for lower rating. It's done in many places, UK included.
2016-02-05 20:32:34	Guest80007	You can even buy the DVD
2016-02-05 20:33:08	Card	(although they've moved away from the practice during these last ~20 years)
2016-02-05 20:33:15	Guest80007	Well, not really
2016-02-05 20:33:23	Guest80007	I don't remember a case where a movie was cut
2016-02-05 20:36:12	Guest80007	In France, movies with non simulated sex scenes are -18, doesn't Antichrist has those ?
2016-02-05 20:36:17	Guest80007	That could be the reason
2016-02-05 20:37:28	Card	not really, the gory bits are rather disturbing
2016-02-05 20:38:41	Guest80007	Anyway, I went too far and off topic, but even a minister in France supported Love getting a -16 but it didn't work
2016-02-05 20:39:15	Guest80007	The law need to be changed, and in this matter, people prefer to focus on "important" issues, at least, what they think to be important
2016-02-05 20:40:10	Guest80007	So it's, indeed, quite sad to see Antichrist maybe, maybe not, getting over-censored but there is no need to fall into quick judgements
2016-02-05 20:42:07	Guest80007	So I'm gonna leave this place definitly, cause while I'm not that smart, and said some stupid shits myself, I don't see what this place has to offer except useless discussions and unfair anger over strangers I really don't care that much

2016-02-09 22:57:16	Microshrimp	I just rewatched A Single Man.  that's a pretty good movie
2016-02-09 22:58:11	@indeedwatson	oh I think that's on my watchlist
2016-02-09 22:58:22	@indeedwatson	for a second I confused it with A Serious Man
2016-02-09 22:58:38	Microshrimp	haha yeah-- and they were both out the same year I think and i was getting them confused all year
2016-02-09 22:58:42	Microshrimp	I haven't seen A Serious Man
2016-02-09 22:58:57	@indeedwatson	I did but only once

2016-02-09 23:02:59	Microshrimp	I was going to watch "The Dreamers" which I just got from Amazon.  I opened it and the damn disc was cracked. :(  I'm going to send it back and have to buy it again.  I don't remember a whole lot about the movie, but I saw it on TV a few years ago
2016-02-09 23:03:15	Microshrimp	I don't think I've ever had that happen
2016-02-09 23:04:22	@indeedwatson	damn
2016-02-09 23:04:39	@indeedwatson	buy it again? don't they have to resend it for free?
2016-02-09 23:05:10	Microshrimp	That's a good question.  The only option it gave me was a return.  I didn't see an option to trade
2016-02-09 23:05:15	Microshrimp	I have Prime so I get free shipping anyway
2016-02-09 23:05:30	Microshrimp	"free" -- I mean, I pay for Prime, so I don't pay additional for shipping.
2016-02-09 23:06:22	@indeedwatson	i assumed if you get a broken product amazon would change it
2016-02-09 23:06:30	@indeedwatson	but i never bought anything on amazon
2016-02-09 23:07:54	Microshrimp	I was just followed the directions on the webpage.  Maybe if I had tried to e-mail or call the process would be different.
2016-02-09 23:20:26	Microshrimp	Have you ever seen "This Is England"?  that's another one I like

2016-02-11 01:05:12	Microshrimp	Wolf of Wall Street has a really high IMDB rating.  Is it a good movie?
2016-02-11 01:05:39	@indeedwatson	I liked it
2016-02-11 01:05:46	Microshrimp	I can watch it for no charge on Amazon Prime.  I might do that tonight
2016-02-11 01:05:49	@indeedwatson	should rewatch it
2016-02-11 01:05:56	@indeedwatson	it's like 3 hours long tho
2016-02-11 01:06:05	Microshrimp	oh wow, you're right
2016-02-11 01:06:52	@indeedwatson	it took me a bit to figure it out until i started watching it as a comedy
2016-02-11 01:06:55	Microshrimp	I'm looking for good movies to watch on Prime
2016-02-11 01:07:25	@indeedwatson	do you have a list?
2016-02-11 01:07:34	Microshrimp	not yet--
2016-02-11 01:07:46	Microshrimp	kinda just started looking right now
2016-02-11 01:10:14	Microshrimp	oh, and willmatic in here last night recommened Starred Up, which is also on Amazon Prime. Maybe I'll do that instead
2016-02-11 01:10:43	@indeedwatson	I'm not familiar with it
2016-02-11 01:11:52	Microshrimp	I was talking about a movie called "This Is England" and willmatic said the description reminded him of Starred Up.  Turns out there's at least one actor that is in both films. lol
2016-02-11 01:12:32	Microshrimp	I think you here right when I started that conversation
2016-02-11 01:13:29	@indeedwatson	yes i remember your mention of that movie
2016-02-11 01:14:13	@indeedwatson	do you like british films in particular?
2016-02-11 01:15:12	Microshrimp	I'm not sure if I've seen enough to say I do in particular, but I'm happy enough with what I've seen to be interested in seeing more
2016-02-11 01:15:32	Microshrimp	I'd like to see more French films.  Seems like there are some really great French films out there
2016-02-11 01:15:46	Microshrimp	why is that?  Just a coincidence that I've run across them?
2016-02-11 01:16:27	@indeedwatson	which ones beside Blue is the Warmest Color
2016-02-11 01:16:35	Microshrimp	Swimming Pool
2016-02-11 01:17:13	Microshrimp	Paris, je t'aime is a fun collection of short films that are set in France and I'm assuming most of them are French
2016-02-11 01:18:04	Microshrimp	The Dreamers
2016-02-11 01:18:08	Microshrimp	I think that was French
2016-02-11 01:18:46	Microshrimp	This was a fun little film I saw on IFC or something one time:  la moustache  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0428856
2016-02-11 01:18:47		[ http://is.gd/wyLitC ]
2016-02-11 01:19:29	Microshrimp	I'm trying to think if there are more.  I used to watch stuff on IFC/Sundance all the time, but I was bad at writing things down
2016-02-11 01:19:40	@indeedwatson	i don't know any of those heh, I thought you meant older like Godard
2016-02-11 01:19:54	Microshrimp	Amelie
2016-02-11 01:20:41	@indeedwatson	have you seen delicatessen?
2016-02-11 01:22:17	Microshrimp	not yet-- but wow-- it's on Amazon Prime.  I could watch that soon too
2016-02-11 01:23:28	@indeedwatson	how about Amour
2016-02-11 01:23:35	@indeedwatson	idk if that counts as french but it is in french
2016-02-11 01:24:57	Microshrimp	that actually looks really familiar, but if it came out in 2012, then I haven't seen it.  I would probably remember it better if I had
2016-02-11 01:25:21	@indeedwatson	it's very good
2016-02-11 01:25:22	Microshrimp	wow, it has a really high rating on IMDB
2016-02-11 01:25:26	@indeedwatson	yes
2016-02-11 01:25:32	@indeedwatson	it's Haneke :D
2016-02-11 01:25:58	Microshrimp	I need to start paying more attention to names.
2016-02-11 01:27:02	@indeedwatson	it happens organically when you realize you like a director in particular and then another and you start seeing themes in common across their movies
2016-02-11 01:27:04	Microshrimp	oh, someone in here recently said I should check my library for movies-- I don't know if they have any streaming available, but I did check and they have a ton of DVDs to check out
2016-02-11 01:27:17	Microshrimp	I do really love Wes Anderson
2016-02-11 01:27:28	Microshrimp	I know he has a big following, but I just really love the movies and style
2016-02-11 01:27:36	Microshrimp	and the casting
2016-02-11 01:27:40	@indeedwatson	oh yeah i remember you mentioned that
2016-02-11 01:27:45	@indeedwatson	i think I saw all of his movies
2016-02-11 01:28:09	Microshrimp	I really move Moonrise Kingdom.  I think I can really relate to the characters
2016-02-11 01:28:13	Microshrimp	*really love
2016-02-11 01:28:54	@indeedwatson	yeah that was a good one
2016-02-11 01:28:57	@indeedwatson	saw it like 3 times
2016-02-11 01:28:58	Microshrimp	and if I can't decide what movie to watch, I'll often grab Darjeeling Limited and play that
2016-02-11 01:29:20	Microshrimp	(I'm drinking Darjeeling tea right now. lol)
2016-02-11 01:29:37	@indeedwatson	haha
2016-02-11 01:29:42	@indeedwatson	i saw that one only once
2016-02-11 01:30:57	@indeedwatson	have you seen Submarine?
2016-02-11 01:31:56	Microshrimp	No, but the description sounds really good
2016-02-11 01:32:23	@indeedwatson	it's by Richard Ayoade, the style is pretty similar to Wes Anderson in a way
2016-02-11 01:32:27	@indeedwatson	felt a lot like Rushmore
2016-02-11 01:32:43	Microshrimp	lol on IMDB, in the "People who liked this also liked..." I have seen most of those and really like them
2016-02-11 01:32:53	Microshrimp	Oh excellent!
2016-02-11 01:33:11	@indeedwatson	he made another movie called The Double which i haven't seen yet
2016-02-11 01:54:19	Microshrimp	wow, I might be awake for a while... lots of caffeine
2016-02-11 01:55:52	@indeedwatson	what time is it there?
2016-02-11 01:55:58	@indeedwatson	did you decide on a movie?
2016-02-11 01:55:59	Microshrimp	almost midnight
2016-02-11 01:56:00	Microshrimp	haha
2016-02-11 01:56:07	Microshrimp	nah, I'm still looking up stuff. haha
2016-02-11 01:56:51	@indeedwatson	it's almost 2 am here
2016-02-11 01:57:33	Microshrimp	wanted to get through this tea as well.  Just got a big box of random teas of various quality from another tea buddy and he wanted me to pick something and guess if it was one of the good ones or one of the bad ones.  Of course the one I picked at random ended up being one of his favorites, so I guess it's all down hill from here. haha
2016-02-11 01:57:46	Microshrimp	I'm just doing the one tea tonight tonight though
2016-02-11 01:58:54	@indeedwatson	i haven't had a good tea in a while
2016-02-11 01:59:29	Microshrimp	well, if ever want to know more about tea, I'm the guy to ask. haha
2016-02-11 02:00:12	Microshrimp	and I know absolutely nothing about coffee :)
2016-02-11 02:02:42	Microshrimp	You know, I don't know if there's any tea from Argentina.  I've never heard of any, have you?
2016-02-11 02:03:10	@indeedwatson	i mean im sure there's tea from here, but i don't know if there's anything particular about it
2016-02-11 02:03:19	@indeedwatson	i've had some very good tea from Taiwan
2016-02-11 02:03:34	Microshrimp	ooh yeah, Taiwan has some of the best teas in the world
2016-02-11 02:03:43	Microshrimp	Taiwan, China, and India are the top three probably
2016-02-11 02:03:57	Microshrimp	and Japan is known for green tea
2016-02-11 02:04:35	@indeedwatson	i have a taiwanese friend and they did like a whole ceremony of serving it
2016-02-11 02:04:46	Microshrimp	Ahh very nice
2016-02-11 02:05:02	Microshrimp	I'd say it was probably an oolong
2016-02-11 02:05:37	@indeedwatson	that is a funny word
2016-02-11 02:05:43	@indeedwatson	it could be
2016-02-11 02:05:54	Microshrimp	I have everything that would be needed for a ceremony, but if I'm just drinking on my own I don't get too caught up in all those extra steps
2016-02-11 02:06:10	Microshrimp	lol there are a lot of funny tea words
2016-02-11 02:06:19	Microshrimp	One famous oolong from Taiwan is called Dong Ding
2016-02-11 02:06:19	@indeedwatson	at the time i used to just drink black twa with three sugars, but i had that one without sugar and i liked it
2016-02-11 02:06:28	@indeedwatson	hahah
2016-02-11 02:07:11	Microshrimp	I've got a black tea from China called Bang Dong Hong
2016-02-11 02:09:18	@indeedwatson	i love it
2016-02-11 02:11:41	Microshrimp	Those names are traditional, but, there's a guy in China (he's from the US) who produces and sells a type of tea called Puerh.  He's one of the top two puerh vendors for the Western market.  He comes up with all kinds of crazy names for his teas.  A lot of them are references to pop culture and such
2016-02-11 02:12:57	Microshrimp	Like one is called "If You're Reading This It's 2 Late" which is also the name of a Drake album
2016-02-11 02:17:52	@indeedwatson	that's the name of the tea? or that translate to chinese?
2016-02-11 02:19:19	Microshrimp	that
2016-02-11 02:19:28	Microshrimp	that's just what he decided to call it. haha http://www.white2tea.com/tea-shop/2015-if-youre-reading-this-its-2-late/

2016-02-11 14:23:29	sixteenmiles	Hello
2016-02-11 14:30:19	sixteenmiles	I wanted to ask some truefilmers a weird question. I've been using a site called icheckmovies.com to keep track of films I've been watching. I noticed that /r/truefilm kind of endorses a service called letterboxd. It looks much better but the idea of transferring thousands of film ratings across is daunting. Has anyone used both services and could

2016-02-11 14:31:46	@indeedwatson	sixteenmiles: i use letterboxd precisely cause everyone else uses it
2016-02-11 14:32:11	@indeedwatson	and I don't really care about the lists and the tracking itself that much, if I did I would use a spreadsheet like tomflint that doesn't depend on a 3rd party service
2016-02-11 14:32:27	@indeedwatson	there's a few users who use icheckmovies here but they haven't been around much lately
2016-02-11 14:32:51	@indeedwatson	so it depends if you want slick design, social, or more lists features and options
2016-02-11 14:32:57	@indeedwatson	or both, if you have the time
2016-02-11 14:37:21	sixteenmiles	Cheers
2016-02-11 14:37:50	sixteenmiles	I feel like icheckmovies is on the verge of being abandoned by the developers so it might be a good opportunity to jump ship.
2016-02-11 14:38:00	zxc	there might be a way to export your list from that site
2016-02-11 14:41:36	sixteenmiles	There is an export option, but I think it's a pro feature which I never shelled out for.
2016-02-11 14:42:00	sixteenmiles	It's no problem though. I don't mind spending a weekend transferring all the ratings.

2016-02-11 15:00:27	@indeedwatson	but i saw mind game multiple times, sober and stoned
2016-02-11 15:00:47	@indeedwatson	and paprika, i didn't like it so much, I think i need to rewatch it and give it another chance
2016-02-11 15:00:54	sixteenmiles	Maybe they were just rated near to each other
2016-02-11 15:01:03	@indeedwatson	yeah probably
2016-02-11 15:01:24	sixteenmiles	Yeah I don't think many people could say that they liked Paprika on first viewing
2016-02-11 15:01:58	@indeedwatson	i like Satoshi Kon so I was expecting to like it, but there was something about the character development and how it ended that rubbed me the wrong way
2016-02-11 15:02:24	sixteenmiles	It's confusing to the point of being distracting and there's so much happening in the background.

2016-02-11 19:24:06	tomflint	if any of you want to copy my spreadsheet, I can help you with that
2016-02-11 19:26:04	tomflint	I can also walk you through pulling your lists out with some simple hacks
2016-02-11 19:31:12	sixteenmiles	tomflint, can you show an example of your spreadsheet? Haven't seen it, so don't know...

2016-02-11 19:31:29		[ http://is.gd/c5d7dK ]
2016-02-11 19:31:43	tomflint	I have a second sheet that pulls all of the information with an API
2016-02-11 19:32:03	tomflint	you can either use the IMDB ID or the title and (optionally) year
2016-02-11 19:32:26	sixteenmiles	Out of curiosity why do you choose to use this method over something like Letterboxd or icheckmovies?
2016-02-11 19:33:38	tomflint	purely because those sites either a) don't offer good importing / exporting, b) are too social, cluttered, slow, c) rely on ads, which I block
2016-02-11 19:34:38	sixteenmiles	There are a few things I can think of that this might be better for.
2016-02-11 19:35:09	sixteenmiles	Creating quick text lists. And also, a weird one... I sometimes want to just get a random film from my watch list without having to think too much about it. Would be much easier to pull that from a spreadsheet.
2016-02-11 19:35:40	sixteenmiles	But I imagine it has more maintenance required.
2016-02-11 19:36:05	tomflint	nah, very little maintenance -- and once you get used to the process, its a breeze
2016-02-11 19:36:30	f91w	tomflint: awesome stuff, do you have both available as templates?
2016-02-11 19:36:38	tomflint	the other nice thing is that I have generated links to trailers, imdb, and a search on a usenet indexer
2016-02-11 19:36:59	tomflint	f91w: I can build one for you if you want it
2016-02-11 19:37:40	tomflint	it won't take more than a few minutes -- then I'll give you a run through of how to easily scrape sites
2016-02-11 19:37:49	f91w	please do
2016-02-11 19:38:58	sixteenmiles	What's the percentage in the middle column?
2016-02-11 19:39:01	sixteenmiles	Your rating?
2016-02-11 19:39:23	tomflint	its a combination of IMDB, Metacritic, Rotten Tomatoes (Critics), and Rotten Tomatoes (users)
2016-02-11 19:39:43	tomflint	do you guys use any downloading sites?
2016-02-11 19:40:47	f91w	Like kat.ph, thepiratebay, etc?
2016-02-11 19:40:54	tomflint	yeah
2016-02-11 19:40:58	f91w	yeah, both of those
2016-02-11 19:41:02	sixteenmiles	No. I had a friend got hit for piracy and it shook me up some. I haven't since.
2016-02-11 19:41:13	tomflint	I'll help you fix the link so it works with those sites
2016-02-11 19:41:17	f91w	sixteenmiles: Seedbox!
2016-02-11 19:41:23	willmatic_	just use a VPN sixteenmiles
2016-02-11 19:41:31	willmatic_	or seedbox
2016-02-11 19:42:03	f91w	tomflint: So are you doing some stuff with the URLs or are you access APIs?
2016-02-11 19:42:07	@indeedwatson	sixteenmiles: are you from the US?
2016-02-11 19:42:11	sixteenmiles	UK
2016-02-11 19:42:36	tomflint	both -- it uses an API to pull the information, and then I use a formula to build the download link
2016-02-11 19:42:39	@indeedwatson	ah, when someone gets a piracy warning i assume US
2016-02-11 19:42:56	f91w	tomflint: Are you access a single API? What is it?
2016-02-11 19:43:07	sixteenmiles	A few years ago the UK went big on it. A lot of piracy sites are actually blocked at ISP level these days.
2016-02-11 19:43:07	tomflint	it runs through OMDB
2016-02-11 19:43:32	tomflint	its a little hacky -- mainly, input your information, close the sheet, make a copy, then open it and give it a minute.
2016-02-11 19:43:33	f91w	sixteenmiles: How technical are you? Do you think you could use a VPN daily?
2016-02-11 19:43:37	tomflint	I'll write it all up though
2016-02-11 19:43:51	sixteenmiles	I could, but I don't want to pay for one is all.
2016-02-11 19:43:57	willmatic_	sixteenmiles, using a VPN is really easy. mine costs $40/year and i pirate multiple gigs every day
2016-02-11 19:44:10	willmatic_	and i have for years. never gotten a warning
2016-02-11 19:44:19	tomflint	you can get a VPN through one of the providers of lowendspirit for $3/year
2016-02-11 19:44:32	willmatic_	that too
2016-02-11 19:45:24	sixteenmiles	Fair enough. I'll look into it.
2016-02-11 19:46:37	sixteenmiles	I had a friend try and convince me to buy into usenet, but I just balk at subscriptions in general. I really don't have many sub services.
2016-02-11 19:49:24	f91w	tomflint: Woah, that's cheap. So I can install some OpenVZ compatible Linux guest and setup a VPN on it, and they wont complain about DMCA notices or otherwise (provided they're outside the US)?
2016-02-11 19:49:52	@indeedwatson	man im glad i don't have to worry about all that
2016-02-11 19:50:15	f91w	indeedwatson: Did you get my memo?
2016-02-11 19:50:23	tomflint	nah, if you're using it as a VPN it's fine. They aren't meant to be used as a seedbox or anything -- but they're great
2016-02-11 19:50:28	@indeedwatson	no, where?
2016-02-11 19:51:07	f91w	tomflint: Do you only say they aren't meant to be used as a seedbox because of their low storage capacity, or is there some service agreement reason?
2016-02-11 19:51:33	f91w	indeedwatson: memoserv, /msg memoserv read

2016-02-11 19:52:44	f91w	The director had some affair with Christianity early in life and that carried over into Angel's Egg and GitS to a lesser extent
2016-02-11 19:52:48	@indeedwatson	thanks :)
2016-02-11 19:53:13	@indeedwatson	do you know any similar anime?
2016-02-11 19:55:00	f91w	Unfortunately not off the top of my head. It is a somber, atmospheric/artsy 80s anime and the only other art-house animes are late 90s and newer psychedelic fast-paced ones like Paprika, Cat Soup, Mind Games etc
2016-02-11 19:55:11	f91w	The only other ones that I know of*

2016-02-11 20:20:48	tomflint	also, if you have duplicates, it'll mark the far column and highlight the ID in red --
2016-02-11 20:21:03	tomflint	you can filter off the duplicates and easily remove them
2016-02-11 20:21:17	tomflint	you can also sort by any column you wish without messing things up
2016-02-11 20:22:01	tomflint	for long form items like names and descriptions, I truncated them at x characters since IMDB sometimes has carriage returns -- which fucks up the sheet
2016-02-11 20:22:31	tomflint	as kat.cr changes URLs, update the URL in the variables tab and it'll update your links
2016-02-11 20:23:07	tomflint	the URL it builds is already set to only search the movies category too
2016-02-11 20:23:39	tomflint	and that's about it. Its fairly straightforward
2016-02-11 20:24:34	tomflint	I need to run to the butcher. When you make your copies, make two so you have a fresh backup. I'll be around later if you need any help scraping sites
2016-02-11 20:25:07	tomflint	i scraped icheckmovies with ease though -- and for most sites its as easy as doing a find and replace
2016-02-11 20:27:22	sixteenmiles	Redoing these ratings is just reminding me how many terrible terrible films I have seen.

2016-02-12 18:17:08	Microshrimp	weird
2016-02-12 18:19:39	Microshrimp	I watched Delicatessen last night!  It didn't take long for me to realize that it was the same director and some of the same actors as City of Lost Children-- a movie I have not seen in many years
2016-02-12 18:19:57	Microshrimp	I own City of Lost Children on VHS and I don't even think I have a VCR any more if that tells you how long it has been
2016-02-12 18:21:43	sixteenmiles	I love both of those films so much
2016-02-12 18:22:19	sixteenmiles	I think they really helped spark my interest in cinema, even if they are mostly forgotten to me now.
2016-02-12 18:28:37	Microshrimp	oh, I just now noticed that Delicatessen is the older of the two.  I didn't 'even realize that

2016-02-12 18:53:39	Microshrimp	yeah!
2016-02-12 18:54:30	sixteenmiles	And Alien 4!
2016-02-12 18:54:36	sixteenmiles	RIGHT GUYS!?
2016-02-12 18:54:53	@indeedwatson	hahah
2016-02-12 18:55:26	Microshrimp	hahha
2016-02-12 18:56:24	sixteenmiles	I think... and this is just speculation...
2016-02-12 18:56:41	Microshrimp	I don't think I ever saw that
2016-02-12 18:56:51	sixteenmiles	The earlier films are collaborations between two people, Jean Pierre-Jeunet and Marc Caro if I remember their names correctly.
2016-02-12 18:57:13	Microshrimp	Yes, that's what I'm seeing
2016-02-12 18:57:23	sixteenmiles	And this is just my opinion, but I think that the charm is really lost when they split and went solo.
2016-02-12 18:57:31	Microshrimp	Amelie definitely has a similar style, but doesn't feel as dark
2016-02-12 18:57:46	sixteenmiles	I don't know what Caro did later but Jeunet's stuff becomes more comedic and lighthearted.
2016-02-12 18:58:15	sixteenmiles	The last film I watched of his was Mic Macs and I just remember thinking "What happened?"
2016-02-12 18:58:16	Microshrimp	going by memory
2016-02-12 18:58:33	Microshrimp	Ahhh yea
2016-02-12 18:58:59	Microshrimp	I think Amelie is the last one I've seen
2016-02-12 18:59:03	Microshrimp	*most recent
2016-02-12 18:59:45	sixteenmiles	Well Amelie is great, and I did really enjoy the film he did after, A Very Long Engagement.
2016-02-12 19:00:00	sixteenmiles	But it was all a gradual downhill trend after he split with Caro imo.
2016-02-12 19:00:38	Microshrimp	ahh yes-- Very Long Engagement came up a couple times as I was looking for stuff I might like
2016-02-12 19:01:46	sixteenmiles	It's not bad.
2016-02-12 19:03:54	sixteenmiles	I think Caro must have brought much of the dirty sci-fi atmosphere, because that is mostly gone from any of the post-split films. And Jeunet I guess brought the character charm and quirkiness.
2016-02-12 19:04:18	sixteenmiles	It's just never been the same!
2016-02-12 19:05:14	Microshrimp	that seems like a very likely assessment

2016-02-13 19:33:31	tomflint	I'm not sure how it started. I think its because a guy said he'd give a pizza to everyone in the /r/kanye sub if Kanye dropped his record in the following hour...

2016-02-13 20:15:27	tomflint	for a while there (around Vigoda's death), reddit was during into the obituaries
2016-02-13 20:15:39	Microshrimp_m	Every time I post something I think is great into a big sub it never gets anything at all
2016-02-13 20:16:22	tomflint	I'm certain they all follow each other and upvote everything that comes into their friend's feeds
2016-02-13 20:16:36	tomflint	its not like they're posting good or interesting things --
2016-02-13 20:16:37	Microshrimp_m	Probably so
2016-02-13 20:16:43	Microshrimp_m	Oh I know
2016-02-13 20:17:05	tomflint	typically the end game is to build up the accounts and sell them off
2016-02-13 20:17:11	tomflint	but you don't get a lot of money for them
2016-02-13 20:17:50	tomflint	before I came on board, /r/pizza was pretty much a running ad for pizza hut and costco
2016-02-13 20:18:35	Microshrimp_m	Oh I can imagine!
2016-02-13 20:19:19	Microshrimp_m	It gets old how much lately you have to dig through sarcastic comments to find any useful information
2016-02-13 20:20:49	tomflint	lately I've been removing some asshole comments. I put them in my list of comments that are automatically removed
2016-02-13 20:21:00	tomflint	they think they're being mean, but they're alone in the world

2016-02-13 20:25:13	tomflint	oh my god..
2016-02-13 20:25:15	tomflint	yeah
2016-02-13 20:25:32	tomflint	do you get a lot of people who don't seem to know what tea is?
2016-02-13 20:26:01	Microshrimp	Here's a crossover of our worlds.  ;)  http://i.imgur.com/5IxWAwW.jpg
2016-02-13 20:26:11	tomflint	haha
2016-02-13 20:26:23	Microshrimp	Oh yeah, we get a lot of people who want to transition from teabags to loose leaf and have a bunch of simple questions
2016-02-13 20:27:08	Microshrimp	And then we get a lot of people who want to drink tea because they think it will be some miracle health cure thing, so we banned all discussions about the health benefits of tea unless you can back up the claims with actual scientific research
2016-02-13 20:28:09	tomflint	haha
2016-02-13 20:28:40	tomflint	I only recently got into tea --
2016-02-13 20:29:01	Microshrimp	Oh yeah?  What kinds have you tried?
2016-02-13 20:29:20	tomflint	my gateway was a coconut oolong from Davids. I've been drinking lapsang soochong on and off for years -- but never at home
2016-02-13 20:29:47	tomflint	now I have a lot of tea. I've mostly been a coffee drinker --
2016-02-13 20:30:38	tomflint	I only have a few cups of coffee per week though.
2016-02-13 20:31:03	Microshrimp	coconut oolong sounds good.  I haven't had the smokeds lapsang souchong in a long time, but I currently have the type of tea that is used for lapsang souchong, the non-smoked version
2016-02-13 20:31:15	Microshrimp	I don't really know anything about coffee at all
2016-02-13 20:31:22	tomflint	nice!
2016-02-13 20:31:26	tomflint	ugh. don't get into coffee
2016-02-13 20:31:35	tomflint	its a pain in the ass
2016-02-13 20:31:42	Microshrimp	hahaa
2016-02-13 20:32:16	Microshrimp	Have you had puerh?
2016-02-13 20:32:33	Microshrimp	the leaves are naturally fermented and aged... the older the better
2016-02-13 20:32:45	tomflint	hm. not that I know of
2016-02-13 20:33:14	tomflint	I'll pick some up. I'm in Vancouver -- so tea is easy to come by
2016-02-13 20:33:37	Microshrimp	It's usually sold in compressed form, and quite a bit of it per unit
2016-02-13 20:34:17	tomflint	yeah, I'm seeing that. It seems to hit everything i want in a tea
2016-02-13 20:34:30	tomflint	does this look ok? http://store.thechineseteashop.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=PUBC-90
2016-02-13 20:34:31		[ http://is.gd/xGqhAP ]
2016-02-13 20:34:58	Microshrimp	That area and into Seatle, etc. seems to have a lot of tea shops
2016-02-13 20:35:57	tomflint	about every ten feet --
2016-02-13 20:36:13	tomflint	and they're all busy. Its insane
2016-02-13 20:36:23	tomflint	even for coffee --- the crappiest coffee shop will be packed
2016-02-13 20:36:29	Microshrimp	There are two types of puerh-- one is called "shou" and the other is "sheng" -- Shou is artificially fermented and tires to mimic the taste of a good natural aged one... but sometimes the artificial aging process doesn't go so well and can result in a bad taste
2016-02-13 20:36:43	Microshrimp	But there's some great shou out there
2016-02-13 20:37:07	tomflint	oh nice. I'll look for the sheng --
2016-02-13 20:37:08	Microshrimp	I would be hesitant to buy a Menghai Tea Factory cake from a vendor I don't know much about because sadly there are a lot of fakes out there. haha
2016-02-13 20:37:11	tomflint	how do they fake it?
2016-02-13 20:37:24	Microshrimp	They just use cheap tea and put the Menghai label on it
2016-02-13 20:37:31	Microshrimp	Some of the might taste good though, you never know
2016-02-13 20:38:09	Microshrimp	Surprisingly I've never heard of that shop, but it looks promising
2016-02-13 20:38:30	Microshrimp	Actually, I just now noticed their price breakdown.  At first I though "$16.95" was for the whole cake, which sounded too good to be true
2016-02-13 20:38:36	tomflint	I think it's the only place in china town with a website
2016-02-13 20:39:23	Microshrimp	Their selection actually does look decent the more I look at it
2016-02-13 20:39:50	tomflint	is it typically about $50 for a full cake?
2016-02-13 20:39:57	Microshrimp	oh, another word for "shou" is "cooked" or "ripe" and another word for "sheng" is "raw"
2016-02-13 20:40:37	Microshrimp	Ah, the prices are all over the map.  I've purchased some good ones for $20 and then I've purchased samples of some which the entire cake would be $400+
2016-02-13 20:40:55	tomflint	its amazing that something has been sitting around fermenting for just under a third of my life or even more
2016-02-13 20:41:07	tomflint	holy shit
2016-02-13 20:41:09	tomflint	thats amazing
2016-02-13 20:41:32	Microshrimp	haha
2016-02-13 20:42:30	Microshrimp	The ideal way is to buy a young one that is cheap and then age it yourself... making sure it doesn't get too dry or too humid, etc.  Keep it away from odors like the kitchen, etc.  And then in 10+ years your cheap tea is now the quality of a really expensive one
2016-02-13 20:42:37	Microshrimp	But that's easier said than done.  lol
2016-02-13 20:42:40	Microshrimp	Part of the hobby though
2016-02-13 20:42:43	tomflint	haha
2016-02-13 20:42:46	tomflint	that's legit!
2016-02-13 20:43:06	Microshrimp	People have been known to buy in bulk and hope to sell later for a profit.
2016-02-13 20:45:46	tomflint	whats the oldest you've seen for it?
2016-02-13 20:45:59	Microshrimp	I drink a lot of oolong too though, which might be a little more friendly to shop for
2016-02-13 20:46:07	Microshrimp	Oldest i've seen is 1970's
2016-02-13 20:46:21	Microshrimp	But price will go WAY up
2016-02-13 20:46:26	tomflint	no doubt. that's insane
2016-02-13 20:46:57	tomflint	ha. 1960s -- only $5500 for 350g
2016-02-13 20:47:09	Microshrimp	Also, that artificial fermentation process I was talking about to make "shou" or "ripe" puerh wasn't invented until the mid 1970's.  So if you see a shou claiming to be from the 1970's or older, it's 100% fake or mislabeled
2016-02-13 20:47:12	Microshrimp	haha
2016-02-13 20:47:22	Microshrimp	that woudl be a good deal
2016-02-13 20:47:23	tomflint	only $73 per cup
2016-02-13 20:47:57	tomflint	my goal is to be in a financial situation where I would order something like that without having to think twice.
2016-02-13 20:48:01	Microshrimp	This is sold out... but here's a pricey one:  http://www.white2tea.com/tea-shop/1995-menghai-factory-7542-hong-kong-storage/
2016-02-13 20:48:02		[ http://is.gd/WSiCkk ]
2016-02-13 20:48:11	Microshrimp	oh that would be so nice
2016-02-13 20:48:30	tomflint	ha. I'm in the wrong business for rolling in cash
2016-02-13 20:48:33	Microshrimp	haha
2016-02-13 20:49:20	Microshrimp	Well, consider that the owner of that store is an American but he now lives in China and spends a lot of time visiting tea farmers out in the middle of no where and drinks through a lot of crap tea just to find the good stuff
2016-02-13 20:49:28	Microshrimp	But he loves what he does and is very very good at it
2016-02-13 20:49:39	tomflint	it wouldn't be such a bad life
2016-02-13 20:49:52	tomflint	mind you, carrying that type of inventory would be stressful
2016-02-13 20:50:18	tomflint	I'm so sick of this 'here super girls for sex' spam
2016-02-13 20:50:41	Microshrimp	Oh yeah.  He recently moved across the entire country (from Beijing to somewhere near Hong Kong) -- I'm sure he had many reasons, but one reason was that he said it would be better for the tea since the climate is hotter down there
2016-02-13 20:50:59	Microshrimp	oh yeah, we get those spams about 3 times a day now
2016-02-13 20:51:16	tomflint	its amazing how similar industries like tea are with cured meats and stuff
2016-02-13 20:51:39	Microshrimp	Ahhh interesting analogy
2016-02-13 20:51:40	tomflint	it all comes down to these ancient processes that rely on the location and simple things like air flowing off an ocean
2016-02-13 20:52:06	Microshrimp	I've always wondered how animal meat can be at room temperature for so long without going bad
2016-02-13 20:54:54	tomflint	the magic of controlled spoilage :)
2016-02-13 20:54:58	tomflint	its a dark art
2016-02-13 20:55:55	Microshrimp	Yeah, sometimes at work people will bring in homemade beef jerky and stuff.. and I'm hesitant to eat it because I don't know these people well enough to know if they know what they are doing. ahha
2016-02-13 20:57:09	tomflint	oh yeah, especially with jerky -- its totally safe to go through
2016-02-13 20:58:13	tomflint	mainly, bacteria needs moisture -- so when the meat is dry on the outer edge or all the way through (like jerky), it acts as a protective barrier. Also the muscles are sterile -- which is good too
2016-02-13 20:58:17	Microshrimp	speaking of food... I gotta get going-- time to eat!  I'll be around later!
2016-02-13 20:59:27	tomflint	word. It's been real.
2016-02-13 21:00:23	@indeedwatson	wow you guys talked a lot
2016-02-13 21:00:25	@indeedwatson	what did i miss

2016-02-14 19:37:41	@Carson	yeah the hosts are smart
2016-02-14 19:37:42	@indeedwatson	the last one i listened was nearly 2 hours
2016-02-14 19:37:49	@Carson	but they don't go indepth enough for me
2016-02-14 19:37:56	@indeedwatson	revenant vs hateful 8
2016-02-14 19:38:31	@Carson	Battleship pretension and Slashfilm cast, even though slash film is very mainstream news
2016-02-14 19:39:21	@Carson	someone should make a podcast about world cinema
2016-02-14 19:39:31	@Carson	like really though
2016-02-14 19:39:36	@Carson	how does it not exist

2016-02-14 19:40:15	@indeedwatson	but then again there's more niche stuff getting podcasts
2016-02-14 19:40:20	sixteenmiles	Hey
2016-02-14 19:40:25	@indeedwatson	hello sixteenmiles 
2016-02-14 19:40:33	sixteenmiles	How's it going
2016-02-14 19:40:45	@indeedwatson	pretty good
2016-02-14 19:40:46	@indeedwatson	you?
2016-02-14 19:40:52	@indeedwatson	we were talking about podcasts
2016-02-14 19:41:06	sixteenmiles	I just watched Spotlight, finishing up my prep for the Oscars.
2016-02-14 19:41:16	@Carson	saw Bridge of Spies last night
2016-02-14 19:41:55	@indeedwatson	sixteenmiles: how was that?
2016-02-14 19:41:59	@indeedwatson	i might go watch it
2016-02-14 19:42:13	@indeedwatson	spotlight and carol are the only things i have interest in seeing at theater 
2016-02-14 19:42:21	@indeedwatson	friend is pressuring me for deadpool but idk
2016-02-14 19:42:41	AlexJ44	film critics over here are taking a very harsh stance on the revenant
2016-02-14 19:42:52	AlexJ44	i'm also dying to watch carol! maybe tomorrow
2016-02-14 19:42:59	sixteenmiles	Good! I thought some of the characters were a bit shallow, but overall it's not bad. I felt a bit like I was watching a TV show more than a film though.
2016-02-14 19:43:02	@indeedwatson	why AlexJ44 
2016-02-14 19:44:55	sixteenmiles	indeedwatson, I hope you don't mind but I was looking through your watchlist earlier. If you are interested, I saw some titles on their that I recommend.
2016-02-14 19:45:03	sixteenmiles	there*
2016-02-14 19:45:22	AlexJ44	indeedwatson , on the revenant?
2016-02-14 19:45:35	AlexJ44	they say it's shallow and a formal exercise without depth or soul
2016-02-14 19:46:01	@indeedwatson	sixteenmiles: why would I mind :) Which ones?
2016-02-14 19:46:09	@indeedwatson	AlexJ44: yeah i get that, they said the same of Birdman
2016-02-14 19:46:21	@indeedwatson	and I agree more on the case of Revenant
2016-02-14 19:46:44	@indeedwatson	but I don't necessarily think it's too bad a thing
2016-02-14 19:47:07	@indeedwatson	Gravity was probably the worst case of that that I can remember recently
2016-02-14 19:47:48	sixteenmiles	indeedwatson: Badlands, The Act of Killing, and to a slightly lesser extent Inside Llewyn Davis,
2016-02-14 19:48:24	@indeedwatson	sixteenmiles: yeah i need to get into Mallick. Act of Killing has been on my watchlist for a long time
2016-02-14 19:48:38	@indeedwatson	and Llewyn Davis somewhow skipped my radar when it was in theaters
2016-02-14 19:49:51	@indeedwatson	sixteenmiles: i made this list with compilation of picks from users here http://letterboxd.com/spookyfox/list/truefilm-picks/ if you're up to it you can give me 10 of your favorites and i'll add them

2016-02-14 19:50:19	sixteenmiles	Let me take a look! They're probably all on there already.
2016-02-14 19:51:13	sixteenmiles	Wow... Someone put Scorpio Rising in their top 10?
2016-02-14 19:52:07	sixteenmiles	And Blue Ruin... Nice to see that film getting some real love.
2016-02-14 19:57:29	@indeedwatson	yeah sadly i can't recall who picked what
2016-02-14 19:57:51	willmatic_	hey all
2016-02-14 19:57:59	@indeedwatson	sixteenmiles: it doesn't have to be 10 if you don't want
2016-02-14 19:58:03	@indeedwatson	hey willmatic_ 
2016-02-14 20:00:16	willmatic_	saw The Revenant in theatre last night. had previously only seen the crappy screener
2016-02-14 20:01:04	@indeedwatson	i bet it made all the difference
2016-02-14 20:01:23	willmatic_	oh yeah. its a quality film in my opinion.
2016-02-14 20:02:36	@Carson	yeah i chose to see it in theater
2016-02-14 20:03:12	@Carson	even though I had downloaded the screener before, so much loss in visual detail
2016-02-14 20:03:25	sixteenmiles	indeedwatson, I'm thinking pretty hard, but narrowing it down to ten is hard. Four that I am certain of: Stalker,
2016-02-14 20:03:25	sixteenmiles	Under the Skin,
2016-02-14 20:03:25	sixteenmiles	Chinatown, and
2016-02-14 20:03:25	sixteenmiles	Apocalypse Now... After that it gets quite muddy.  I would certainly like to see  Hunger and The Thin Red Line up there but after that I'm finding it impossible to be decisive..
2016-02-14 20:04:01	willmatic_	Carson, when it comes out on blu-ray i will appreciate subtitles for Tom Hardy's character. although i realize that was part of the director's vision i still wanna hear 100% of what he says
2016-02-14 20:04:29	@Carson	oh I didn't have many issues with the from what I remember
2016-02-14 20:04:49	@Carson	but I grew up around old family members with similar voices
2016-02-14 20:04:50	@indeedwatson	i guess that's nice about not being native english speaker, we usually get subtitles by default
2016-02-14 20:04:57	willmatic_	also thought the kid who played Jim Bridger was great
2016-02-14 20:05:07	@Carson	dialect I guess
2016-02-14 20:05:16	@indeedwatson	sixteenmiles: i've seen all of those except thin red line
2016-02-14 20:05:18	willmatic_	indeedwatson, are the subtitles in spanish or english?
2016-02-14 20:05:27	@indeedwatson	spanish
2016-02-14 20:05:51	willmatic_	since you're fluent in english is it confusing listening to one language but reading another?
2016-02-14 20:06:43	@indeedwatson	nope, that is actually how i learned english
2016-02-14 20:06:46	AlexJ44	well
2016-02-14 20:06:53	AlexJ44	I want to watch something
2016-02-14 20:07:09	AlexJ44	i'm going to choose from that list
2016-02-14 20:07:34	@indeedwatson	nice
2016-02-14 20:07:35	willmatic_	that's cool
2016-02-14 20:07:54	@indeedwatson	I'm going kinda slow through it
2016-02-14 20:08:20	AlexJ44	nevermind
2016-02-14 20:08:26	AlexJ44	lol
2016-02-14 20:09:31	AlexJ44	I'm torn between
2016-02-14 20:09:36	AlexJ44	"Only on Mondays"
2016-02-14 20:09:38	@Carson	the only best picture nom I haven't seen is The Big Short
2016-02-14 20:09:49	AlexJ44	"The Great Silence "
2016-02-14 20:11:12	AlexJ44	or better yet, I'm going to read a book
2016-02-14 20:11:54	@indeedwatson	why better :p
2016-02-14 20:11:59	@indeedwatson	and what book
2016-02-14 20:12:03	sixteenmiles	This might sound closed minded, but there are a few nominations that I'm just not really interested in watching, so I won't force myself.
2016-02-14 20:12:21	AlexJ44	some portuguese ones
2016-02-14 20:12:23	@Carson	wish I had Adobe Premiere right now
2016-02-14 20:12:25	AlexJ44	gotta catch up on my reading
2016-02-14 20:12:25	@indeedwatson	I don't think it's close minded
2016-02-14 20:12:35	AlexJ44	I watched one hitchcock today though
2016-02-14 20:12:36	@Carson	which sixteen?
2016-02-14 20:12:54	@indeedwatson	AlexJ44: i'm reading catch-22
2016-02-14 20:12:55	sixteenmiles	Brooklyn and Bridge of Spies
2016-02-14 20:13:10	AlexJ44	how are you liking it?
2016-02-14 20:13:23	@Carson	yeah I've seen both and can say they aren't really close to favorites
2016-02-14 20:13:35	@indeedwatson	it's so funny, I wasn't expecting to laugh this much
2016-02-14 20:13:49	@Carson	Mad Max, Bridge, Brooklyn, Martian, I could care less about
2016-02-14 20:13:54	sixteenmiles	I'm sure they are fine in their own right, but I've seen enough films to know when I'm pretty sure I won't enjoy one.
2016-02-14 20:13:56	AlexJ44	it has some great moments
2016-02-14 20:14:12	willmatic_	sixteenmiles, not close minded. i do the same. only watch movies that look interesting to me. if i have to force myself to do anything its a waste of time.
2016-02-14 20:14:18	AlexJ44	some people have a hard time with its non linearity
2016-02-14 20:14:35	sixteenmiles	I have to say about the Martian as well, it baffles me that it was nominated. I really thought it was quite bad.
2016-02-14 20:14:56	willmatic_	same. i didnt think it was bad but nothing special
2016-02-14 20:15:10	willmatic_	decent movie but that's it.
2016-02-14 20:15:18	sixteenmiles	But then it's the Oscars so I guess there is some political reasoning.
2016-02-14 20:15:32	@indeedwatson	i will probably rewatch mad max, but i'll probably never watch any of those others you listed
2016-02-14 20:17:03	@Carson	still haven't seen Carol and that probably should be nominated
2016-02-14 20:17:39	sixteenmiles	Does anybody remember... I don't know if it is last year or the year before... Someone leaked some transcripts from Oscar voting correspondence where they blatantly admitted many biases and even to not watching a number of the films they were voting on?
2016-02-14 20:17:58	@Carson	nope
2016-02-14 20:18:09	@indeedwatson	i don't really pay attention to that stuff
2016-02-14 20:18:16	sixteenmiles	Especially in the animated feature category where one of the voters said they didn't watch any of the films and voted Big Hero 6 because his son liked it.
2016-02-14 20:18:25	@indeedwatson	lol
2016-02-14 20:18:56	@indeedwatson	it's kind of weird that everyone gives the oscars respect but i doubt anyone knows who votes

2016-02-14 20:22:30	@indeedwatson	jesus
2016-02-14 20:22:38	sixteenmiles	I do remember reading it from a better source, but that's all I can find right now.
2016-02-14 20:22:47	@indeedwatson	the irony is that Kaguya is so much better than any of those

2016-02-14 20:31:46	@Carson	do you make lists or mental lists of films you want to see?
2016-02-14 20:32:09	@Carson	feel like I would be on letterboxd everyday typing stuff in if I did a list online
2016-02-14 20:32:20	sixteenmiles	I keep a watchlist on letterboxd
2016-02-14 20:32:28	sixteenmiles	before that I did on icheckmovies
2016-02-14 20:33:10	sixteenmiles	It's surprising how rarely it gets added to.
2016-02-14 20:33:38	@Carson	I enjoy letterboxd a lot, but I feel like it loads pages really slow
2016-02-14 20:33:42	@Carson	maybe it's just me
2016-02-14 20:33:54	@Carson	wish there was a good mobile app for it, I think they just have a webapp
2016-02-14 20:34:06	sixteenmiles	I've had a big problem adding ratings with it, where I will click and then a few seconds later it will say "Unable to update your rating..."
2016-02-14 20:34:23	sixteenmiles	Or it will throw up an error saying "Not all elements on this page have loaded..." or something like that.
2016-02-14 20:34:36	@Carson	looks like they have a beta app for patrons
2016-02-14 20:37:09	sixteenmiles	When you say, a list of films that you want to see. Do you mean any films that you want to watch, or do you specifically mean ones you haven't seen before?
2016-02-14 20:37:17	sixteenmiles	Because I only track the ones I haven't seen before
2016-02-14 20:37:47	@Carson	films never seen before
2016-02-14 20:38:18	sixteenmiles	I think once you get the bulk of it down, you probably won't add new films as often as you might think
2016-02-14 20:39:20	sixteenmiles	But then if you're indecisive like me, you have a nice list to pull from when you do want to watch a film, and you don't have to think about it so much
2016-02-14 20:39:44	@indeedwatson	i always have to think about it because i need to download and that can take like a week
2016-02-14 20:41:42	sixteenmiles	That sucks. If only the world could fix digital distribution.
2016-02-14 20:44:39	@Carson	just moved to family house, they get 1.2 mbps
2016-02-14 20:44:54	@indeedwatson	wow, i'm in 3rd world country and i get more than that
2016-02-14 20:45:14	@Carson	I'm not sure why
2016-02-14 20:45:24	@Carson	they say they pay the most they can
2016-02-14 20:45:40	@Carson	but I think they cant get good fiber in this area
2016-02-14 20:45:53	@Carson	which doesn't make that much sense
2016-02-14 20:46:06	willmatic_	i get 3.5mbps lol
2016-02-14 20:46:44	willmatic_	i live in rural-ish texas. no other providers around
2016-02-14 20:47:52	@indeedwatson	wait do you guys mean the actual speed when you're downloading or the advertised speed
2016-02-14 20:48:25	willmatic_	im talking abput what my actual DL speed is
2016-02-14 20:49:09	willmatic_	my torrents max out at ~440 kilobytes/sec which is about 3.5 mbps

2016-02-14 20:50:52	willmatic_	not megabytes
2016-02-14 20:51:23	willmatic_	its confusing i know but that's what they use. internet speed is in bits. computer data in bytes.
2016-02-14 20:51:57	@indeedwatson	the advertised speed is in bits, i'm pretty sure most torrent clients display bytes
2016-02-14 20:52:20	willmatic_	yeah thats what i was using

2016-02-14 21:48:48	Microshrimp	Carson: were they big subs or somewhat smaller ones?
2016-02-14 21:48:56	@Carson	smaller
2016-02-14 21:49:31	Microshrimp	A lot of the smaller subs probably aren't used to being spam targets so they probably weren't prepared
2016-02-14 21:51:12	Microshrimp	I mod a sub with over 63K subscribers and one with less than 400, and I'll admit that on our smaller sub we haven't really tweaked our settings as much as we have in the big one because we haven't really had any problems... yet.  But it seems the recent spammers are just going at random things instead of targeting the big ones
2016-02-14 21:52:17	Microshrimp	I'll probably just copy over most of our settings from the big sub to the smaller one within the next day or two
2016-02-14 21:53:07	Microshrimp	tomflint:  any particular ones of these documents you recommend getting to sooner than later?
2016-02-14 21:55:37	tomflint	I haven't read a single one. I just went through the different sites I use
2016-02-14 21:57:02	Microshrimp	Ahh ok :)
2016-02-14 21:58:09	@indeedwatson	Microshrimp: I'm currently reading Film Art: an Introduction, and I've read In the Blink of an Eye
2016-02-14 21:59:15	Microshrimp	I was thinking the Film Art Introduction one might be a good starting point.
2016-02-14 21:59:25	@indeedwatson	and i've read Making Movies too

2016-02-16 17:23:55	sixteenmiles	@spooky Was it the editing by any chance?
2016-02-16 18:08:29	spooky	sixteenmiles: it was a combination of the editing (which was annoying and distracting) but the characters too that i couldn't stand. also, the story is of no interest to me
2016-02-16 18:09:06	sixteenmiles	I think I found the story interesting
2016-02-16 18:09:16	sixteenmiles	But I can see how you could get through that film not liking a single character
2016-02-16 18:10:25	sixteenmiles	I grew to like Carell's character as he became more and more disgusted by everyone else in the film.
2016-02-16 18:11:34	@indeedwatson	i might watch it but probably not on theater
2016-02-16 18:13:09	spooky	sixteenmiles: i also didn't like how every once in a while someone looked at the camera and explained what they were talking about. normally i don't mind that, but their tone and arrogance. maybe i was supposed to dislike them as well since they were wallstreet suits, but i found no reason to continue watching
2016-02-16 18:13:54	sixteenmiles	Did you watch it long enough for it to do one of the detours where it would use some technical term and then say "Because you are too dumb to know what this means... Here's Margot Robbie naked to explain it to you."
2016-02-16 18:14:08	@indeedwatson	lol
2016-02-16 18:14:10	spooky	sixteenmiles: i completely hated carrell's character. and they seemed to focus a lot on his big nose
2016-02-16 18:14:39	spooky	sixteenmiles: the scene where margot is in the bathtub drinking champagne is when i turned it off
2016-02-16 18:15:03	sixteenmiles	Haha
2016-02-16 18:15:21	sixteenmiles	It's pretty patronising.
2016-02-16 18:15:41	spooky	i also tried to watch 'vinyl' and it had the same arrogance and annoying structure
2016-02-16 18:15:58	spooky	another one i turned off after a few minutes
2016-02-16 18:16:28	sixteenmiles	I almost watched an episode of that today but ended up watching the walking dead instead.
2016-02-16 18:16:45	sixteenmiles	Which is probably equally as terrible, but I'm too deep down the rabbit hole to stop watching.
2016-02-16 18:16:52	spooky	it is 'fucking' annoying
2016-02-16 18:17:12	spooky	for about 10 minutes the main character is walking around with his mouth constantly open gawking at some medicore band
2016-02-16 18:17:26	spooky	then he begins arrogantly explaining how he's better than you
2016-02-16 18:19:03	sixteenmiles	There's so many TV shows that people are recommending to me at the moment, I don't even know what to do about it.
2016-02-16 18:19:25	@indeedwatson	sixteenmiles: list them
2016-02-16 18:19:40	sixteenmiles	Disclaimer: My friends have terrible taste.
2016-02-16 18:20:07	uguuuuu	which tv shows are these?
2016-02-16 18:20:59	@indeedwatson	i rarely pay attention to tv shows recommendations unless i get them from completely different sources
2016-02-16 18:21:18	sixteenmiles	Mr Robot. Jessica Jones. Marco Polo. The Bridge. The Flash (I will never watch this). Narcos. Probably more that I've forgotten.
2016-02-16 18:21:41	@indeedwatson	i've seen the first two
2016-02-16 18:22:21	@indeedwatson	i've enjoyed them both on a similar level but wouldn't recommend them really
2016-02-16 18:24:07	sixteenmiles	There's not really many TV series that I've really enjoyed where I don't feel like they've just dragged on too long.
2016-02-16 18:25:04	@indeedwatson	what is your favorite show
2016-02-16 18:25:32	sixteenmiles	Uhhhh
2016-02-16 18:25:52	sixteenmiles	Off the top of my head, maybe Six Feet Under
2016-02-16 18:25:59	@indeedwatson	nice
2016-02-16 18:26:03	@indeedwatson	hbo is usually great
2016-02-16 18:26:50	sixteenmiles	More recently I really enjoyed season 2 of Fargo
2016-02-16 18:26:57	sixteenmiles	and both series of True Detective
2016-02-16 18:27:33	@indeedwatson	i tried but i just can't care for any of the characters in fargo s02
2016-02-16 18:27:49	sixteenmiles	Man, I think I really came to like it more than the first series.
2016-02-16 18:28:12	@indeedwatson	i didn't like the 1st season that much either
2016-02-16 18:28:51	sixteenmiles	Now that I think about it, there was one thing at the ending of season 2 that really turned me off.

2016-02-16 18:29:31	sixteenmiles	They kind of retcon a character into a different character from the first series to try and establish some kind of link between the two.
2016-02-16 18:30:05	sixteenmiles	Like "Ho ho ho, this character was that character all along only he got plastic surgery and changed his name so you never could tell... the end."
2016-02-16 18:30:25	@indeedwatson	i don't like the insistence on "this is based on a true story". It was funny in the movie, it was a hommage in season 1. In season 2 it gets old
2016-02-16 18:33:33	sixteenmiles	Fair enough. It didn't really bother me.
2016-02-16 18:33:44	sixteenmiles	I had no strong feelings about it either way.

2016-02-16 22:40:09	tomflint	I work at the kitchen table
2016-02-16 22:40:13	@Carson	ah nice
2016-02-16 22:40:41	tomflint	I have this old ikea table with a leaf. I have a grommet in the middle and some decent cable management below
2016-02-16 22:40:55	@Carson	I'm looking at some mid century modern small cabinets
2016-02-16 22:40:59	@Carson	and coffee table

2016-02-16 22:41:56	@Carson	went to ikea this weekend, everything looked cheap, china

2016-02-16 22:42:43	tomflint	for me, I don't make TVs the focal point for rooms. I like to build in an H with the seating facing each other with the TV at the side
2016-02-16 22:43:01	@Carson	ah i've seen that
2016-02-16 22:43:58	@Carson	the tv placement would be hard though
2016-02-16 22:44:32	tomflint	it depends on a few variables...
2016-02-16 22:44:38	@Carson	walls I gues
2016-02-16 22:44:41	@Carson	guess*
2016-02-16 22:45:45	tomflint	also, you can do it up so you have a couch with the TV in front, but room for chairs in front for when you have people over
2016-02-16 22:46:12	@Carson	yeah true
2016-02-16 22:46:13	tomflint	the KALLAX series from IKEA is boss..
2016-02-16 22:46:35	@Carson	I'll probably have a most tv centered layout though
2016-02-16 22:46:36	tomflint	they're perfect for records. I really like the 2x4 for a TV stand and stuff
2016-02-16 22:46:58	tomflint	put some legs on the bottom http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/10267895/

2016-02-16 22:48:23	@Carson	how many cubes is your kallax lol
2016-02-16 22:48:57	tomflint	I have a 4x4 and a 1x4 now --
2016-02-16 22:49:02	tomflint	but the 2x4 is the best
2016-02-16 22:49:13	tomflint	especially for TV and hiding wiring
2016-02-16 22:49:34	@Carson	I've probably going to invest in a nice mcm small cabinet
2016-02-16 22:49:44	@Carson	for my tv stand
2016-02-16 22:52:54	tomflint	honestly, I like the Kallax for TV stuff purely for the cable management
2016-02-16 22:53:36	tomflint	if you have a small HTPC, records, etc -- you can tuck it all in the spots, then use some basic ties that screw into the back to keep it all hidden
2016-02-16 22:53:48	tomflint	its also nice to store shit loads of books
2016-02-16 22:54:05	tomflint	they also have bins that fit perfectly in there, which is nice

2016-02-16 23:16:02	@Carson	around 700 sq ft
2016-02-16 23:16:02	@Carson	i'm not that worried about the size though

2016-02-16 23:16:32	@Carson	oh yeah forgot to mention I'm moving at the end of march into my first apartment
2016-02-16 23:17:55	tomflint	nice! The main thing is to design your place first and buy around that. Even artwork
2016-02-16 23:19:03	tomflint	its fun to start from scratch
2016-02-16 23:19:15	tomflint	IKEA has a fantastic cable management kit though -- its about $5 too

2016-02-18 18:14:59	Microshrimp	I wish I was more knowledgeable about backup and NAS and all that.  I just have a eSATA/USB3.0 external SATA enclosure and do it the old fashion way. :(
2016-02-18 18:15:27	@inddwtsn	heh, i cant even afford that
2016-02-18 18:15:40	Microshrimp	which means I don't do it as often as I should because it's not automated or anything
2016-02-18 18:15:46	@inddwtsn	i need another internal hdd
2016-02-18 18:16:37	Microshrimp	my reasoning of doing the external drive was so I could put it in a fire safe or something.  But I usually forget and just leave it sitting out
2016-02-18 18:17:06	willmatic_	Washed Out, Toro Y Moi, The Smiths, Oneoftrix Point Never, Mogwai, lots of good classic rap as well, Joy Division.
2016-02-18 18:17:24	tomflint	there -- updated
2016-02-18 18:17:59	Microshrimp	Air Moon Safari is great.  I think I have it on Vinyl
2016-02-18 18:18:12	Microshrimp	Yes I do
2016-02-18 18:19:39	tomflint	get a NAS. It's the best investment
2016-02-18 18:20:05	tomflint	I use Foobar2000 on my htpc -- its the best audio player
2016-02-18 18:21:01	@inddwtsn	i used it for a while
2016-02-18 18:21:07	Microshrimp	I have an Oppo bluray player that can stream FLAC from my main computer, but my better speakers are in a different room
2016-02-18 18:22:53	tomflint	these days I'm using foobar to organize everything too
2016-02-18 18:23:02	tomflint	its not completely automated, but its close
2016-02-18 18:23:15	@inddwtsn	maybe i should try it again with wine
2016-02-18 18:23:24	tomflint	I use it in osx with wine
2016-02-18 18:23:31	@inddwtsn	but i like terminal based music players, but i can't get any to work
2016-02-18 18:23:33	tomflint	also --- my htpc is windows
2016-02-18 18:23:38	Microshrimp	I've used Fubar before and really enjoyed it
2016-02-18 18:23:53	Microshrimp	I grew up using WinAmp :)
2016-02-18 18:24:27	@inddwtsn	I'm not 100% happy with any music players
2016-02-18 18:25:01	tomflint	try foobar again. I'll show you my layout
2016-02-18 18:25:07	Microshrimp	I found a Natalie Portman WinAmp skin years ago and always use it. lol  The original design was annoying because one of the buttons was over her face, so I edited the skin to make the button blend in seamlessly.
2016-02-18 18:25:15	@inddwtsn	i'm very picky with layouts
2016-02-18 18:25:19	@inddwtsn	and UI
2016-02-18 18:25:24	willmatic_	lol wut. natalie portman skin
2016-02-18 18:25:32	@inddwtsn	hahah
2016-02-18 18:25:45	tomflint	you can make foobar look however you want
2016-02-18 18:25:47	Microshrimp	ah, now I'm gonna have to get a screen shot...
2016-02-18 18:25:50	tomflint	http://i.imgur.com/CqofsPf.png
2016-02-18 18:26:22	tomflint	as albums play it automatically loads and saves the cover art.
2016-02-18 18:26:33	@inddwtsn	yeah i'm not a fan of the default button looks
2016-02-18 18:26:36	tomflint	I have the podcasts in the lower right that are pulled in...
2016-02-18 18:26:37	@inddwtsn	there's some neat ones in dA
2016-02-18 18:26:42	tomflint	totally
2016-02-18 18:26:52	«	willmatic_ (~will@cpe-70-114-235-230.austin.res.rr.com) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2016-02-18 18:27:33	tomflint	i love foobar. I've been using it since it came out
2016-02-18 18:27:59	tomflint	my htpc is an older system -- so I always aim for the lightest setups possible
2016-02-18 18:28:05	@inddwtsn	i used to use MediaMonkey for library organizing and tagging and f2k for general listening
2016-02-18 18:28:16	tomflint	I do have some DSP stuff going
2016-02-18 18:28:27	@inddwtsn	a terminal is probably lighter 
2016-02-18 18:28:37	tomflint	you can do all of your tagging in foobar with ease --- well, once you get used to it
2016-02-18 18:29:01	@inddwtsn	does it have automatic tagging and downloads metadata?
2016-02-18 18:29:28	Microshrimp	here it is.  http://i.imgur.com/Qt3iOdn.jpg
2016-02-18 18:29:31	tomflint	yeah, you can use musicbrainz
2016-02-18 18:29:44	tomflint	Microshrimp! that rules
2016-02-18 18:29:46	tomflint	haha
2016-02-18 18:30:00	tomflint	is that yours?
2016-02-18 18:30:07	Microshrimp	Notice the volume button looks like part of her eye... I had to do that because the "pan" button was over her eye, so I had to make that button covered by her eye to blend in
2016-02-18 18:30:13	@inddwtsn	hahahha
2016-02-18 18:30:15	Microshrimp	and the volume button uses the same sample in the skin
2016-02-18 18:30:26	Microshrimp	Someone else made the skin originally, I just made it better :)
2016-02-18 18:30:45	tomflint	you should lower that preamp down to 0
2016-02-18 18:30:53	tomflint	its silly that EQs have + ranges
2016-02-18 18:31:05	@inddwtsn	i rarely use EQ
2016-02-18 18:31:22	tomflint	you should only use them to take down problem frequencies -- never add gain
2016-02-18 18:31:37	Microshrimp	yeah, I'm not even sure why I have that EQ set that like that.  Probably just a mistake
2016-02-18 18:32:00	tomflint	my amp is from the early 70s --
2016-02-18 18:32:19	tomflint	between that and the speakers, it can be a little muddy with the mid range
2016-02-18 18:32:22	@inddwtsn	i should try to set up ncmpdpp again
2016-02-18 18:33:04	@inddwtsn	i'm using a really old audio system + speakers cause i have nothing else, now that i got decent headphones i'll probably only use the speakers while i workout
2016-02-18 18:33:11	Microshrimp	I'm using one of these to power two B&W bookshelfs.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EOKQ9Q6
2016-02-18 18:33:11		[ http://is.gd/5rDN4J ]
2016-02-18 18:33:34	@inddwtsn	nice
2016-02-18 18:33:41	Microshrimp	and for headphones I have AKG K701 and some Headroom amp I bought years ago
2016-02-18 18:34:02	tomflint	nice
2016-02-18 18:34:18	tomflint	70s audio gear is the best though
2016-02-18 18:34:30	tomflint	I have a Marantz 1060 --- its fantastic
2016-02-18 18:36:20	Microshrimp	I hope to put together a better setup one day.  I anticipated it would be easier to pay off student loans and mortgage and all, but it's not going quite as well as planned. :P
2016-02-18 18:36:43	@inddwtsn	audio gear is so expensive
2016-02-18 18:36:54	tomflint	it doesn't have to be though
2016-02-18 18:37:01	tomflint	it probably is in Argentina though...
2016-02-18 18:37:06	Microshrimp	I think there's definitely a sweet spot where you get the most bang for your buck
2016-02-18 18:37:10	tomflint	just find some old stuff from the 70s
2016-02-18 18:37:26	tomflint	especially for the amp / tuner. Give it a good cleaning and it'll love you forever
2016-02-18 18:38:17	@inddwtsn	it'd probably be priced very highly
2016-02-18 18:38:21	tomflint	I originally picked up a Marantz 1060b off of ebay for $80. When I was getting it fixed up, the repair guy said he had a 1060 (a better version) as his shop amp. We did a straight trade.
2016-02-18 18:38:31	@inddwtsn	or you'd need a lot of knowledge to weed through all the things being sold
2016-02-18 18:38:53	Microshrimp	I got my speakers on eBay
2016-02-18 18:39:00	Microshrimp	long story though
2016-02-18 18:40:23	Microshrimp	I bought some B&W speakers at a high school rummage sale fund raiser for a buddy's daughter's volleyball team.  Paid $3.  Found out when I got home that one tweeter wasn't working.  Replacement from B&W was $70 so I started looking on eBay first.  Found whole pair for like $50 or something and decide to just do that instead.
2016-02-18 18:41:25	tomflint	ha nice
2016-02-18 18:41:39	tomflint	the DIY audio crowd is fantastic if you ever want to get into that
2016-02-18 18:41:43	tomflint	they have a channel on here too
2016-02-18 18:41:58	tomflint	I think its this network ---
2016-02-18 18:42:03	tomflint	might be Rizon.
2016-02-18 18:42:30	Microshrimp	There was a pair on Criag's List that I tried to get... but the person selling the speakers only wanted to sell them as a set along with some stupid A/V receiver and a 100 disc CD player.  They Refused my really good offer for just the speakers alone. ha.  Their loss.  I don't think they ever sold the lot
2016-02-18 18:42:53	tomflint	haha
2016-02-18 18:43:15	tomflint	a 100 disc CD player would be handy... if you have CDs
2016-02-18 18:43:25	tomflint	I have friends that have over 10k CDs. It's insane.
2016-02-18 18:44:15	Microshrimp	wow
2016-02-18 18:46:28	tomflint	I have another friend who rips all of his records to minidisc
2016-02-18 18:46:30	tomflint	for real.
2016-02-18 18:46:38	tomflint	thousands and thousands of minidiscs....
2016-02-18 18:47:06	Microshrimp	haha wow
2016-02-18 18:47:31	tomflint	he used to be a DJ -- so he also has a bunch of minidiscs based on moods
2016-02-18 18:47:45	tomflint	its fun to hang out there, but the music is a lot of maintenance
2016-02-18 18:47:53	Microshrimp	The only friend I had who had an interest in audio stuff has moved to another city and I rarely see him in person any more
2016-02-18 18:47:55	@inddwtsn	there must be about 100s CDs in my house gathering dust
2016-02-18 18:48:17	tomflint	I left all of my CDs with my ex-wife
2016-02-18 18:48:18	@inddwtsn	some Beatles one might be worth a few bucks
2016-02-18 18:48:27	Microshrimp	ahh
2016-02-18 18:48:38	tomflint	she probably tossed them, to be honest
2016-02-18 18:49:44	Microshrimp	That's unfortunate :(
2016-02-18 18:49:48	tomflint	but yeah, everyone should have a NAS. It's so handy
2016-02-18 18:49:59	tomflint	especially if you do a lot of downloading -- its nice to have everything on another system
2016-02-18 18:50:15	Microshrimp	Do you do a pre-configured NAS?  I looked in some of the home-made versions
2016-02-18 18:50:16	tomflint	for the most part my downloading is automated.
2016-02-18 18:50:21	Microshrimp	but I don't know enough about that stuff
2016-02-18 18:50:36	tomflint	I have this super shitty one with a modified firmware thats based on Debian --
2016-02-18 18:50:38	Microshrimp	there's like an entire NAS operating system you can run
2016-02-18 18:50:46	tomflint	build your own and run Freenas
2016-02-18 18:50:55	Microshrimp	yeah, that's it
2016-02-18 18:50:57	tomflint	yeah, freenas is super tiny and perfect
2016-02-18 18:51:26	tomflint	it runs on everything too -- and ZFS or whatever is a fantastic format. It's quick
2016-02-18 18:51:44	Microshrimp	yes, the ZFS had me concerned simply because I don't know what it is. haha
2016-02-18 18:51:49	tomflint	i think it'll become the new default file system
2016-02-18 18:51:55	Microshrimp	oh nice
2016-02-18 18:52:08	tomflint	it was developed by Sun but is now being run by an open source group
2016-02-18 18:52:46	tomflint	honestly, spend a few hundred on a good 8TB system or whatever --
2016-02-18 18:53:08	Microshrimp	I remember growing up we had a computer that was set up to dual boot Windows 3.1 and OS/2 Warp. haha
2016-02-18 18:53:43	tomflint	I have about 1.5tb of TV and 778gb of movies
2016-02-18 18:53:49	tomflint	OS/2!!
2016-02-18 18:53:54	tomflint	hahahaa
2016-02-18 18:54:09	Microshrimp	haha yeah!  It was so weird at the time
2016-02-18 18:54:30	tomflint	the computers in my 'state of the art' high school were on OS/2
2016-02-18 18:57:09	tomflint	bookmark this guy's site http://blog.brianmoses.net/2015/01/diy-nas-2015-edition.html
2016-02-18 18:57:10		[ http://is.gd/OAN17J ]
2016-02-18 18:57:24	tomflint	every year he builds a few new NAS boxes for various budgets
2016-02-18 18:59:21	Microshrimp	excellent!
2016-02-18 19:00:02	Microshrimp	one of my biggest regrets is not keeping up with computer stuff as much as I once did
2016-02-18 19:00:20	Microshrimp	It seems like everything just got exponentially more complicated and now I don't even know where to start
2016-02-18 19:00:21	tomflint	it moves too fast
2016-02-18 19:00:40	Microshrimp	I did some free online coding classes a couple years ago, but don't really use the info enough and kinda forgot it now.
2016-02-18 19:01:05	tomflint	my htpc is from 2009 (I've upped the ram and the HD), my NAS is super old and slow, but works...
2016-02-18 19:01:12	tomflint	ha. the CS50?
2016-02-18 19:01:30	Microshrimp	just a bunch of codecademey stuff
2016-02-18 19:01:45	tomflint	nice
2016-02-18 19:02:13	Microshrimp	But years ago when webpages were just basic HTML code...
2016-02-18 19:02:14	@inddwtsn	i started cs50 one
2016-02-18 19:02:16	@inddwtsn	once
2016-02-18 19:02:25	@inddwtsn	but i didn't have linux at the time and it required a VM and i was lazy
2016-02-18 19:02:36	Microshrimp	I could sit down with a piece of paper and a pencil and write HTML code for an entire website
2016-02-18 19:02:39	Microshrimp	now it's super complicated to me

2016-02-18 20:27:05	tomflint	not yet! The best poster though!
2016-02-18 20:27:16	@inddwtsn	I've become a fan of Noe
2016-02-18 20:27:32	MFdood	Me too
2016-02-18 20:27:49	tomflint	is it soft-porny?
2016-02-18 20:27:51	MFdood	mostly through multiple viewings of Enter the Void
2016-02-18 20:28:15	Microshrimp_m	This looks like something I would like
2016-02-18 20:28:21	MFdood	It's a bit past soft-porn
2016-02-18 20:28:24	@inddwtsn	i thought it was more than soft
2016-02-18 20:28:26	tomflint	haha
2016-02-18 20:29:42	Microshrimp_m	What language is it in?

2016-02-18 20:30:15	Microshrimp_m	OK
2016-02-18 20:30:30	MFdood	It was just added to Netflix
2016-02-18 20:30:37	MFdood	in the US at least
2016-02-18 20:30:50	Microshrimp_m	I've been in this French thing the past two weeks ever since seeing Blue Is The Warmest Color and being blown away by it
2016-02-18 20:31:17	Microshrimp_m	So I saw this was in Paris and thought it might be something I should watch sooner than later
2016-02-18 20:31:26	Microshrimp_m	I'll add it to my watch list
2016-02-18 20:31:44	@inddwtsn	it was made to be seen in 3d right?
2016-02-18 20:31:48	MFdood	I don't quite know what I think of it
2016-02-18 20:32:11	MFdood	Yeah I believe so, i meant to see it while it was in theaters but never got around to it
2016-02-18 20:32:39	@inddwtsn	it wasn't in theaters here sadly
2016-02-18 20:34:07	MFdood	Yeah, i really wonder how it changes the film
2016-02-18 20:34:19	MFdood	but i don't have a 3-D capable blu-ray player
2016-02-18 20:35:41	Microshrimp_m	Is Enter the Void on Netflix?

2016-02-18 20:35:59	MFdood	i've got it pulled up right now though, lemme check
2016-02-18 20:36:18	MFdood	Yes it is
2016-02-18 20:37:18	Microshrimp_m	I don't have a Netflix account, buy my brother in law said I could use good password if I ever wanted to watch something.  I haven't had as much time the past couple years to watch stuff so I haven't signed up.  Is it $10/month?
2016-02-18 20:37:31	Microshrimp_m	*use his password
2016-02-18 20:38:00	MFdood	The streaming only option is $7.99 i believe
2016-02-18 20:38:23	@inddwtsn	what other option is there?
2016-02-18 20:38:45	MFdood	Did they finally do away with the dvd's through the mail?
2016-02-18 20:38:52	@inddwtsn	oh
2016-02-18 20:38:57	@inddwtsn	i don't know, i don't netflix
2016-02-18 20:39:16	tomflint	I use a netflix account I found in a forum
2016-02-18 20:39:47	tomflint	it was in some hacker forum. The guy offered it up to the public and will reset the password if anyone messes with it.
2016-02-18 20:39:48	tomflint	haha

2016-02-18 20:43:39	tomflint	i did
2016-02-18 20:43:44	@inddwtsn	and you liked it?
2016-02-18 20:44:20	tomflint	I really did. It still stuck to the typical structure --- but it was pretty good, all things considered
2016-02-18 20:44:46	tomflint	it was filmed near me
2016-02-18 20:45:34	@inddwtsn	huh interesting
2016-02-18 20:46:19	tomflint	I liked that it was self-aware --- pointing out obvious plot holes and stuff

2016-02-18 20:48:57	@inddwtsn	friend insisted but i'd rather spend the money on something else
2016-02-18 20:49:16	MFdood	I feel the same way
2016-02-18 20:49:35	MFdood	Honestly the rabid enthusiasm of the fan-base sort of put me off seeing it for a while
2016-02-18 20:49:40	tomflint	ha. I went on Tuesday --- $6!
2016-02-18 20:50:39	@inddwtsn	i kinda feel the same way i felt about antman, it looked fun, but i didn't go, friend said it was alright. A few months passed and no one remembers it and i feel 0 reasons to watch it

2016-02-18 20:51:26	tomflint	the trouble with every other Marvel picture is that they're the same format --
2016-02-18 20:51:34	tomflint	this one mixed it up a little bit, but not much
2016-02-18 20:52:26	tomflint	its always origin story, meet the bad guy, fight one, love story, fight two -- you think the hero wins BUT NO!, fight 3 (short) -- credits
2016-02-18 20:52:54	@inddwtsn	haha
2016-02-18 20:53:12	@inddwtsn	that sort of applies to the dd and jj too
2016-02-18 20:53:23	MFdood	well as long as they keep making upwards of 100 mil on opening weekend I doubt it will change
2016-02-18 20:53:48	@inddwtsn	I'm sure it will change some day and something will take its place
2016-02-18 20:54:17	tomflint	Superman was the worst for this format
2016-02-18 20:54:23	tomflint	or Man of Steel
2016-02-18 20:54:26	tomflint	such crap
2016-02-18 20:54:59	MFdood	i didn't hate it for the first half of so
2016-02-18 20:55:16	MFdood	but yeah it goes downhill fast
2016-02-18 20:56:24	@inddwtsn	bet you're excited for superman vs batman
2016-02-18 20:57:02	MFdood	hahaha
2016-02-18 20:57:11	MFdood	i don't what i'm less excited for that or suicide squad

2016-02-18 20:57:49	tomflint	oh my god...
2016-02-18 20:58:08	@inddwtsn	just by the concept alone i think ss is more interesting
2016-02-18 20:58:13	@inddwtsn	who's directing it?
2016-02-18 20:58:27	tomflint	yeah, SS should be good -- but I think it'll fall flat
2016-02-18 20:58:41	@inddwtsn	i've not seen any trailer
2016-02-18 20:58:49	MFdood	David Ayer
2016-02-18 20:58:55	@inddwtsn	if it falls flat it won't influence me in the least
2016-02-18 20:59:04	@inddwtsn	if it's any good i'll be gladly surprised
2016-02-18 20:59:13	@inddwtsn	hey has anyone seen The Witch?
2016-02-18 21:00:48	MFdood	I haven't but i'm very curious
2016-02-18 21:01:03	@inddwtsn	i saw tony zhou said it was great
2016-02-18 21:01:16	MFdood	well that's enough for me to give it a shot
2016-02-18 21:02:00	MFdood	i'm just always wary of the 10 or so horror flicks each year that get branded as an "instant classic"

2016-02-18 22:04:54	willmatic_	inddwtsn, how'd you like Better Call Saul?
2016-02-18 22:05:23	@inddwtsn	i forgot to download it D:
2016-02-18 22:05:24	@inddwtsn	i will now
2016-02-18 22:05:51	@inddwtsn	did you watch it?
2016-02-18 22:06:12	willmatic_	yep
2016-02-18 22:06:29	@inddwtsn	how was it?
2016-02-18 22:06:38	tomflint	11-22-63 is a new mini series from Stephen King, JJ Abrams, and James Franco --- and its awesome
2016-02-18 22:07:18	@inddwtsn	i don't like any of those people sadly
2016-02-18 22:07:36	tomflint	Chris Cooper's character is dying of cancer and shows him this closet in his diner that allows him to travel back in time. Cooper's character is convinced that if they can stop the assassination of JFK, it'll have a dramatic and positive impact on history
2016-02-18 22:07:43	tomflint	its really good
2016-02-18 22:08:02	willmatic_	a slow episode. had some good moments though. the ending left me confused.
2016-02-18 22:08:11	willmatic_	i guess we'll find out more later. this time i dont have the luxury of binge watching.
2016-02-18 22:09:22	tomflint	I considered waiting it out -- but I'm hooked
2016-02-18 22:12:25	@Carson	did criterion extend their library more w/ hulu?
2016-02-18 22:12:47	@Carson	don't think I have ever noticed the value of all those criterion films for a few dollars a month
2016-02-18 22:13:19	@Carson	and about 63 show, I've never really like Franco...
2016-02-18 22:13:31	tomflint	he's great in this
2016-02-18 22:13:41	@Carson	I was excited about it until I saw his name
2016-02-18 22:13:46	tomflint	haha
2016-02-18 22:13:55	@Carson	it looks good, and heard the story is interesting
2016-02-18 22:14:59	@Carson	yeah better call saul seemed like a set up/refresh of where the show is headed
2016-02-18 22:15:18	@inddwtsn	he was alright in 127 hours
2016-02-18 22:15:32	@inddwtsn	but as a creator i don't think i've seen anything by him
2016-02-18 22:15:46	@Carson	I didn't enjoy the episode that much, but it had it's moments, the opening scene was really memorable
2016-02-18 22:15:51	@Carson	made me smile really big!
2016-02-18 22:16:45	tomflint	I like Better Call Saul ---
2016-02-18 22:17:01	tomflint	It's amazing that they could pull off a spin-off prequel
2016-02-18 22:17:17	tomflint	I'm not sure we've ever had a TV series where we know the ending up front
2016-02-18 22:17:32	willmatic_	i was discussing that with watson. he it stands on its own quite well. its not just a nostalgia fest
2016-02-18 22:17:58	@Carson	well
2016-02-18 22:18:14	willmatic_	how it*
2016-02-18 22:18:25	@Carson	we don't really know the ending of BCS
2016-02-18 22:19:07	willmatic_	i love the future scenes we get in BCS
2016-02-18 22:19:15	tomflint	oh yeah -- it's totally going to end off on a recreation of the scene where we first see him in Breaking Bad
2016-02-18 22:19:38	@Carson	there are events before BB that may be vital to his character, and also post-BB could potentially become the main storyline of the show
2016-02-18 22:19:44	tomflint	totally
2016-02-18 22:20:22	@Carson	really love BCS, good vibes
2016-02-18 22:21:17	tomflint	its good to get some back story on Mike too
2016-02-18 22:21:25	@Carson	and I didn't even like Saul that much going into it, I know others did, I was too focused on Walter I guess
2016-02-18 22:21:41	willmatic_	i think the mike philly story was one of the best moments of Season 1
2016-02-18 22:21:59	@Carson	yep, highlight episode
2016-02-18 22:22:09	tomflint	honestly, I would enjoy a season of Mike
2016-02-18 22:23:48	@inddwtsn	Carson: yeah i was one of those people

2016-02-18 22:26:00	tomflint	he had a fantastic interview with Jon Stewart on the Daily Show before BCS aired. He was excited but hesitant to get too excited
2016-02-18 22:27:03	tomflint	purely based on the name and some of the cast, I doubt it ---
2016-02-18 22:27:12	tomflint	but who knows. It could be a surprise
2016-02-18 22:28:18	tomflint	my guess is that it'll spiral into that Sons of Anarchy soap-opera crap within the first few episodes
2016-02-18 22:29:12	@Carson	anyone have a chance to watch the Leftovers yet?
2016-02-18 22:29:50	tomflint	I totally gave up on it within 4 episodes
2016-02-18 22:29:57	@Carson	ugh :)
2016-02-18 22:29:58	tomflint	I hated the cigarette smoking group

2016-02-18 22:30:12	@Carson	yeah I hate that a bit too
2016-02-18 22:30:21	tomflint	I stopped watching it to watch The Returned -- which was also total shit.
2016-02-18 22:30:28	@Carson	Season 2 hit it out of the park
2016-02-18 22:30:49	tomflint	Les Revenants was so good -- I was hoping the US one would at least do it service

2016-02-18 22:46:56	@Carson	you can drink the root extract
2016-02-18 22:47:10	@Carson	and you can get really relaxed

2016-02-18 22:47:39	tomflint	ha. you might like valerian root

2016-02-18 22:49:31	tomflint	it'll be more effective to get into your saliva
2016-02-18 22:49:54	tomflint	even make a tincture

2016-02-18 22:50:20	@Carson	idk even know where to get it

2016-02-18 22:50:58	tomflint	valerian root is really calming

2016-02-18 23:14:27	@Carson	would cook with weed if it was legal though
2016-02-18 23:14:52	@inddwtsn	i need to learn to make brownies
2016-02-18 23:14:57	@inddwtsn	and cannabutter
2016-02-18 23:15:51	@Carson	yeah you should just put the butter in the brownies
2016-02-18 23:16:32	@inddwtsn	last time me and my friend tried to make it i think the weed just evaporated
2016-02-18 23:16:56	@Carson	I used to make brownies the wrong way, and cook with the plant directly in it, had so really weird experiences from it, overdosed on it
2016-02-18 23:17:18	@Carson	idk how that happens
2016-02-18 23:17:38	@inddwtsn	what's a weed overdoes tho
2016-02-18 23:19:47	@Carson	well hallucinations, visions, some paranoia, and hits really quick
2016-02-18 23:20:09	@Carson	the brownies I made the wrong way would take 2 hours for you to feel anything

2016-02-18 23:22:35	@Carson	my roommate was freaking out, said something was wrong with his arm, and it was nothing, he wanted to go to the hospital
2016-02-18 23:22:59	@Carson	so funny now
2016-02-18 23:23:10	@inddwtsn	i remember talking to a guy who went to the ER the first and only time he tried weed
2016-02-18 23:24:45	@Carson	watching movies is probably the best part of drugs
2016-02-18 23:24:45	@Carson	for me at least :)
2016-02-18 23:25:54	@inddwtsn	deepends on the drug
2016-02-18 23:26:03	@inddwtsn	but i think listening to music is better
2016-02-18 23:26:16	@Carson	after I had my wisdom teeth removed, I was recovering on drugs I decided to watch Rashomon for the first time
2016-02-18 23:26:44	@Carson	also watched Inherent Vice a lot when I was on weed
2016-02-18 23:27:04	@inddwtsn	yeah that should be fun
2016-02-18 23:27:05	@Carson	made written notes about the film and certain meanings
2016-02-18 23:27:12	@inddwtsn	did they make sense?
2016-02-18 23:27:21	@Carson	IV?
2016-02-18 23:27:25	@Carson	or both movies?
2016-02-18 23:28:01	@Carson	they did IV more, because it was repeated watching
2016-02-18 23:28:09	@inddwtsn	IV, I wouldn't imagine Rashomon being "fun" per se
2016-02-18 23:28:34	@Carson	IV yeah
2016-02-18 23:28:48	@Carson	made sense more than ever

2016-02-19 13:15:18	@indeedwatson	I liked it
2016-02-19 13:15:25	@indeedwatson	but I was kinda expecting more
2016-02-19 13:16:58	sixteenmiles	I've not seen it, but it seems to be the most "cult" film of Cronenberg
2016-02-19 13:17:31	sixteenmiles	It's the film where people seem to say "Oh, you haven't seen Videodrome? You need to see that shit..."
2016-02-19 13:18:10	@indeedwatson	yeah

2016-02-19 13:25:05	willmatic_	i didn't realize that Nikolai was Viggo at first. i took me till about 45 minutes into the film
2016-02-19 13:25:10	sixteenmiles	I enjoyed A History of Violence. I thought The Fly was boring and I just didn't get Crash.
2016-02-19 13:26:46	@indeedwatson	Oh I saw A History of Violence

2016-02-19 13:34:11	sixteenmiles	Did anyone watch Cosmpolis?
2016-02-19 13:34:20	sixteenmiles	Cosmopolis*
2016-02-19 13:49:23	Card1974	Not yet. (I confused that for a moment to Stillman's The Cosmopolitans...)
2016-02-19 13:51:03	Card1974	Incidentally, I just watched Rabid this week, the Arrow release.
2016-02-19 13:52:02	Card1974	Cronenberg's pacing is still a bit slow on that one. Chambers is quite good in her role, too bad she couldn't reach Cronenberg afterwards for more movie opportunities. :/
2016-02-19 13:52:54	sixteenmiles	I know nothing about it other than trailer info.
2016-02-19 13:53:00	sixteenmiles	I mean, the trailer makes it look real bad.
2016-02-19 13:54:48	Card1974	It's a plague / zombie variant. The last third takes its inspiration from Canada's political turmoil in the late 1960s, with the authorities cracking down hard on the population.
2016-02-19 13:58:45	sixteenmiles	So, it's a horror film?
2016-02-19 13:58:50	Card1974	yup
2016-02-19 13:59:40	Card1974	Cronenberg's body horror motif is strong in this one
2016-02-19 14:08:07	Card1974	Hmm. The IMDb featured review sums it up quite well. "Sometimes effective, sometimes dull." I constantly want to like it more than I do... there are weak spots, the boyfriend is wooden, the pacing could be sped up by more aggressive cutting...
2016-02-19 14:08:18	Card1974	but it also gets so much right
2016-02-19 14:11:03	sixteenmiles	I find that I am a lot more judgmental about horror films than nearly any other genre, except for maybe comedy.
2016-02-19 14:12:00	sixteenmiles	I feel like it takes a LOT more to make a good horror film because by their nature they are usually very contrived from the outset.
2016-02-19 14:14:54	sixteenmiles	There are a good horror films but I think it takes a lot more effort from the filmmaker to suspend disbelief enough.
2016-02-19 14:21:10	Card1974	Yeah. The same applies to scifi, too

2016-02-19 14:23:44	sixteenmiles	I don't dislike either genre, and like I say, there are some good/great horror films. It just takes more work to become invested in them.
2016-02-19 14:24:08	Card1974	I'm constantly amazed how few scifi movies I have in my collection, and then I remember - oh yeah, because most films aren't great...
2016-02-19 14:24:52	@indeedwatson	i don't feel it takes more work, but there might be relatively more cheap/lazy/bad horror films
2016-02-19 14:25:22	Card1974	Ture
2016-02-19 14:25:27	Card1974	true, even.
2016-02-19 14:26:15	sixteenmiles	Maybe that's what it is
2016-02-19 14:26:22	@indeedwatson	for me there's always the issue of a good horror film vs a good SCARY horror film
2016-02-19 14:26:28	@indeedwatson	but that's more of a personal issue
2016-02-19 14:26:35	@indeedwatson	cause i'm desensitized
2016-02-19 14:26:39	@indeedwatson	disentesized?
2016-02-19 14:26:40	@indeedwatson	idk
2016-02-19 14:27:22	sixteenmiles	I think contrivance is an issue there, for me at least.
2016-02-19 14:27:41	sixteenmiles	The concept of any given horror film being so unbelievable that it can only feel artificial, and therefore not in any way scary.
2016-02-19 14:28:08	@indeedwatson	that applies to many films and genres tho
2016-02-19 14:28:20	@indeedwatson	but for me mood and atmosphere is what makes it scary
2016-02-19 14:29:40	sixteenmiles	But fear is so instinctive, right? To tap into that you must really have to believe that what you are seeing on the screen is a real threat to yourself.
2016-02-19 14:30:13	@indeedwatson	not really
2016-02-19 14:30:29	@indeedwatson	that is impossible to do unless you're on drugs or something
2016-02-19 14:30:45	@indeedwatson	similarly, you don't need to believe a person died to cry watching a movie
2016-02-19 14:31:07	@indeedwatson	even if you know they're actors and whatnot, a movie can manipulate you into feeling something despite knowing it's a lie
2016-02-19 14:31:39	@indeedwatson	you can have a very realistic setting and not be scared at all because the pacing of the movie is crap and whatnot
2016-02-19 14:31:55	@indeedwatson	I have that problem with movies like The Strangers
2016-02-19 14:31:59	sixteenmiles	I can't remember the last time I felt afraid watching a movie. But it was probably about something that can be thought of in very real terms.
2016-02-19 14:32:06	@indeedwatson	the premise is very plausible
2016-02-19 14:32:11	@indeedwatson	and that scared a lot of people
2016-02-19 14:32:17	@indeedwatson	but I was bored
2016-02-19 14:32:18	Card1974	I still find well made ghost stories scary.  The Innocents, Dark Water, The Conjuring...
2016-02-19 14:32:24	sixteenmiles	Also, I absolutely agree with you, but that's what I was saying. I think it takes a lot more work from the film maker to make a person overcome how unbelievable horror is and to feel scared by it.
2016-02-19 14:32:34	zxc	I watched The Innocents a couple of weeks ago
2016-02-19 14:32:51	zxc	normally like that sort of thing but not sure it was my cup of tea really
2016-02-19 14:33:21	Card1974	I was surprised how effective it was
2016-02-19 14:33:26	@indeedwatson	sixteenmiles: that really depends on person to person. Like I said I'm desensitized, probably because horror videogames are more effective
2016-02-19 14:33:50	@indeedwatson	but AlexJ44 for example gets really scared with something like Paranormal Activity
2016-02-19 14:33:55	zxc	horror videogames definitely have a more direct line to the brain
2016-02-19 14:34:00	@indeedwatson	whereas I found it so boring I skipped to the end
2016-02-19 14:34:26	AlexJ44	hello!

2016-02-19 14:35:20	Card1974	I liked the first PA for what it was, the sequels are just awful.
2016-02-19 14:35:26	@indeedwatson	would you consider it the scariest movie to you?
2016-02-19 14:35:37	zxc	mm alien
2016-02-19 14:35:55	sixteenmiles	I think The Shining is maybe a good example of what you meant by mood and atmosphere evoking fear? Nothing really scary happens in that film, but Kubrick uses a lot of subliminal techniques to make the viewer feel very uneasy while watching it.
2016-02-19 14:35:58	@indeedwatson	I can only recall 2 found footage horror movies I actually like, Blair Witch for what it was at the time, and REC
2016-02-19 14:36:19	@indeedwatson	sixteenmiles: yeah, similar to The Exorcist
2016-02-19 14:36:39	@indeedwatson	I think those are movies that even if you're not scared by them, you can still recognize they're great movies on their own
2016-02-19 14:37:19	Card1974	modern found footage? Cloverfield. Otherwise just go to 1980 and watch Cannibal Holocaust.
2016-02-19 14:37:48	sixteenmiles	PA is garbage btw. :) just throwing that out there.
2016-02-19 14:37:48	@indeedwatson	haven't seen cloverfield, doesnt look like my kind of thing
2016-02-19 14:38:16	Card1974	16m: I don't disagree with that :p
2016-02-19 14:38:46	@indeedwatson	sixteenmiles: what do you think of REC
2016-02-19 14:38:59	sixteenmiles	I've not seen it, I don't think.
2016-02-19 14:39:15	sixteenmiles	Does it have Dexter's sister in it? Or was that a remake? Or something else entirely?
2016-02-19 14:39:53	@indeedwatson	that's the remake
2016-02-19 14:40:00	@indeedwatson	the original is from Spain
2016-02-19 14:40:24	@indeedwatson	maybe the foreign aspect may add some credibility for you, i find that sometimes happens

2016-02-19 14:41:08	AlexJ44	I think it has done something really good with the whole atmosphere
2016-02-19 14:41:19	AlexJ44	you'd be scared if you watched it at a theater, with a good surround
2016-02-19 14:41:23	@indeedwatson	AlexJ44: would you still consider it a good film if it didn't scare you?
2016-02-19 14:41:26	AlexJ44	and yeah, the original rec is good too
2016-02-19 14:41:30	AlexJ44	maybe not
2016-02-19 14:41:35	AlexJ44	it's a good concept though
2016-02-19 14:41:44	sixteenmiles	That reminds me of playing Metro 2033 where I changed the language settings to Russian. Some Russian friends of mine said the RUS voice acting was terrible, but because I didn't understand it, it added so much atmosphere to the game.

2016-02-19 14:43:38	sixteenmiles	Do you think that after a certain amount of time, the whole "found footage" gimmick should probably be shelved?
2016-02-19 14:44:20	@indeedwatson	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2016-02-19 14:44:24	sixteenmiles	I remember watching Blair Witch when it came out and feeling like it really added something, and then in Cloverfield thinking "I guess it's neat" and then now I just think "Oh god, not this again..."
2016-02-19 14:44:26	@indeedwatson	probably shelved and then revived again
2016-02-19 14:44:44	@indeedwatson	when BW came out I thought it was maybe for real

2016-02-19 14:45:33	@indeedwatson	speaking of horror games, i really hope Del Toro and Kojima team up for something
2016-02-19 14:45:58	sixteenmiles	I was exactly 12 when it came out and I think that was the thing
2016-02-19 14:46:28	sixteenmiles	People who had seen it before me told me what it was, and presented it as a documentary of "found footage"
2016-02-19 14:47:48	@indeedwatson	it's funny how that movie sort of started the trend, but the 2nd instalment of it dropped the found footage format
2016-02-19 14:48:12	zxc	there's some creepy footage from a guy that got lost in the paris catacombs

2016-02-19 14:52:52	sixteenmiles	While we're on the subject of found footage, can I share an anecdote about the guy who wrote Chronicle? That weird found footage/super-power film that came out a few years ago?
2016-02-19 14:54:53	sixteenmiles	The writer dropped the full screenplay on a writer's workshop I was a part of, must have been at least 5 years ago. He got a lot of criticism on it and he really raged out over people critiquing his work. Took it really bad, start calling everyone names, being a real asshole to everyone and then disappeared and never came back. Few years later Chro
2016-02-19 14:54:53	sixteenmiles	nicle is released, and we're all thinking "How the hell did this guy get that film made." Turns out he is the son of John Landis... I don't know if that makes a difference but dang that guy was an asshole.

2016-02-19 15:01:26	zxc	but the paris catacombs video I am thinking of is more unclear regarding who it involved, and it could be a hoax too

2016-02-19 15:15:31	sixteenmiles	@indeedwatson, this is actually swaying me a little bit on landis
2016-02-19 15:16:01	sixteenmiles	any judgement I made on him before was based on this tiny slice of interaction, but yeah
2016-02-19 15:16:45	sixteenmiles	He seems to have a lot of the same complaints about cinema as us every-day joe normals.
2016-02-19 15:17:11	@indeedwatson	they did another episode where they had him as a guest and watched B-movies with him, and then showed a short film made by him at the end, that finished swaying me that he's alright
2016-02-19 15:17:19	@indeedwatson	he's just loud and a bit obnoxious
2016-02-19 15:17:27	@indeedwatson	I'm still not interested in most of his work tho
2016-02-19 15:17:49	sixteenmiles	Oh god yeah, they still all look awful
2016-02-19 15:18:19	sixteenmiles	But I like listening to people complain about how many films are just remakes/sequels/adaptations etc.
2016-02-19 15:18:36	sixteenmiles	It helps me justify my own thoughts to myself.

2016-02-19 15:28:39	zxc	the entire film's in a coffin man!
2016-02-19 15:28:40	sixteenmiles	It's a film that suffers from only using one set-piece, but would suffer more for using more than one set-piece because it would lose it's sense of claustrophobia. Probably should have been a stage play instead of a film :(
2016-02-19 15:28:45	@indeedwatson	oh
2016-02-19 15:28:59	@indeedwatson	like that CSI episode directed by Tarantino
2016-02-19 15:29:23	zxc	I rather like films with a single set
2016-02-19 15:30:31	sixteenmiles	So refresh my memory. There is a breach in the coffin and it is filling up with dirt? Or he has a particular amount of time until he runs out of air? Something like that?

2016-02-19 15:30:49	zxc	iirc
2016-02-19 15:30:53	@indeedwatson	that sounds exactly like the CSI episode
2016-02-19 15:32:05	sixteenmiles	And that's the tension in the film. That is the thing that people are hanging on to see, but because the camera can't ever leave the coffin and the film has to reach run time, they throw in all these other things I remember, like a snake gets inside, or he sets himself on fire...

2016-02-19 20:47:30	@indeedwatson	the use of colors was pretty great
2016-02-19 20:47:48	sixteenmiles	But as a character, the opening scene where he is in a comic store (?) and first pulls out his gas mask contraption.
2016-02-19 20:47:52	sixteenmiles	So surreal, right out of the gate.

2016-02-23 20:46:42	@inddwtsn	thread still locked with no explanation
2016-02-23 20:46:45	@inddwtsn	makes me sad
2016-02-23 20:47:10	sixteenmiles	Weird
2016-02-23 20:48:05	@inddwtsn	I really hope The Witch manages to scare me
2016-02-23 20:48:11	@inddwtsn	never watched a good horror film on theater
2016-02-23 20:48:54	sixteenmiles	I just read someone commented that it is being put out by the same production company as Under the Skin
2016-02-23 20:49:01	sixteenmiles	So my interest in it just shot up
2016-02-23 20:49:15	@inddwtsn	woah
2016-02-23 20:49:23	@inddwtsn	as if tony zhou's blessing wasn't enough
2016-02-23 20:49:32	@inddwtsn	i gotta make my friends watch under the skin
2016-02-23 20:49:44	sixteenmiles	haha, that's risky
2016-02-23 20:49:53	sixteenmiles	they might hate you for it
2016-02-23 20:50:23	@inddwtsn	i doubt it, they enjoyed It Follows and it's a bit similar
2016-02-23 20:50:32	sixteenmiles	if your friends are like mine they would much rather watch whatever the new avengers film is
2016-02-23 20:50:57	sixteenmiles	I picked It Follows for our last movie night and they all got bored within about 20 minutes and started playing on their phones
2016-02-23 20:52:20	@inddwtsn	nah, they like both things
2016-02-23 20:52:38	@inddwtsn	they wouldn't go as far as watching avant garde 60's movies 
2016-02-23 20:52:52	@inddwtsn	but something that's a little bit weird and interesting, they're ok with
2016-02-23 20:53:35	sixteenmiles	I put on Scorpio Rising with my wife once (I hadn't seen it). She made me turn it off after a while and I had to rewatch it later.
2016-02-23 20:54:11	@inddwtsn	hah
2016-02-23 20:54:16	@inddwtsn	that's on my watchlist
2016-02-23 20:57:10	sixteenmiles	I don't know where I will be able to watch The Witch
2016-02-23 20:57:23	sixteenmiles	Doesn't look like it's in my local cinema.
2016-02-23 20:57:55	@inddwtsn	i don't think it's out yet
2016-02-23 20:58:44	sixteenmiles	Oh, I thought I saw February 19th as release.
2016-02-23 20:58:48	sixteenmiles	Maybe that is US or prerelease.

2016-02-25 20:00:19	f91w	Are there any other comedies along the lines of Dr. Strangelove?
2016-02-25 20:02:54	sixteenmiles	Well, Lolita is another collab between Kubrick and Sellers and has some darkly funny moments in it.
2016-02-25 20:03:06	sixteenmiles	But I don't think it is trying outright to be a comedy as much as Strangelove was.
2016-02-25 20:04:47	sixteenmiles	This is my favourite scene from the film, which might be considered spoilers or not I don't know: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-afWrWwbrY4
2016-02-25 20:04:48		[ http://is.gd/RK4EuS ]
2016-02-25 20:05:59	sixteenmiles	Sellers is such an uncanny, creepy performance and yet I can't help laugh at the delivery of some of his lines. "What happened to your wife?", "She was hit by a car.", "Gee, no wonder she's not here."
2016-02-25 20:06:14	f91w	Alright. I'll download and watch it. :D
2016-02-25 20:08:16	sixteenmiles	"You have a most interesting face, goodnight."

2016-02-25 20:08:49	sixteenmiles	It drags a bit in parts, and like I say is not outright trying to be a comedy.
2016-02-25 20:09:20	sixteenmiles	The comedy just comes as a byproduct of Sellers, I think.
2016-02-25 20:09:46	@indeedwatson	I didn't remember he was in it

2016-02-25 22:26:41	tomflint	Carol, I believe
2016-02-25 22:26:46	@Carson	oh
2016-02-25 22:26:57	tomflint	it was good -- but not really something worth going out for
2016-02-25 22:27:08	@Carson	yeah I hoping to download it this weekend, looks like their is a good copy of it?
2016-02-25 22:27:44	@Carson	interesting, I've seen some people pick it as the best film of last year
2016-02-25 22:28:08	@Carson	but I've seen move of that with Fury Road eh :(
2016-02-25 22:31:57	@indeedwatson	i really really hope FR wins
2016-02-25 22:32:01	@indeedwatson	even tho i dont care about oscars
2016-02-25 22:32:06	@indeedwatson	i also don't want leo to win
2016-02-25 22:32:15	@Carson	:(
2016-02-25 22:32:59	@Carson	It's either Revenant or Spotlight, i'd be really surprised if it wasn't
2016-02-25 22:33:09	@indeedwatson	but yeah i also saw Carol as several people's best film 2015
2016-02-25 22:33:35	@Carson	yeah same, and they are people I normally agree with
2016-02-25 22:34:06	@indeedwatson	also Ex Machina
2016-02-25 22:34:16	@indeedwatson	which I had no interest in seeing but now I kinda do
2016-02-25 22:34:35	@Carson	I'm predicting The Revenant and Fury Road will have the most wins of the night
2016-02-25 22:35:04	@Carson	Spotlight will win best picture because of it's a true story
2016-02-25 22:35:15	@Carson	and has more of an impact
2016-02-25 22:35:31	@Carson	with reality... idk what I'm saying
2016-02-25 22:35:50	@indeedwatson	i understand what you're saying
2016-02-25 22:35:57	@indeedwatson	but i also think it's silly
2016-02-25 22:36:05	@Carson	Argo, 12 years, same thing
2016-02-25 22:36:07	@indeedwatson	not silly that you say it, silly that people choose based on that
2016-02-25 22:36:17	@Carson	idk what else recently
2016-02-25 22:36:20	@indeedwatson	wtf argo won best film?
2016-02-25 22:36:31	@Carson	yep
2016-02-25 22:36:35	@Carson	I was surprised
2016-02-25 22:37:02	@indeedwatson	that is so dumb
2016-02-25 22:37:09	@indeedwatson	now i gotta check what it was competing against
2016-02-25 22:37:50	@indeedwatson	i didn't think it was a bad movie but pretty bland
2016-02-25 22:38:53	@indeedwatson	It won against Amour
2016-02-25 22:38:54	@Carson	Life of Pi, Lincoln, Silver Linings, Zero Dark Thirty, Amour, Django Les Mis
2016-02-25 22:39:01	@indeedwatson	what the flying fuck
2016-02-25 22:39:12	@Carson	Amour wouldn't have won without Argo
2016-02-25 22:39:21	@Carson	I thought Lincoln would win that year
2016-02-25 22:39:21	@indeedwatson	i know it's just..
2016-02-25 22:39:23	@indeedwatson	ugh
2016-02-25 22:39:42	@indeedwatson	i watched lincoln and barely remember it
2016-02-25 22:39:49	@indeedwatson	i've not seen silver linings and les mis
2016-02-25 22:40:01	@Carson	I don't think the Oscars are often correct, I just think it is fun to predict what the academy will vote for
2016-02-25 22:40:19	@Carson	I've seen all the noms for that year
2016-02-25 22:40:34	@indeedwatson	i wanted to watch les mis but not before reading the book
2016-02-25 22:40:55	@indeedwatson	still haven't read the book and that hulk article made me not want to watch it altogether
2016-02-25 22:41:19	@Carson	yeah the new one is eh, unless you like Hugh Jackman
2016-02-25 22:41:44	@indeedwatson	he's alright, but not enough to watch a movie just for him

2016-02-25 22:48:01	@Carson	I have the Revenant winning on my list now, with leo for best actor, and brie larson for best actress
2016-02-25 22:48:36	@Carson	rooney mara for best supporting actress and tom hardy for best supporting actor
2016-02-25 22:49:00	@indeedwatson	i do hope hardy wins
2016-02-25 22:49:13	@indeedwatson	the categories are so silly
2016-02-25 22:49:15	@Carson	I think revenant will sweep the top categories
2016-02-25 22:49:31	@Carson	and Fury road will get all the sfx and best director
2016-02-25 22:50:02	@Carson	tom hardy has a new tv show that will be on FX network tomflint
2016-02-25 22:52:00	@indeedwatson	interesting
2016-02-25 22:52:06	@indeedwatson	have you seen BCS?
2016-02-25 22:52:15	@Carson	yes we have talked about it
2016-02-25 22:52:17	@Carson	saw this weeks
2016-02-25 22:52:35	@indeedwatson	oh i missed the talk?
2016-02-25 22:52:58	@Carson	no I didn't know if you were asking if I've ever watched it
2016-02-25 22:53:17	@Carson	I haven't been on much this week, I haven't talked about it at least
2016-02-25 22:53:21	@Carson	good episode
2016-02-25 22:53:26	@indeedwatson	i was asking about 2nd ep yeah
2016-02-25 22:53:54	@Carson	really good episode though
2016-02-25 22:54:07	@Carson	starting to see where it's headed
2016-02-25 22:54:15	@Carson	really like being in the BCS world
2016-02-25 22:54:16	@indeedwatson	yeah i like the little small details
2016-02-25 22:54:34	@Carson	just watched the trailer for tom hardy show, looks okay :/
2016-02-25 22:54:35	@indeedwatson	ep 1 at the end, how they added tension with that bit of tape on the switch
2016-02-25 22:54:58	@indeedwatson	and ep2 where he basically wants to have his cake and eat it too and that's how the episode ends :p
2016-02-25 22:55:06	@indeedwatson	link?
2016-02-25 22:56:01	@Carson	I like the characters ,and the idea of Jimmy having this con artist nature in his blood, he can't resist and no love from his brother
2016-02-25 22:56:31	@Carson	i want him to do good, but we know where it's headed

2016-02-25 22:56:57	@indeedwatson	yeah i don't want the episodes to end while i'm watching, I missed that feeling
2016-02-25 22:57:01	@Carson	Taboo looks like a show that might not need to exist, idk
2016-02-25 22:57:13	@indeedwatson	woah ridley scott
2016-02-25 22:57:21	@Carson	so many good actors in it
2016-02-25 22:58:20	@indeedwatson	FX must be rolling in dough
2016-02-25 22:58:41	@Carson	they have a lot of shows that I don't want to watch though, that look mediocre

2016-02-25 23:00:14	@Carson	haven't heard anything good about it
2016-02-25 23:00:35	@indeedwatson	i believe tomflint was talking about it with someone else a few days ago
2016-02-25 23:00:50	tomflint	2 episodes in!
2016-02-25 23:00:58	@Carson	is it good?
2016-02-25 23:01:04	tomflint	its decent --
2016-02-25 23:01:05	@Carson	i've seen some bad reviews
2016-02-25 23:01:08	@Carson	oh
2016-02-25 23:01:20	tomflint	I mean, its not like its an amazing story to begin with...
2016-02-25 23:01:29	@Carson	I'm really excited about 11 22 63 now, seems like it's the best new show out this year
2016-02-25 23:01:34	tomflint	its like the shitty episodes of Boardwalk ---
2016-02-25 23:01:41	tomflint	11-22-63 OWNS
2016-02-25 23:02:04	@Carson	I was so skeptical, would probably give it a pass but i'm hearing a lot of good things
2016-02-25 23:02:14	@Carson	and the sci fi concepts seem really interesting to play with
2016-02-25 23:02:57	tomflint	its really good
2016-02-25 23:03:07	tomflint	the second episode held up to the pilot too
2016-02-25 23:03:29	tomflint	... which is rare these days
2016-02-25 23:03:34	@indeedwatson	I never heard of that one
2016-02-25 23:03:47	tomflint	I'm still in it with Better Call Saul -- but its a little too slow.
2016-02-25 23:08:02	@Carson	it doesn't bother me
2016-02-25 23:08:17	tomflint	I enjoy it -- but I want more Mike
2016-02-25 23:08:38	@indeedwatson	i love slow
2016-02-25 23:08:43	tomflint	in a lot of ways, Better Call Saul feels like Odenkirk's experience in Hollywood
2016-02-25 23:08:47	@Carson	I'm sure we will get it, especially because of how well last season mike episode was
2016-02-25 23:09:11	@Carson	yeah it's not really focused highly on the plot
2016-02-25 23:09:25	tomflint	that was my favorite episode
2016-02-25 23:09:28	@Carson	it's more of getting places to set up the plot kind of stuff
2016-02-25 23:09:33	tomflint	he's the coolest character
2016-02-25 23:10:09	@indeedwatson	I think it's the kind of character you don't want to overuse
2016-02-25 23:10:12	@Carson	that dorky guy with the hummer kind of takes me out of it a bit though

2016-02-25 23:11:23	@Carson	apparently there is a theory about that character

2016-02-25 23:12:08	@Carson	Saul says that Danny owns this place, and the character with the hummer, his real name is Daniel

2016-02-28 01:02:37	Carson-PHONE	Tomflint I actually didn't like the first episode that much
2016-02-28 01:02:45	tomflint	ha
2016-02-28 01:02:55	tomflint	don't watch the rest then!
2016-02-28 01:03:02	Carson-PHONE	Kind of a letdown
2016-02-28 01:03:15	@indeedwatson	Carson-PHONE: why not
2016-02-28 01:03:24	Carson-PHONE	Is ep 2 any better?
2016-02-28 01:03:26	@indeedwatson	i haven't seen it, i want to know if i'll find it worth it
2016-02-28 01:03:56	tomflint	I felt like the first episode was a little rushed -- but a lot of the backstory that was skipped up front is shown later
2016-02-28 01:05:10	Carson-PHONE	Wasn't getting into the story, some of the dialogue felt forced, camera movement and shots often felt a little weak
2016-02-28 01:05:27	Carson-PHONE	I'm sure the ending might be better though

2016-02-28 01:06:39	tomflint	I love Chris Cooper
2016-02-28 01:06:58	Carson-PHONE	The color correction felt forced in the present time
2016-02-28 01:07:01	tomflint	He's a modern Gene Hackman --- that guy who leads without leading
2016-02-28 01:07:19	Carson-PHONE	Relationship between Franco and student felt forced and odd
2016-02-28 01:07:49	tomflint	keep in mind that that's the pilot -- those are rarely good
2016-02-28 01:10:00	Carson-PHONE	Like this isn't how it would really play out
2016-02-28 01:10:00	Carson-PHONE	And what's with all the obstacles at the Texmex restaurant ?
2016-02-28 01:10:00	Carson-PHONE	Yeah true I suppose
2016-02-28 01:10:00	Carson-PHONE	Mini series too
2016-02-28 01:10:00	Carson-PHONE	Based on book, has limitations
2016-02-28 01:10:13	Carson-PHONE	Made me want to watch madmen 🙂
2016-02-28 01:11:04	@indeedwatson	you haven't seen mad men?
2016-02-28 01:11:42	tomflint	you haven't watched MADMEN?!?
2016-02-28 01:19:52	@indeedwatson	I think I'm starting to like r/flicks more than r/truefilm
2016-02-28 01:31:40	Carson-PHONE	No I've seen it lol
2016-02-28 01:31:58	Carson-PHONE	Seen it a few times all the way through
2016-02-28 01:32:10	Carson-PHONE	I just meant watch it again
2016-02-28 01:33:13	Carson-PHONE	For some reason mad men doesn't get as old because it's a mellow drama and its driven by core plot most of the time
2016-02-28 01:34:43	@indeedwatson	yeah i should rewatch too but it'll probably be a while before i do
2016-02-28 01:36:58	@Carson	is everyone going to be on during the Oscars tomorrow night?
2016-02-28 01:39:28	@Carson	well guess not
2016-02-28 01:42:30	@indeedwatson	i probably will
2016-02-28 01:43:42	@Carson	wonder if we should do a post to get more people in here?
2016-02-28 01:44:46	@indeedwatson	sure
2016-02-28 01:45:20	@Carson	hmm maybe tomorrow afternoon a few hours before the beginning

2016-03-01 16:23:32	@indeedwatson	I'm pretty good, watching Blue Velvet, what have you been up to AlexJ44 
2016-03-01 16:23:33	@indeedwatson	and hello sixteenmiles 
2016-03-01 16:23:44	AlexJ44	hello sixteenmiles !
2016-03-01 16:23:51	AlexJ44	i watched andrei rublev yesterday
2016-03-01 16:23:54	AlexJ44	the whole 3 hours of it
2016-03-01 16:24:06	AlexJ44	I'm proud of such achievement
2016-03-01 16:24:09	@indeedwatson	did you like it?
2016-03-01 16:25:09	sixteenmiles	It looks like possibly the most difficult of Tarkovsky's work
2016-03-01 16:25:18	sixteenmiles	I've not dared try and watch it yet myself
2016-03-01 16:27:05	@indeedwatson	based on length maybe, but The Mirror is more confusing
2016-03-01 16:27:13	@indeedwatson	I haven't seen his last 2 movies tho
2016-03-01 16:27:24	AlexJ44	are you sure sixteenmiles ? I've heard it's the most accessible
2016-03-01 16:27:30	AlexJ44	or should that one be ivan's childhood?
2016-03-01 16:27:46	AlexJ44	i liked it
2016-03-01 16:27:54	@indeedwatson	ivan's is quite definitely more accesible
2016-03-01 16:28:09	@indeedwatson	solaris too probably
2016-03-01 16:28:13	AlexJ44	plus I watched it in a theater with no cell phone coverage
2016-03-01 16:28:17	@indeedwatson	maybe stalker too
2016-03-01 16:28:18	sixteenmiles	I'm no expert. I've only seen Stalker.
2016-03-01 16:28:19	AlexJ44	so I wasn't distracted by anything
2016-03-01 16:28:26	@indeedwatson	damn, so lucky
2016-03-01 16:28:39	AlexJ44	yeah, it was nice
2016-03-01 16:28:53	AlexJ44	my football team was playing at the same time, in quite an important game, but I thought
2016-03-01 16:28:53	AlexJ44	well
2016-03-01 16:29:03	AlexJ44	what are the odds i'll ever see tarkovsky in a screen again
2016-03-01 16:29:23	@indeedwatson	I very likely never will
2016-03-01 16:30:04	sixteenmiles	A few years ago I got to see Akira on the big screen and it blew me away like nothing else.
2016-03-01 16:30:04	sixteenmiles	Some films you just can't beat that experience.
2016-03-01 16:30:09	@indeedwatson	or maybe if i catch a cycle, but the screen probably won't be that big
2016-03-01 16:30:36	AlexJ44	there was a cycle recently
2016-03-01 16:30:48	AlexJ44	a city near me was showing all of his filmography in a week
2016-03-01 16:30:55	AlexJ44	like, starting at 2Pm and ending at midnight
2016-03-01 16:30:59	AlexJ44	something like that for 5 straight days
2016-03-01 16:31:01	AlexJ44	it was crazy
2016-03-01 16:31:23	@indeedwatson	wow
2016-03-01 16:31:28	@indeedwatson	i would have watched them all
2016-03-01 16:32:59	AlexJ44	haha it was a bad week for me, otherwise I would have gone there
2016-03-01 16:33:06	AlexJ44	but I haven't watched much in the last weeks
2016-03-01 16:33:15	AlexJ44	i've seen 20 films this year, which is not much
2016-03-01 16:33:25	AlexJ44	and I've got plenty to see!
2016-03-01 16:33:27	uguuuu	ive seen two

2016-03-01 16:34:53	@indeedwatson	nice
2016-03-01 16:34:56	sixteenmiles	I just found out that Radiohead did a song for Spectre but were edged out in favour of Sam Smith.
2016-03-01 16:34:59	sixteenmiles	And it's awesome.
2016-03-01 16:35:13	@indeedwatson	i like one radiohead song
2016-03-01 16:35:17	@indeedwatson	pyramid song
2016-03-01 16:35:17	AlexJ44	yeah
2016-03-01 16:35:21	AlexJ44	they're awesome
2016-03-01 16:35:22	sixteenmiles	Man
2016-03-01 16:35:29	sixteenmiles	This song is very much like Pyramid Song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv-w0zPSsTs
2016-03-01 16:35:29		[ http://is.gd/NdoCf3 ]
2016-03-01 16:35:30	AlexJ44	I made two special shows on them
2016-03-01 16:35:36	sixteenmiles	It's like Pyramid Song meets Codex
2016-03-01 16:35:41	AlexJ44	yeah, there are some vibes
2016-03-01 16:35:48	AlexJ44	it would be so great to have them sing the theme song
2016-03-01 16:36:25	sixteenmiles	Which shows Alex?
2016-03-01 16:37:57	AlexJ44	podcasts
2016-03-01 16:38:08	AlexJ44	one of them was 1h dedicated to their whole oeuvre
2016-03-01 16:38:16	AlexJ44	from pablo honey to TKOL
2016-03-01 16:38:36	AlexJ44	the second one I had some guests over, and we talked a lot about them. it's quite good, if you speak portuguese
2016-03-01 16:38:48	sixteenmiles	I don't :(
2016-03-01 16:39:00	sixteenmiles	I always find it a great judge of character to ask people their favourite radiohead album.
2016-03-01 16:39:11	AlexJ44	yeah

2016-03-01 16:39:44	AlexJ44	mine is In Rainbows
2016-03-01 16:39:48	sixteenmiles	Ah
2016-03-01 16:39:52	sixteenmiles	Amnesiac for me.
2016-03-01 16:40:06	uguuuu	uncommon choice!
2016-03-01 16:40:10	AlexJ44	which I feel is always a very safe choice when someone asks
2016-03-01 16:40:19	AlexJ44	amensiac is a tougher one to swallow lol

2016-03-01 16:40:47	AlexJ44	yeah
2016-03-01 16:40:55	AlexJ44	in rainbows rivals those, imo
2016-03-01 16:40:57	AlexJ44	it's that good
2016-03-01 16:41:21	AlexJ44	they are playing over here in the summer, I'll hopefully go. too bad it's a festival that's not very well frequented
2016-03-01 16:43:44	sixteenmiles	I've actually never listened to In Rainbows all the way through
2016-03-01 16:43:53	sixteenmiles	Despite listening to every other album multiple times through.
2016-03-01 16:44:39	AlexJ44	whoa

2016-03-02 21:14:50	@indeedwatson	ah i can't help you there tomflint since i don't have a bouncher
2016-03-02 21:15:21	tomflint	it was weird. I couldn't get the right fingerprint --
2016-03-02 21:15:42	@indeedwatson	when was this
2016-03-02 21:15:56	tomflint	30 minutes ago or so
2016-03-02 21:16:16	@indeedwatson	did you ask in #weechat?
2016-03-02 21:20:54	tomflint	nah, I'll sort it out later
2016-03-02 21:21:36	tomflint	the main issue is that I'm in this one crazy busy channel -- so you'll get 20+ lines in a burst. I need to quickly scroll up
2016-03-02 21:21:49	spooky	<Microshrimp_m> I need to figure out how to set up a bouncer <-- you need a shell account which allows you to run and irc proxy program like psybnc or znc
2016-03-02 21:22:29	@indeedwatson	tomflint: you can set any binding to scroll up
2016-03-02 21:24:09	tomflint	God bless the sushi restaurants that offer 'combos' that are the same price as ordering it in pieces
2016-03-02 21:24:29	tomflint	double bless them for saying 'no substitutions'
2016-03-02 21:25:12	@indeedwatson	i haven't had sushi in years
2016-03-02 21:28:21	tomflint	I have it about once a week
2016-03-02 21:28:34	tomflint	vancouver has too many places though
2016-03-02 21:28:56	@indeedwatson	there's only one place in my town, so they can overcharge and make horrible sushi
2016-03-02 21:29:02	tomflint	ha
2016-03-02 21:29:05	@indeedwatson	plus sushi itself is not filling to me at all
2016-03-02 21:29:11	@indeedwatson	so i'd need to eat a lot
2016-03-02 21:29:24	tomflint	does Arg have good local fish?
2016-03-02 21:29:37	@indeedwatson	if you live near the coast
2016-03-02 21:29:39	@indeedwatson	which i don't
2016-03-02 21:30:16	tomflint	with some fish it's best if its caught early and used late --
2016-03-02 21:30:39	tomflint	it gives time for the muscles and stuff to settle. But so much of the fish has been frozen for several days
2016-03-02 21:30:57	@indeedwatson	salmon is so expensive here
2016-03-02 21:31:32	tomflint	and really, its not that great for a fish ---
2016-03-02 21:31:40	tomflint	mind you, around here we eat a lot of salmon
2016-03-02 21:32:15	@indeedwatson	i don't think i've ever had salmon outside of sushi
2016-03-02 21:32:35	@indeedwatson	or any fish except the one that's cheapest which i don't recall the name of
2016-03-02 21:33:04	tomflint	for you guys I think that'd be trout

2016-03-02 21:39:08	tomflint	interesting
2016-03-02 21:39:16	tomflint	I like cod
2016-03-02 21:39:25	@indeedwatson	usually we make it breaded and fried

2016-03-02 21:40:44	@indeedwatson	i really want to try things like squid and crab but I don't think it'd be worth it if it's not more fresh

2016-03-03 23:39:51	AlexJ44	I've heard people saying it was one of the year's best
2016-03-03 23:40:04	AlexJ44	it's just rocky with a black guy with tons of references to previous filmes
2016-03-03 23:40:05	AlexJ44	films*
2016-03-03 23:40:20	@Carson	no most people give that to Fury Road, which I don't agree with
2016-03-03 23:41:00	@Carson	what's your top films from last year?
2016-03-03 23:41:05	AlexJ44	same narrative, same arc, clinging to adonis' relationship to his father and the weight of the name

2016-03-06 20:11:19	@Carson	tomflint I got an oil diffuser
2016-03-06 20:11:28	tomflint	nice!
2016-03-06 20:11:32	tomflint	how do you like it?
2016-03-06 20:13:22	@indeedwatson	I guided an online friend through making his first pizza
2016-03-06 20:13:30	tomflint	haha
2016-03-06 20:14:21	@Carson	yes I like it
2016-03-06 20:15:19	@Carson	got it as a gift, and I got eucalyptus and lemongrass
2016-03-06 20:15:24	@Carson	and I already have lavender
2016-03-06 20:15:35	@Carson	I like lavender the best so far
2016-03-06 20:15:46	tomflint	if you find that you start to grow boobs, stop using the lavender for a few weeks
2016-03-06 20:15:57	tomflint	Im not sure if it happens with adults, but that can happen to young boys
2016-03-06 20:16:07	@Carson	woah
2016-03-06 20:16:09	@indeedwatson	wat
2016-03-06 20:16:10	@Carson	that's scary
2016-03-06 20:16:13	tomflint	ha. its hilarious
2016-03-06 20:16:18	@Carson	that explains a few things
2016-03-06 20:16:20	@Carson	...
2016-03-06 20:16:21	tomflint	it goes away within a few weeks
2016-03-06 20:16:59	@indeedwatson	he was ready to dump his gf
2016-03-06 20:17:24	@Carson	problem is when we were testing it out, we put lemongrass in it first, we put a few drops in and it a bit too strong, but I can't seem to get the smell out of it,
2016-03-06 20:17:57	@Carson	I read online that you can use vinegar to mask it
2016-03-06 20:18:00	@Carson	but idk
2016-03-06 20:18:41	tomflint	oh yeah -- lemongrass is crazy strong
2016-03-06 20:18:47	tomflint	with most oils, do a drop at a time
2016-03-06 20:18:54	@Carson	I wish i knew...
2016-03-06 20:19:05	@Carson	read online to put 6 drops...
2016-03-06 20:19:09	@Carson	now regretting
2016-03-06 20:19:12	tomflint	haha
2016-03-06 20:19:37	tomflint	I once had a horrible experience with lemongrass ----
2016-03-06 20:19:46	@Carson	I'm sick of lemongrass too
2016-03-06 20:20:00	@Carson	trying to OD in lavender now
2016-03-06 20:20:02	tomflint	I was in some crazy pain after a lot of surgeries and stuff ---
2016-03-06 20:20:11	tomflint	she's all 'I'll run you a bath with some lemongrass'
2016-03-06 20:20:26	tomflint	I get into the bath and discover that she put in way too much oil --- and my balls are burning!
2016-03-06 20:21:16	@Carson	oh I had a bad experience with tea tree oil...
2016-03-06 20:22:05	@Carson	3 weeks till I move!
2016-03-06 20:22:27	@Carson	and I'm glad I'm not the only one who still enjoys baths
2016-03-06 20:22:31	tomflint	tea tree is amazing, though
2016-03-06 20:22:40	@Carson	how so?
2016-03-06 20:22:45	tomflint	tea tree in a spray is one of the best things to clean your skin
2016-03-06 20:23:02	tomflint	250ml of distilled water, two or three drops of tea tree -- bam.
2016-03-06 20:23:18	@Carson	but I don't think I diluted it enough, idk, the oil was sold for hair treatment
2016-03-06 20:23:43	@Carson	seen some horror stories of burned skin
2016-03-06 20:23:58	tomflint	ha. yeah -- just start with one or two drops and build up over time
2016-03-06 20:24:06	tomflint	the oils are strong
2016-03-06 20:26:09	tomflint	if you get into mixing essential oils, you can start making cologne and stuff too
2016-03-06 20:26:20	tomflint	essential oils have some amazing healing properties.
2016-03-06 20:26:55	@Carson	what others would you recommend, more for health benefits?
2016-03-06 20:27:59	tomflint	dig through here -- http://www.aromaweb.com/essentialoils/
2016-03-06 20:28:00		[ http://is.gd/6B7eAt ]
2016-03-06 20:28:28	tomflint	for instance, a drop or two of vetiver on the base of your neck does wonders for ADHD
2016-03-06 20:30:12	tomflint	my favorite oils are vetiver (a light, toasty grass note), cedarwood atlas (like a camp fire -- pure smoke), any citrus ---
2016-03-06 20:31:28	@Carson	okay thanks
2016-03-06 20:31:46	@Carson	any favorite brands that I can get at any health food store?
2016-03-06 20:32:45	tomflint	find a soap and candle supply place --
2016-03-06 20:32:49	tomflint	you're in NC?
2016-03-06 20:34:16	tomflint	oils shouldn't be too expensive either. Compare the pricing to http://voyageursoapandcandle.com -- those are a little higher than they should be.
2016-03-06 20:34:16		[ http://is.gd/lElfd0 ]
2016-03-06 20:35:09	@Carson	ok thanks
2016-03-06 20:37:47	tomflint	if you decide to make candles, use fragrance oils, though. They're designed to be burned. Some essential oils will catch on fire
2016-03-06 20:38:18	tomflint	if you find a good supplier, you can start making everything from toothpaste, deodorant, sprays, lip chap, and more
2016-03-06 20:41:59	@Carson	yeah I was thinking about adding it to deodorant some how
2016-03-06 20:42:29	@Carson	I'm been using toms aluminum free deodorant but doesn't mask smell very well
2016-03-06 20:54:34	AlexJ44	 what do you use an oil mixer for?
2016-03-06 20:54:44	AlexJ44	and why would you grow boobs with lavender?
2016-03-06 20:55:00	@indeedwatson	i think the 2nd question answers the 1st
2016-03-06 21:02:45	@Carson	well
2016-03-06 21:03:08	@Carson	oil diffuser helps the smell of a room
2016-03-06 21:03:26	@Carson	and there are a lot of health benefits for specific oils
2016-03-06 21:03:40	@Carson	a lot of them help you feel more relaxed
2016-03-06 21:05:35	tomflint	AlexJ44: its called 'Gynecomastia' --
2016-03-06 21:05:46	AlexJ44	LOL @indeedwatson
2016-03-06 21:06:06	tomflint	it boosts estrogen --
2016-03-06 21:06:10	@Carson	tomflint trying to find a mega download for episode 3 of 112263
2016-03-06 21:06:12	tomflint	I think its mainly with young boys though
2016-03-06 21:06:25	@indeedwatson	tomflint: is that the new lars von trier movie?
2016-03-06 21:06:48	tomflint	Carson: it hasn't been posted yet
2016-03-06 21:07:08	@Carson	really episode 3 premiered last Monday I though
2016-03-06 21:07:11	@Carson	thought*
2016-03-06 21:07:38	tomflint	oh wait! it is!
2016-03-06 21:07:54	tomflint	no idea where to find mega links --
2016-03-06 21:08:06	tomflint	that was a great episode. What sort of quality are you looking for?
2016-03-06 21:08:35	@Carson	good enough
2016-03-06 21:08:43	@Carson	less than 1gb is fine
2016-03-06 21:09:21	tomflint	I wish my upload were faster ---
2016-03-06 21:09:35	tomflint	why not just get it off a torrent site?
2016-03-06 21:11:13	AlexJ44	has anyone seen the tv show utopia?
2016-03-06 21:11:52	willmatic_	yeah its good

2016-03-06 21:13:21	@indeedwatson	i liked first series, 2nd ran out of steam
2016-03-06 21:13:50	tomflint	Utopia S1 was wicked

2016-03-07 00:19:40	@indeedwatson	have you read Dune?
2016-03-07 00:28:08	@Carson	not sure if I can handle that
2016-03-07 00:28:47	@Carson	whats the best Murakami?
2016-03-07 01:05:52	ujm	i've only read 2 but i enjoyed norwegian wood
2016-03-07 01:15:18	tecu	I think The Wind-up Bird Chronicle and Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World might be the best
2016-03-07 01:16:11	tecu	Sputnik Sweetheart, 1Q84 and Dance Dance Dance are all great too
2016-03-07 01:16:28	tecu	and Kafka on the Shore, I guess
2016-03-07 01:22:49	uguuuu	you basically named all of his books!
2016-03-07 01:23:33	tecu	I only named two!
2016-03-07 01:23:43	tecu	...and then kept going in case someone didn't like my selection
2016-03-07 01:24:09	uguuuu	hmm
2016-03-07 01:24:11	uguuuu	i'll allow it
2016-03-07 01:24:23	tecu	Norwegian Wood is nice, too
2016-03-07 01:24:43	tecu	but I think just reading his short story "Firefly" does the job much better

2016-03-08 22:38:17	@indeedwatson	sup
2016-03-08 22:38:30	@indeedwatson	fuck i forgot to watch BCS
2016-03-08 22:39:37	@Carson	it came out last night
2016-03-08 22:39:56	@Carson	I would watch tonight but can't download or stream here
2016-03-08 22:40:05	@Carson	i saw Hateful Eight last night
2016-03-08 22:40:11	@indeedwatson	yeah i downloaded it already
2016-03-08 22:40:16	@indeedwatson	what did you think?
2016-03-08 22:40:26	@Carson	and that ending, I couldn't look away
2016-03-08 22:40:29	@Carson	I like it a lot more than I thought
2016-03-08 22:40:44	@Carson	about halfway through it really picked up
2016-03-08 22:41:10	@Carson	first half was good too, just got a little bored watching everyone get introduced
2016-03-08 22:41:21	@indeedwatson	that was my experience pretty much
2016-03-08 22:41:36	@Carson	every aspect of the film was really well done
2016-03-08 22:42:05	@indeedwatson	i liked it way more than IB and Django
2016-03-08 22:42:15	@Carson	some of the characters they introduced in the flashback seemed a little out of place, maybe that was the intent
2016-03-08 22:42:33	@Carson	yeah I think I liked it more than Django as well but I haven't rewatched it
2016-03-08 22:43:29	@indeedwatson	the music was so good
2016-03-08 22:43:45	@Carson	yep
2016-03-08 22:44:13	@Carson	really fun, and going into it I wasn't sure if I would like it
2016-03-08 22:47:16	@Carson	actors were great, really caught me by surprise
2016-03-08 22:48:10	@indeedwatson	tim roth was great at playing christoph waltz :p
2016-03-08 22:48:59	@Carson	true
2016-03-08 22:49:29	@Carson	feel like I also wanted to stay with these characters / world longer
2016-03-08 22:49:42	@Carson	by the end, I was like please please please show us more
2016-03-08 22:51:34	@Carson	indeedwatson what should I watch tonight?
2016-03-08 22:51:46	@Carson	bone tomahawk?
2016-03-08 22:52:18	@indeedwatson	i've not heard of that
2016-03-08 22:52:48	@indeedwatson	watch The Witch and tell me if it lives up to the hype :)
2016-03-08 22:53:09	@indeedwatson	btw did you pick a book to read?
2016-03-08 22:53:32	@Carson	nope
2016-03-08 22:53:40	@Carson	i'll focus on movies for now anyways
2016-03-08 22:53:58	@Carson	heard good things about Bone Tomahawk
2016-03-08 22:54:07	@Carson	is the Witch out to download?
2016-03-08 22:54:38	@indeedwatson	no idea, it comes out in theaters in two weeks here
2016-03-08 22:55:10	@indeedwatson	and i really hope watching a good horror movie in theater manages to scare me
2016-03-08 23:00:50	@Carson	watching Best of Enemies
2016-03-08 23:01:39	@indeedwatson	havent heard of that either
2016-03-08 23:02:02	@Carson	it's a documentary about a news debate
2016-03-08 23:03:55	@indeedwatson	i gtg sleep, i'll ask you tomorrow what you thought of it
