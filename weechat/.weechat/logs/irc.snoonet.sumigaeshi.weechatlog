2015-11-23 23:09:48	sumiGaeshi	bruh would you date a girl that you really liked but you found out at the last moment that she's in or close to the world of sex work
2015-11-23 23:10:19	sumiGaeshi	or what if she just had a background of being very sexually promiscuous
2015-11-23 23:10:38	inddwtsn	im not sure
2015-11-23 23:10:40	inddwtsn	why
2015-11-23 23:10:41	inddwtsn	who
2015-11-23 23:10:54	inddwtsn	also i thought you didn't care about what your gurl does with other men
2015-11-23 23:11:03	sumiGaeshi	would coctail waitress be an issue
2015-11-23 23:11:05	sumiGaeshi	stripper
2015-11-23 23:11:16	sumiGaeshi	masseuse
2015-11-23 23:11:21	inddwtsn	you're in love with a stripper?
2015-11-23 23:11:26	sumiGaeshi	prostitute
2015-11-23 23:11:42	inddwtsn	you're in love with a girl with 4 jobs?
2015-11-23 23:11:58	sumiGaeshi	lol i'm just wondering what you think
2015-11-23 23:12:44	inddwtsn	i've pondered on this but regarding camming
2015-11-23 23:12:53	inddwtsn	and i don't think i'd like it
2015-11-23 23:12:55	sumiGaeshi	yeah camming as well
2015-11-23 23:13:07	sumiGaeshi	one of my besties has dated a cam girl for a while
2015-11-23 23:13:33	sumiGaeshi	she asctually super sweet and endearing, i kind of assumed she would be a cunt before i had met her
2015-11-23 23:13:54	inddwtsn	why
2015-11-23 23:14:07	sumiGaeshi	because i have preconceived notions of people
2015-11-23 23:14:57	inddwtsn	based on her job?
2015-11-23 23:15:32	sumiGaeshi	yeah
2015-11-23 23:15:49	sumiGaeshi	someone camming like that is usually not very intelligent
2015-11-23 23:15:53	sumiGaeshi	and is taking a shortcut
2015-11-23 23:15:56	inddwtsn	why would you assume that
2015-11-23 23:16:02	sumiGaeshi	which to me denotes lack of character
2015-11-23 23:16:05	inddwtsn	i disagree
2015-11-23 23:16:11	sumiGaeshi	not in all cases
2015-11-23 23:16:14	sumiGaeshi	but more often than not
2015-11-23 23:16:16	inddwtsn	it's just a job
2015-11-23 23:16:29	sumiGaeshi	regardless, i really like her now
2015-11-23 23:16:39	sumiGaeshi	maybe i'm a little less prejudiced now
2015-11-23 23:16:55	inddwtsn	how many men would cam if it was as profitable as it is for a gril
2015-11-23 23:17:12	sumiGaeshi	but yeah would your potential gf being a cam girl or stripper or prostitute be a deal breaker
2015-11-23 23:17:34	sumiGaeshi	plenty of dumb men who are short cited with lack of character
2015-11-23 23:17:52	inddwtsn	maybe
2015-11-23 23:18:16	inddwtsn	i mean camgirl wouldn't be as bad as stripper or prostitute obv
2015-11-23 23:18:32	inddwtsn	camgirl would probably be below smoking
2015-11-23 23:18:55	sumiGaeshi	well camgirl vs stripper is interesting
2015-11-23 23:19:18	sumiGaeshi	because camgirl is prob more revealing
2015-11-23 23:19:29	inddwtsn	i guess
2015-11-23 23:19:41	sumiGaeshi	but you didn't answer the question
2015-11-23 23:19:44	sumiGaeshi	you keep avoid
2015-11-23 23:20:05	inddwtsn	i can't give a clear answer because it'd depend a lot on the girl
2015-11-23 23:20:17	inddwtsn	but generally, yes it would be a deal breaker
2015-11-23 23:20:55	sumiGaeshi	how come?
2015-11-23 23:21:26	sumiGaeshi	what about the gf that's in love with you and is no longer a ho, but has had 80 different partners in the year prior to meeting you
2015-11-23 23:22:11	inddwtsn	why would i know that
2015-11-23 23:22:20	sumiGaeshi	maybe it came up
2015-11-23 23:22:30	inddwtsn	idk i'd feel eh about it
2015-11-23 23:22:36	inddwtsn	but it depends on the girl
2015-11-23 23:22:52	inddwtsn	i didn' think i'd date a girl with a baby but i did
2015-11-23 23:22:59	inddwtsn	although not for very long lol
2015-11-23 23:23:16	sumiGaeshi	you were at her house and wondered why there was a jumbo family sized box of condoms she bought from the manufacturer
2015-11-23 23:23:35	inddwtsn	-_-
2015-11-23 23:23:49	inddwtsn	i'd hope she says "for tonight"
2015-11-23 23:24:06	sumiGaeshi	no she said because she goes through 40 a week
2015-11-23 23:24:11	sumiGaeshi	but she's changed
2015-11-23 23:24:24	sumiGaeshi	XD
2015-11-23 23:26:32	sumiGaeshi	i ask because my close friends who are older than me and i was the only one in the group who would say they didn't give a fuck
2015-11-23 23:26:45	sumiGaeshi	maybe i'm an outlier in that way
2015-11-23 23:27:36	inddwtsn	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2015-11-23 23:27:56	inddwtsn	i can't say it's because of values or principles
2015-11-23 23:28:00	inddwtsn	it's just the way i feel
2015-11-23 23:28:10	inddwtsn	it probably stems from insecurities
2015-11-23 23:28:29	sumiGaeshi	how far is buenos ares from civilized peru
2015-11-23 23:28:40	sumiGaeshi	@ask RoboCop map pls
2015-11-23 23:29:00	sumiGaeshi	my friends want to go out there to hallucinate :]
2015-11-23 23:29:53	inddwtsn	3 days by bus
2015-11-23 23:29:54	inddwtsn	apparently
2015-11-23 23:30:07	inddwtsn	to lima
2015-11-23 23:30:16	sumiGaeshi	that's a lot
2015-11-23 23:30:42	inddwtsn	i wanna plan a trip for next year

2015-11-23 23:31:49	inddwtsn	yeaaaaaah i dont think it's easy to get into the us
2015-11-23 23:31:57	sumiGaeshi	really?
2015-11-23 23:32:00	sumiGaeshi	how come
2015-11-23 23:32:20	inddwtsn	im guessing getting a visa takes a lot of time and money
2015-11-23 23:32:47	sumiGaeshi	to get my visa in the us was not a big deal
2015-11-23 23:32:51	sumiGaeshi	took time ye
