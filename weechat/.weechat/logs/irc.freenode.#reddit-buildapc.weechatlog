2015-08-13 16:44:37	Craig4	oh god oh god
2015-08-13 16:44:40	Craig4	i forgot to pay my student loans
2015-08-13 16:44:40	+Jappetto	ik0u, you could, but generally i've seen the 860k based systems cost just as much/more
2015-08-13 16:44:40	+AnimalFarmPig	MarkRobbo_: save some money
2015-08-13 16:44:42	cpu1	MarkRobbo_: sata3 is a big advantage because it lets you take advantage of 64mb harddrive cache

2015-08-13 16:45:03	+Jappetto	eh...
2015-08-13 16:45:03	Craig4	i don't see any late fees

2015-08-13 16:45:06	Soulvaki	It's fine, Craig4.
2015-08-13 16:45:09	shrimp	centipede15: probably 15-30% off what you bought it at

2015-08-13 16:45:13	Soulvaki	I paid mine a week late once.

2015-08-13 16:45:26	+MarkRobbo_	AnimalFarmPig: true, I have no clue what the costs are but fact is, in terms of retail pricing the boards with just 2xsata3 are significantly cheaper
2015-08-13 16:45:27	ik0u	Jappetto: He's selling all his console shit to come to PC

2015-08-13 16:45:37	+Jappetto	ik0u, imo, there's a bottom line where you just shouldn't bother building
2015-08-13 16:45:38	Craig4	if i remember correctly, i think only after 30 days late it gets reported to the credit beureu?  soulvaki
2015-08-13 16:45:47	+Jappetto	for gaming anyways
2015-08-13 16:45:47	Craig4	i'm just used to paying like $4,000, and $5,000 at at time

2015-08-13 16:45:54	ik0u	He was going to buy a prebuilt APU system
2015-08-13 16:45:55	ik0u	Off amazon
2015-08-13 16:45:57	centipede15	shrimp: I got it for $1000, so $600 - $700?
2015-08-13 16:45:57	ik0u	For the same price
2015-08-13 16:45:59	Craig4	tomorrow i get paid, plus my quarterly bonus
2015-08-13 16:46:00	Rocks	markrobo: you're right. so I guess if I spend 25 more to get 20-30 off, it's a net gain
2015-08-13 16:46:04	+MarkRobbo_	real world performance difference on sata 2 vs 3 with hdds is nada cpu1
2015-08-13 16:46:04	Craig4	so i might just pay off my loans next week
2015-08-13 16:46:05	Craig4	wooooooooo

2015-08-14 01:14:02	JamesRam	Guys, I have a question, I used to have 8gb of ram because it said I was using over 7gb of ram while playing GTA. So I got a total of 16gb of ram and now I'm using 11gb of ram? why is it when I got more ram it increased the amount of ram allocated?
2015-08-14 01:14:48	taxable	because it can jamesram
2015-08-14 01:14:49	cpu1	JamesRam: GTA probably has a cache that is ram dependent
2015-08-14 01:14:50	+AnimalFarmPig	JamesRam: because your operating system sees that you have more RAM and uses it instead of just letting it sit there
2015-08-14 01:14:53	taxable	why not
2015-08-14 01:15:02	+AnimalFarmPig	that is correct behaviour
2015-08-14 01:15:04	stormscape	Because RAM is there to be used
2015-08-14 01:15:20	JamesRam	But I wasn't using all the ram before

2015-08-14 01:15:39	JamesRam	I C
2015-08-14 01:15:44	stormscape	your system was just using your paging file more before

2015-08-14 11:03:24	+nRRe	Mitchb777: well it all comes, as you get better mechanics, then you start learning the champs and matchups, then you start on the game knowledge, when to p ush/freeze lanes, when to gank other lanes, when to call for objectives
2015-08-14 11:03:25	PCbuilder|R	we know who i like playing :d

2015-08-14 11:04:09	PCbuilder|R	main thing is understand what each champ is and can you win trades, understanding the map and jungler timmings/ where he might be to tell if your about to be ganked or not

2015-08-14 14:01:46	+DefunctProcess	10% more voltage = 10% m ore power draw
2015-08-14 14:01:50	+DefunctProcess	more or less
2015-08-14 14:01:53	jrajav	The reason I ask is because Galax is implying my PSU might be the issue causing instability

2015-08-14 14:54:11	jrajav	It's a very high performing air cooling case but that's not all everyone wants

2015-08-14 14:54:37	jrajav	And I think it has a lot less to do with the placement of the fans

2015-08-14 14:55:33	wumbo	it makes a minor difference tho
2015-08-14 14:55:48	jrajav	It's about as minor as positive/negative pressure. Not enough to matter for like, anything
2015-08-14 14:55:52	wumbo	when coupled with those 3 fans
2015-08-14 14:55:56	shep1	I wanted a semi-mod. I don't need it, it just means there's less cables sticking around, right?

2015-08-14 14:56:12	wumbo	only 1 of those fans are actually pointed at the graphics cards though

2015-08-14 14:56:21	wumbo	it justifies it in the ft02
2015-08-14 14:56:24	wumbo	dunno about other cases
2015-08-14 14:56:25	jrajav	I think the reason the ft02 is good is 1) 3 180mm's, and 2) Direct airflow onto the cards wumbo 
2015-08-14 14:56:29	jrajav	And that's it
2015-08-14 14:56:36	wumbo	jrajav: only 1 of the 180mms point onto the cars

2015-08-14 15:06:53	+PhantomTaco	outdoes the phanteks
2015-08-14 15:06:57	+PhantomTaco	according to spcr
2015-08-14 15:06:58	+Lavins	Phanteks has teh 140mms down pat
2015-08-14 15:07:00	wumbo	even corsails thinks 120mm is better than 140mm in static pressure kek

2015-08-14 15:07:23	wumbo	wow the sp140 is theoretically louder than the sp120

2015-08-14 15:08:23	wumbo	and they both have a similar design
2015-08-14 15:08:28	wumbo	and cost pretty much the same

2015-08-14 15:10:15	+PhantomTaco	"To say that we were surprised that the Antec TwoCool 140 won our performance test is an understatement of the greatest degree. Considering that the TwoCool 120 came in near the bottom of our last 120 mm fan roundup, the 140's excellence seemed to come out of no where. It's funny to see two fans with such similar designs ending up at opposite ends of the spectrum. Like its little brother, the 140 is plagued by clicking at lower

2015-08-14 15:11:44	wumbo	im willing to bet the clicking is because of the fan controller
2015-08-14 15:11:51	wumbo	and the fact that it probably uses pwm to control voltage

2015-08-14 15:13:41	wumbo	aquaero 5 sheds off the extra voltage as heat

2015-08-14 21:11:06	wumbo	stock max tdp is like 220w

2015-08-14 21:12:24	wumbo	it's because of the architecture iirc
2015-08-14 21:12:39	jrajav	wumbo: Well before I started this the boost clock was 1227. Doesn't divide by 13
2015-08-14 21:12:50	wumbo	the stock clock doesnt divide by 13

2015-08-14 21:13:52	wumbo	if you look at the table of clocks for kepler/maxwell cards
2015-08-14 21:13:58	wumbo	each clock is a 13 offset from the clock under it
2015-08-14 21:14:15	wumbo	you can confirm this yourself by dumping your bios, and opening it with maxwell bios editor
2015-08-14 21:14:38	jrajav	Okay so you're saying when I see 1227mhz in afterburner /gpu-z
2015-08-14 21:14:44	jrajav	That's actually that 1228.5 increment?
2015-08-14 21:14:58	wumbo	it's about there yes
2015-08-14 21:15:11	jrajav	Which means my particular gpu has an offset of -1.5mhz
2015-08-14 21:15:12	wumbo	wait no
2015-08-14 21:15:22	wumbo	thats a chart for a kepler card iirc
2015-08-14 21:15:26	jrajav	Or it's just margin of error
2015-08-14 21:15:26	wumbo	or a 980
2015-08-14 21:15:27	wumbo	not a 980ti
2015-08-14 21:15:33	wumbo	you have to open your bios

2015-08-14 21:16:25	stormscape	guys, ever heard of this before: my GPU won't overclock in benchmarks. In actual games, it'll go to 1060/1350 no problem, but if I run Cinebench/3DMark, it reverts back to 925/1250.

2015-08-14 21:20:52	twitchytoes	If I pulled the taps and put it 60w over voltage, I could probably hit 1600mhz.

Was wondering if I should spend the money on a 500gb 850 evo and get rid of the old one, or get a 250gb 850 evo and use it with the old one that I have? Is it worth it to save the 85$?
2015-08-14 21:28:06	twitchytoes	But yeah, I think it'd look super nice to have a black backplate on a 290x ref cooler in a black/red build.

I recently ran a 512 GB consumer Crucial SSD into the ground after only a year of this behaviour. Any recommendations?

2015-08-14 22:30:45	Portaljacker	so how many watts would i need for potential room for sli and overclocking of cpu & gpu in the future?

2015-08-14 23:07:24	Syphlyn29	Anyways the bigger issue is the video card buzzing
2015-08-14 23:07:28	Portaljacker	oh so it's a hack
2015-08-14 23:07:29	DrDisconsented	Sounds like signal noise due to load, plug it into the motherboard directly and see if that changes anything Syphlyn29

2015-08-15 01:08:56	krazymouse	Hey guys, I've just built this new PC, and everything has been working great for the past week, but all of a sudden, my computer has been strangely acting up with different programs. Google Chrome has been getting the "Aw Snap" error with non loading pages, while some programs like spotify and such don't even boot up any more, even after I reinstal
2015-08-15 01:08:56	krazymouse	l. I'm assuming this is all related to my PC, because all these issues started occuring all at once tonight. Any idea what may be causing it?

2015-08-15 02:48:11	taxable	evga lower end stuff is good i used it for my mothers build and she hasn't complained to me
2015-08-15 02:48:31	taxable	umm
2015-08-15 02:48:36	taxable	do you need that 1 TB hard drive?
2015-08-15 02:48:58	taxable	$50 more in ssd can go a long way
2015-08-15 02:49:08	taxable	i'm sure you can get the 250GB for 99
2015-08-15 02:49:11	StarTech	do you have any specific ones?

2015-08-15 02:49:21	taxable	oh
2015-08-15 02:49:42	taxable	probably a cheap one since you seem to be on a budget

2015-08-15 10:55:11	Torvon	Stealing the HDMI from my TV solved the problems. It was posting fine and just not sending any video output over DSUB. Not sure why, but I guess its irrelevant now.

Can I clone my boot drive to one of the hard drives and then format current SSD and then just do a fresh install?

2015-08-15 12:16:52	leecherby	taxable: for gaming low latency / reponse time, IPS, good panel quality
2015-08-15 12:17:00	leecherby	taxable: IPS just for nice colors
2015-08-15 12:17:04	leecherby	TN is unbareable imo

2015-08-15 12:17:32	leecherby	depends on TN
2015-08-15 12:17:54	leecherby	yes if you look at it straight ahead it's fine but multi monitor setups for example... forget about it
2015-08-15 12:18:00	leecherby	because nvidia forces the monitors to be positioned the same way
2015-08-15 12:18:01	taxable	but this is a monitor

2015-08-15 14:04:59	+PhantomTaco	you could go to matx motherboard and case

2015-08-15 14:05:33	Barry21	I'm aiming for £771, possible without any performance changes?

2015-08-15 14:53:30	LikeABox	Elfen Lied best anime
2015-08-15 14:53:36	annaheim	GloriousPeasant, very good show
2015-08-15 14:53:37	nick125	there was one thanksgiving break where I watched like...5 seasons of House. Don't recommend trying it.

2015-08-15 14:53:46	LikeABox	well first episode, as soon as the violent underage nudity peters down it gets kinda boring
2015-08-15 14:53:57	GloriousPeasant	annaheim it's quite good, but i'm not sure it's a 9.1 that imdb ratings say it is
2015-08-15 14:54:01	annaheim	because of fight club element on the show. then they got split.
2015-08-15 14:54:17	annaheim	GloriousPeasant, that's fine. as long as it isn't 10

2015-08-15 16:27:58	Yuken	Markq, for like 5 quid more, there is an 850EVO SSD, iirc.
2015-08-15 16:28:10	Yuken	Markq, much faster than the BX100 (although the BX is still a great drive)

2015-08-15 16:44:38	Markq	Also the case can is sold by Amazon in the UK?

2015-08-15 16:49:49	PolyHC	instead of buying a new laptop
2015-08-15 16:49:50	stormscape	PCbuilder|R_, yes
2015-08-15 16:49:59	stormscape	you can put any 2 slot PCIe card in it
2015-08-15 16:50:02	PCbuilder|R_	 never seem them before tbh, but 290x is a decent card
2015-08-15 16:50:32	CustardFilled	PCbuilder|R_, muh 290x
2015-08-15 16:50:39	PolyHC	so in theory I can? afraid to hurt the cpu which is an ulv dual core
2015-08-15 16:50:48	stormscape	of course, with one of these the limiting factor is USB3's bandwidth

2015-08-15 16:52:15	GloriousPeasant	PolyHC bottlenecking is kinda bs most of the time. 2011 Cpus are still fine for most single gpu setups
2015-08-15 16:52:23	SwitchedFromAMD	ive tried 4 keyboards, they all work but not past BIOS
2015-08-15 16:52:25	GloriousPeasant	if you go further back then yeah it becomes more of an issue
2015-08-15 16:52:29	Beardless_One	Bottleneck = your cpu is slow
2015-08-15 16:52:29	Beardless_One	that's it
2015-08-15 16:52:40	PolyHC	bottlenecking is when CPU performance limits GPU performance
2015-08-15 16:52:40	PCbuilder|R_	stormscape:  so its a waste of time using a 290x in that thing, because of the usb3 connector? or am I miss reading/ me stupid as always

2015-08-16 18:43:10	Yuken	cortrell, first, to make sure it is vibrations. If you hold your fingers, with a small amount of pressure, on top of the case, can you feel the vibrations or does the noise stop?
2015-08-16 18:43:17	Yuken	IT should not be dangerous at all.

2015-08-16 22:29:16	mrtekn0	and Keltin itll be quite a bit more than that
2015-08-16 22:29:18	Yuken	One second.
2015-08-16 22:29:21	Yuken	mrtekn0, nope.
2015-08-16 22:29:25	Yuken	mrtekn0, he never said what settings.
2015-08-16 22:29:29	Yuken	$365 can easily fit in a 265 and 860k

2015-08-16 22:30:17	Yuken	mrtekn0, 265 beats the PS4 by a little bit.

2015-08-16 22:30:40	Yuken	speedysnorlax, the board is absolutely fine. ECS is fine in general. They aren't as good as brands such as Gigabyte, but the $20 difference isn't worth it.
2015-08-16 22:30:41	mrtekn0	huh alright
2015-08-16 22:30:53	Yuken	speedysnorlax, by spending the $20, you can't fit in the 285, which just... isn't worth it, when I fit in better for the same price.
2015-08-16 22:30:59	Yuken	285 gets around 20FPS higher than  a270 on average.

2015-08-16 22:32:49	boa	just dont
2015-08-16 22:32:55	Yuken	boa, a 7950 is awesome. For like $99.
2015-08-16 22:32:59	Yuken	Anything higher, it just isn't worth it.

2015-08-16 22:33:24	Yuken	boa, yeah, a BLOWER 7950 isn't worth it at all, unless it is your only option.
2015-08-16 22:33:31	Yuken	jettakid22, are these part sbought yet?
2015-08-16 22:33:45	jettakid22	not the cooler just the cpu
2015-08-16 22:33:57	Yuken	jettakid22, you can use the stock one. But, I'd recommend a cheaper coolre.
2015-08-16 22:34:15	boa	but you can get a 280x for like 150
2015-08-16 22:34:15	Yuken	Water cooling isn't that much better than air coolers, for so much more (keep in mind, this is talking about AiOs, not custom loops)
2015-08-16 22:34:17	boa	so just buy that instead imo

2015-08-16 23:31:11	seednode	voila, pentium d
2015-08-16 23:31:16	boa	haha
2015-08-16 23:31:19	boa	i had a celeron for like 9 years
2015-08-16 23:31:20	boa	that was painful
2015-08-16 23:31:27	boa	i also ran windows me for 7 years
2015-08-16 23:31:28	Ispira	my CPUs: 
2015-08-16 23:31:32	TheKiwi	seednode, to be fair, core 2 quad was the same thing
2015-08-16 23:31:36	seednode	TheKiwi, yes
2015-08-16 23:31:38	seednode	But it wasn't netburst
2015-08-16 23:31:39	TheKiwi	two c2d stuck together
2015-08-16 23:31:41	TheKiwi	yes
2015-08-16 23:31:42	seednode	And netburst was precisely the issue
2015-08-16 23:31:45	«	porksandwich (~porksandw@c-73-132-243-247.hsd1.md.comcast.net) has quit (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
2015-08-16 23:31:47	boa	what about the 5960x
2015-08-16 23:31:52	boa	why is that cpu so bloddy expensive
2015-08-16 23:31:58	Wumbo	because they can charge the price
2015-08-16 23:32:07	boa	not like amd has antyhing in that tier
2015-08-16 23:32:11	seednode	Netburst = incredibly deep pipelines, rip energy efficiency, but high clocks
2015-08-16 23:32:14	seednode	So tape two together
2015-08-16 23:32:19	boa	scotch tape
2015-08-16 23:32:21	seednode	And you get power use like never seen before
2015-08-16 23:32:26	seednode	Whereas Core 2 was an actually sane arch
2015-08-16 23:32:30	boa	Wumbo, i notice the x99 cp us are fairly high tdp
2015-08-16 23:32:31	seednode	So the Core 2 Quad was fine
2015-08-16 23:32:35	TheKiwi	assburst
2015-08-16 23:32:36	boa	but at least the ihs is soldered
2015-08-16 23:32:40	Wumbo	not really
2015-08-16 23:32:44	boa	not really?
2015-08-16 23:32:49	boa	the higher tier are 150W~
2015-08-16 23:32:54	seednode	boa, AMD barely has anything to compete with the lower i7s, even at triple the TDP
2015-08-16 23:32:59	seednode	Much less higher
2015-08-16 23:33:00	boa	yea i know
2015-08-16 23:33:05	TheKiwi	 <seednode> boa, AMD barely has anything to compete
2015-08-16 23:33:06	boa	amd cpu department is crickets
2015-08-16 23:33:08	TheKiwi	fixed that for you
2015-08-16 23:33:16	seednode	boa, 5960X is 140W, isn't it?
2015-08-16 23:33:24	boa	i dunno, maybe
2015-08-16 23:33:25	seednode	And also, you know, adds two more cores, so understandable
2015-08-16 23:33:30	seednode	That's all of 10W over 4930k
2015-08-16 23:33:32	boa	2 cores from what
2015-08-16 23:33:33	seednode	For two more cores
2015-08-16 23:33:35	boa	oh
2015-08-16 23:33:35	seednode	Makes sense to me
2015-08-16 23:33:37	boa	ya
2015-08-16 23:33:42	boa	friend told me to buy that cpu
2015-08-16 23:33:44	boa	for gaming only
2015-08-16 23:33:45	boa	>mfw
2015-08-16 23:33:47	seednode	Still 100W less than an FX-9590 :)
2015-08-16 23:33:53	seednode	And more than double the performance
2015-08-16 23:34:01	boa	9590 is just a high binned 8350
2015-08-16 23:34:03	seednode	Yes
2015-08-16 23:34:11	boa	just buy a 8350 and oc it yourself
2015-08-16 23:34:14	seednode	But that doesn't affect my point in the slightest
2015-08-16 23:34:16	boa	not like it has any actual perf diff in gaming

2015-08-16 23:34:26	Ispira	Oh.
2015-08-16 23:34:27	boa	amd needs to learn how to do ipc
2015-08-16 23:34:31	boa	i hope zen suprises the tech world
2015-08-16 23:34:35	boa	but i know it wont
2015-08-16 23:34:38	seednode	Ispira, where the hell is your LGA2011
2015-08-16 23:34:43	Ispira	Between the core 2 duo and the t6400 I missed two: Athlon II X4 640, and athlon II x2 240
2015-08-16 23:34:52	boa	why would a normal person use x79/99 seednode 
2015-08-16 23:35:02	Ispira	seednode, never had the money for lga2011 :P and now it's useless for my needs really.
2015-08-16 23:35:03	seednode	Because epeen is all we care about here
2015-08-16 23:35:05	Ispira	I mean

2015-08-16 23:47:11	EdLin	JaNinja, irrelevant, it uses a different socket type than your CPU, so you'd have to throw away the whole motherboard anyway, and that CPU is worse than an i5 at the same price. You'll spend more this way.
2015-08-16 23:47:21	boa	i just dont recommend amd cpus in this age
2015-08-16 23:47:26	boa	the mobo is old as hell, and has no way to upgrade cpus
2015-08-16 23:47:35	boa	and 99% of am3+ mobos are pcie 2.0
2015-08-16 23:47:46	EdLin	yeah, the GPUs are fine, but AMD CPUs have no upgrade path and are not cost-effective once you get to decent ones.

2015-08-16 23:50:28	EdLin	JaNinja, oh, you already have it.... then you basically don't have a gaming system there until you replace the motherboard.

2015-08-17 00:05:52	EdLin	JaNinja, a build has to be ballanced.

2015-08-17 00:08:30	EdLin	JaNinja, my build will run most games at high or ultra, without stuttering. Your builds just don't make any sense.
2015-08-17 00:08:30	Codegeekman	how long does it take usually
2015-08-17 00:08:33	boa	depends
2015-08-17 00:08:39	boa	anywhere from 20 minutes to 5 hrs
2015-08-17 00:08:46	Codegeekman	im gonna say 5 hrs

2015-08-17 00:09:53	stormscape	plus if you do it on a table you gotta stand up all the time to put shit in
2015-08-17 00:10:03	EdLin	JaNinja, 700 is not a good price for a 2011 pair of graphics card and a CPU that needs third party coolers to work right.

2015-08-17 01:31:52	squintskii	but i KNEW i saw one

2015-08-17 01:38:18	squintskii	Wumbo, they were trying to remove any and all gpu limitations that could skew the results
2015-08-17 01:38:23	squintskii	its a valid test
2015-08-17 01:38:23	Wumbo	skylake on ddr4 1866 actually loses to haswell sometimes

2015-08-17 01:38:39	Wumbo	and when it does win, the difference isnt worth the price hike
2015-08-17 01:38:49	ZeDestructor	of course you seegains at 640x480, because at 640x480 you're CPU limited
2015-08-17 01:38:49	NeverSummer	I assume so, but I guess it's possible that some stuff could have gone missing.  Like I said though I used Carbon Copy to clone a drive before and everything made it just fine.
2015-08-17 01:38:51	squintskii	ZeDestructor, testing at 640x480 is the only way to test JUST the cpu performance

2015-08-17 01:39:44	ZeDestructor	and?
2015-08-17 01:39:49	squintskii	compare DDR4 to DDR4 and then you have a point
2015-08-17 01:39:51	ZeDestructor	DDR3 vs DDR4 menas diddly and squat
2015-08-17 01:40:05	Wumbo	ddr4 to ddr4 is pretty much the same as a ddr3 to ddr3 comparison
2015-08-17 01:40:11	squintskii	ZeDestructor, and show me an article comparing 2133 to 2800+
2015-08-17 01:40:18	Wumbo	it's like ddr3 1600 vs 2400
2015-08-17 01:40:24	ZeDestructor	once AT pushes their out, I will squintskii, I so will
2015-08-17 01:40:30	Wumbo	same shit as ddr4 2133 vs 2800

2015-08-17 16:21:44	thescatman	for the price of a 610 new you could probably get something like a 650/560ti/640 used

2015-08-17 16:21:56	Shoe15	So is long division with algebra
2015-08-17 16:22:02	swift110	thescatman, what happened was that I got a mac pro from 2006 and the logicboard died so for a long time its monitor just sat being unused
2015-08-17 16:22:10	thescatman	I haven't heard the word surds in about 5 years
2015-08-17 16:22:18	capSAR	I just wonder if it would be awkward having two monitors with different refresh rates. I wouldnt be using them in the same application though

2015-08-17 20:52:43	leecherby	DevilDuck: are you planning on it?
2015-08-17 20:52:52	DevilDuck	yeah im planning on it
2015-08-17 20:52:56	DevilDuck	like christmas
2015-08-17 20:53:09	leecherby	ok but still the $400+ mobo won't give you an edge over a $150 mobo
2015-08-17 20:53:37	DevilDuck	i kinda just got this mobo for the atheistic
2015-08-17 20:53:38	leecherby	and if you get a built-in-wifi mobo that saves you extra $50
2015-08-17 20:53:40	DevilDuck	:/
2015-08-17 20:53:52	leecherby	you could literally fit 2x 980Ti in that budget right now (no money for decent monitor then tho)

2015-08-17 20:54:19	leecherby	if you played some stuff around
2015-08-17 20:54:27	leecherby	you could possibly fit 2x 980Ti and a nice monitor
2015-08-17 20:54:33	Durlag	leecherby if I'm going with a GTX970, would it be worth it to grab a quality 1440p Monitor? Like 144hz?
2015-08-17 20:54:41	leecherby	Durlag: YES
2015-08-17 20:54:47	leecherby	Durlag: 1440p 144hz tho
2015-08-17 20:54:52	leecherby	Durlag: depends on the games
2015-08-17 20:55:00	Durlag	Hmm
2015-08-17 20:55:07	leecherby	Durlag: CS:GO, rocket league, LoL, Dota, Hearthstone etc don't require much
2015-08-17 20:55:27	leecherby	Durlag: focus on IPS, then Hz or resolution
2015-08-17 20:55:34	Durlag	Fair enough, I am looking at Skyrim etc
2015-08-17 20:55:34	leecherby	Durlag: don't buy a shitty TN with high refresh rate etc
2015-08-17 20:55:43	leecherby	look at 1440p fps benchmarks for it
2015-08-17 20:55:55	leecherby	and isn't it capped at 60fps anyway?
2015-08-17 20:55:57	leecherby	(Skyrim I mean)
2015-08-17 20:56:09	Durlag	I have no idea, I am using a shitty laptop right now.

2015-08-18 10:56:05	CeesKaas	Laptop: Asus Zenbook UX305LA or Dell XPS 13 (2015) 9343-8451, any thoughts?
2015-08-18 10:56:06	Soulvaki	summertimefine, they were wrong.

2015-08-18 10:56:26	betrayx	but would be abused
2015-08-18 10:56:26	INFTP	squintskii do you know anything about how quiet the 390 is? and a 390x is just an overclocked 390, right? The msi is better than the triple fan asus strix?
2015-08-18 10:56:27	summertimefine	Soulvaki: they're wrong with most things hence why I'm here checking haha
2015-08-18 10:56:38	Wec	betrayx wouldn't if they made the required amount high enough
2015-08-18 10:56:39	squintskii	INFTP, the asus is a terrible card, get the msi
2015-08-18 10:56:50	squintskii	INFTP, the msi is no louder or quieter than a typical gtx 970
2015-08-18 10:56:57	betrayx	wec what would you say the amount would be
2015-08-18 10:57:02	Wec	500
2015-08-18 10:57:02	squintskii	except when you arent gaming the msi will make no noise whatsoever
2015-08-18 10:57:03	Soulvaki	Even my wife's older i5 Macbook games decently. [non-intensive of course]
2015-08-18 10:57:05	Nova28	Don't know why people like sus so much
2015-08-18 10:57:12	INFTP	Isn't there a passive fan 970 or something though?

2015-08-18 10:57:16	INFTP	I want as quiet as possible

2015-08-18 10:57:24	summertimefine	So basically for not intensive gaming the kinda standard is i5, 8gb ram?
2015-08-18 10:57:27	squintskii	the msi 390 has the same
2015-08-18 10:57:33	INFTP	Nova28 A$$us

2015-08-18 15:49:08	Kreiger	Which is the discussion regarding that video
2015-08-18 15:49:19	+DefunctProcess	psuuu: the 5930k has much higher single thread perfromance than the 5820, you dont need to worry about lanes unless you have an sli, which you dont, and even if you did you wouldnt need to worry with the 970
2015-08-18 15:49:40	betrayx	Kreiger: if you're using the rig primarily for gaming it's cool
2015-08-18 15:49:40	+DefunctProcess	psuuu: you'd be far better off going witha  6700k or even a 4790k, investing the savings into a 980ti
2015-08-18 15:49:40	Kreiger	The focus seems to be on the frame-time. Of course I don't have a TitanX, so I think my gains will be much lower than that video shows.

2015-08-18 15:50:14	psuuu	you'll be stuck on the platform for a few years anyhow most likely and DDR4 is just not hitting mainstream so future games are likely to take advantage of the extra memory bandwidth. Something current games are incapable of.
2015-08-18 15:50:15	Kreiger	betrayx, yeah, it's primarily gaming with multi-tasking. I'll be going from Bloomfield to this.

2015-08-18 16:07:44	shrimp	Rooted Android with stock ROMs are great
2015-08-18 16:07:53	NeverSummer	That's the best argument I've heard for why it doesn't matter.

2015-08-18 16:08:09	+nRRe	that's why i went with it.  instead of spending $250 on some android phone i'll replace in a year i decided to try out an iphone for once.  one time fee of $24....

2015-08-18 16:39:49	jdorje	each core can run two threads at once with no slowdown, that means the core doesn't have to stop while you swap in a thread

2015-08-18 16:40:29	jdorje	well, that's exactly what has changed that makes the g3258 no longer competitive with the i3

2015-08-18 16:41:12	jdorje	a modern game may have one single thread that is the bottleneck on an i5, but with dozens of secondary threads
2015-08-18 16:41:38	jdorje	if those all have to compete on the second core, and compete with your music player or other system tasks in the background, then they have to be moved to the main core
2015-08-18 16:41:49	jdorje	and then you lose a lot of your single core speed
2015-08-18 16:41:55	+DefunctProcess	the point is
2015-08-18 16:42:00	+DefunctProcess	you want 4 threads

2015-08-18 16:44:22	jdorje	cs:go will fully utilize the 2 cores, so almost anything else that is running will lower your fps significantly since the thread has to be swapped out and back in

2015-08-18 17:00:40	+DefunctProcess	the only hard rule im aware of is you put a comma after but or in places where you can take out the words in between the commas and still make a complete sentence

2015-08-18 18:17:34	NeverSummer	You need all kinds of other information to extract useful data from RPMs in a car.  What gear are you in, what ratio is it, displacement of the engine, radius of wheels, etc, etc?

2015-08-18 18:18:36	NeverSummer	And just like two Fords can't be compared Apples to Apples CPUs can't either.  You wouldn't say a Focus at 3000RPM and an F350 at the same have similar power.
2015-08-18 18:18:38	drunkjake	Actually, all you need to know for RPM is the rpm of the engine, and the your axle gearings, to find MPH
2015-08-18 18:19:04	NeverSummer	Yes the analogy falls apart eventually, but for CPUs you need a lot of information is the point.

2015-08-18 18:43:55	stormscape	lolis still legal

2015-08-18 18:44:38	m13b	hmmm
2015-08-18 18:44:39	+DefunctProcess	and thus cp would be anything under 12?

2015-08-19 21:06:02	Divr	Another question. I got a like $10 3 year extended replacement warranty on my last MOBO, and literally 3 years to the month it burned out. The store diagnosed it and replaced it same day, which was awesome. Is there any other part worth insuring, if it's basically $10 for 3 years on the part?

2015-08-19 21:12:42	TheGoose	What hardware would be best to use for compatbility?
2015-08-19 21:12:44	Touzel	yes
2015-08-19 21:12:45	NeverSummer	cpu1: Yeah but presumably he can get a monitor that looks the same but runs at 60Hz.
2015-08-19 21:12:50	cpu1	Touzel: I mean blacks are great harddrives.
2015-08-19 21:12:55	NeverSummer	cpu1: I would imagine that Asus makes a matching cheaper model.
2015-08-19 21:13:02	jdorje	if you are gaming at 1440 144 hz with new games, you want 980ti sli just for that

2015-08-20 11:22:20	+AnimalFarmPig	I'd much rather the 950 not need 6-pin, but it's not a total deal breaker for me. The 650 Ti needed 6-pin as well. What's a deal breaker for me is the size of the cards and cooler. I want it to look exactly like the reference 650 Ti and 750 Ti and have the same cooler. Only difference should be model number on the card.
2015-08-20 11:22:23	twitchytoes	But card is same as mine
2015-08-20 11:22:38	jmt-	i have some 140mm thin filters coming to fit the slot better and be less obtrusive
2015-08-20 11:22:57	twitchytoes	I will admit, the build looks damn nice.
2015-08-20 11:23:21	jmt-	looks better now
2015-08-20 11:23:30	twitchytoes	Mine looks terrible
2015-08-20 11:23:34	jmt-	ill update some pics once the other filters come in

2015-08-20 12:18:01	Invader_Zed	Craig from craigslist ? you get around bro
2015-08-20 12:18:19	squintskii	supergauntlet, don't worry, it falls apart when you enable msaa, as you would expect it to
2015-08-20 12:18:30	Invader_Zed	is there an STD you havent caught ?
2015-08-20 12:18:43	nova28	supergauntlet: texture/colour compression. It chokes on non-compressibles though
2015-08-20 12:18:54	nova28	Like certain older ssds
2015-08-20 12:18:58	squintskii	it chokes on MSAA too
2015-08-20 12:19:09	Sake	Jappeto , apparently the other beep was cuz i didnt have akeyboard plugged in , it now only does the post beep but still no display
2015-08-20 12:19:16	+Jappetto	okay
2015-08-20 12:19:21	squintskii	the R9 285/380 is a better choice in that market segment

2015-08-20 12:19:56	+Jappetto	what are you using

2016-01-09 14:10:03	Wec	Antranik yeah the Elite 130 is quite a good choice then, as it has plenty fo room for a long graphics card and has lots of mesh around it so you get good airflow

2016-01-09 14:14:36	+PhantomTaco	to see whether or not the 390x is hotter as a result of the higher active core count

2016-01-09 14:15:02	Wec	test_account it pushes 1080p and assumes the monitor will scale it to 1440p
2016-01-09 14:15:15	puppyfromhell	@Wec - As much as I can - I don't game much, 8 hrs/week. If I can play crazy mods on GTA 5 and latest games, I am golden. Ideally SLI, but will settle for less for a smaller form factor.
2016-01-09 14:15:40	szernex	ah right, I should also try if it works with the integrated GPU now
2016-01-09 14:17:01	Wec	puppyfromhell Nvidia 980 TI is pretty much your only option then, as the current high end AMD cards don't have HDMI 2.0

2016-01-09 15:31:21	LikeABox	amd apu ftw
2016-01-09 15:31:23	nick125	thnws: I would probably try whatever ASUS 802.11ac router fits in your price range and see if that helps. Something with better RF performance might be good enough to get you where you need, especially if you're getting some signal already
2016-01-09 15:31:32	atif089	im just sad because I didnt go to a party and came home early to test this thing

2016-01-09 15:32:05	nick125	thnws: if that doesn't work well enough, it might be worth trying a powerline adapter+AP combo for the basement

2016-01-09 15:33:08	atif089	Also I dont get heatsink with new processor right?
2016-01-09 15:33:22	nick125	thnws: another option would be a separate AP...maybe one of Ubiquiti's new UAP-AC-Lite/UAP-AC-LRs might do the trick. 
2016-01-09 15:33:26	atif089	I have to get is seperately
2016-01-09 15:33:38	LikeABox	usually you get a heatsink with CPUs
2016-01-09 15:33:52	LikeABox	unless OEM

2016-01-09 15:34:06	Yaiyan	Honestly, my 6700 doesn't feel a whole lot faster than my old Phenom 955
2016-01-09 15:34:08	szernex	now what was all the crap you'd want to disable in windows10?
2016-01-09 15:34:18	szernex	cortana, automatic updates, automatic reboot
2016-01-09 15:34:20	szernex	anything else?
2016-01-09 15:34:22	LikeABox	going into privacy settings
2016-01-09 15:34:28	LikeABox	and disable almost all of it
2016-01-09 15:34:32	szernex	okay
2016-01-09 15:35:09	LikeABox	I mean, I don't think it's gonna matter. MS will turn it back on or collect data as they please anyway.
2016-01-09 15:35:22	Yaiyan	Especially compared to the speed jump between my Phenom and Semprom :3
