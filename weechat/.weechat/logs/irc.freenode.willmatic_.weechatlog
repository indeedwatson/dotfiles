2016-02-16 21:33:15	willmatic_	i hope we will get a future scene like we did at the very beginning of BCS Season 1
2016-02-16 21:33:49	indeedwatson	refresh my memory cause i don't remember the first scene :/
2016-02-16 21:33:50	willmatic_	i remember on the series' website part of the tagline was "Shows the events before and after the days of Breaking Bad."
2016-02-16 21:33:54	willmatic_	oh ok ok
2016-02-16 21:34:39	willmatic_	so the very first scene in Saul (now with the name "Gene") managing a Cinnabon restaurant (basically like a Starbucks or Coffee shop) and the city he lives in is Omaha, Nebraska
2016-02-16 21:34:43	willmatic_	so the middle of USA
2016-02-16 21:35:17	indeedwatson	i barely remember that haha
2016-02-16 21:35:34	willmatic_	and it shows how he is miserable with his job and everyything. this all takes places after breaking bad. then it shows a scene where he sees a biker/thug guy give me a bad look and he thinks its someone coming after him but it turns out to be nothing
2016-02-16 21:35:52	willmatic_	then he goes home and watches his old Better Call Saul commercials he recoreded on video tapes and the series starts
2016-02-16 21:36:03	indeedwatson	ohh that i do remember
2016-02-16 21:36:11	willmatic_	yeah
2016-02-16 21:36:23	willmatic_	and he lives alone in this future scene
2016-02-16 21:36:35	indeedwatson	yeah little moments like that are nice
2016-02-16 21:36:57	indeedwatson	it's cool that they don't over rely on breaking bad tho, just a few nods
2016-02-16 21:37:13	indeedwatson	i was expecting it to be bad actually
2016-02-16 21:37:47	willmatic_	yeah same. it stands on its own for the most part.
2016-02-16 21:38:00	willmatic_	i thought the mike storyline with the crooked philadelphia cops was good
2016-02-16 21:38:31	indeedwatson	yeah Mike's always good
2016-02-16 21:39:03	indeedwatson	I'm not sure how I feel about the Chuck arc
2016-02-16 21:46:04	willmatic_	i dont remember. there was the senior home court case, and chuck made the decision not to hire Saul right? then what?
2016-02-16 21:46:21	willmatic_	and i remember Saul bought his own office and asked the lady to work with him.
2016-02-16 21:47:20	indeedwatson	he fucked him over by not allowing him to be part of the big firm, iirc
