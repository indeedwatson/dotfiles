2015-11-02 22:54:46	inddwtsn	and today i went to see 2 Bergman films downtown, nice theater and pretty cheap
2015-11-02 22:55:30	Uberdum	what's a bergman

2015-11-02 22:55:41	Uberdum	also that sounds awesome
2015-11-02 22:56:10	inddwtsn	swedish director
2015-11-02 22:56:27	inddwtsn	it was
2015-11-02 22:56:38	inddwtsn	i wish i had someone to go with tho
2015-11-02 22:58:42	Uberdum	lol find someone to go with
2015-11-02 22:58:45	Uberdum	you're a qtpi
2015-11-02 22:58:54	Uberdum	a qtgrill would be lucky to have you
2015-11-02 22:59:32	inddwtsn	a qtgrill who likes B&W european film from the 60's
2015-11-02 22:59:50	Uberdum	eh why does your qtgrill need to be into that shit
2015-11-02 22:59:59	Uberdum	you probably won't be into knitting or whatever
2015-11-02 23:00:08	Uberdum	and i prolly won't find a grill into judo
2015-11-02 23:00:16	Uberdum	it's good to have your own thing
2015-11-02 23:00:38	Uberdum	and then i'm sure most grills would watch a shit old movie with you once in a blue moon
2015-11-02 23:00:50	Uberdum	just like you'll knit with her once in a blue moon even if it's not your passion
2015-11-02 23:01:44	inddwtsn	because i wanted to go with someone
2015-11-02 23:02:01	Uberdum	every single time? nah
2015-11-02 23:02:08	Uberdum	you want someone to go with you sometimes
2015-11-02 23:02:14	Uberdum	which is a good compromise
2015-11-02 23:02:19	inddwtsn	yeah but, 2 movies in a row
2015-11-02 23:02:27	Uberdum	you don't want a copy of inddwtsn with tits and no beard
2015-11-02 23:02:30	Uberdum	that would blow
2015-11-02 23:02:36	Uberdum	i don't want a copy of uberdum
2015-11-02 23:02:45	inddwtsn	yeah, i don't want someone with no butt ;)
2015-11-02 23:03:47	Uberdum	haha you know what i mean
2015-11-02 23:03:54	Uberdum	and maybe you should do some skwatz
2015-11-02 23:04:15	inddwtsn	yeah but it would be nice to be able to discuss stuff
2015-11-02 23:04:20	inddwtsn	i should
2015-11-02 23:04:57	Uberdum	i feel you
2015-11-02 23:05:14	Uberdum	idk about you but i think a new grill is right around the corner for me
2015-11-02 23:05:18	Uberdum	everything is just in place
2015-11-02 23:05:24	inddwtsn	in part i don't go to a gym cause autism, in part cause i don't want a monthly investment
2015-11-02 23:05:27	Uberdum	i'm feeling good, looking good, etc
2015-11-02 23:05:43	Uberdum	it just feels inevitable
2015-11-02 23:05:54	Uberdum	even though i'll still probably not try very hard :P
2015-11-02 23:05:57	inddwtsn	you gotta do something for it to happen tho
2015-11-02 23:06:03	Uberdum	inddwtsn autism is no excuse
2015-11-02 23:06:14	Uberdum	lmao that's my conundrum
2015-11-02 23:07:16	Uberdum	also i'm in love with gabriella https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkGKQvc_PbM
2015-11-02 23:07:16		[ http://is.gd/cig48o ]

2015-11-02 23:12:13	inddwtsn	o
2015-11-02 23:12:19	inddwtsn	why did you choose dmt
2015-11-02 23:12:31	Uberdum	because acid sounds corrosive
2015-11-02 23:12:59	inddwtsn	im sure you could find a dmt nickname that sounds bad
2015-11-02 23:14:40	inddwtsn	did you do research?
2015-11-02 23:15:11	Uberdum	on what
2015-11-02 23:15:17	Uberdum	people don't die from dmt
2015-11-02 23:16:12	inddwtsn	you could have a bad trip
2015-11-02 23:16:39	Uberdum	ye but at least dmt trip is only 45 mins
2015-11-02 23:16:44	Uberdum	so bad trip isn't as long
2015-11-02 23:17:04	Uberdum	like i said, any psychadelic will probably give me a bad trip
2015-11-02 23:17:09	Uberdum	i'm paranoid af right now
2015-11-02 23:17:40	inddwtsn	>only 45 minutes
