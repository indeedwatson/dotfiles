2015-10-29 20:48:08	Carson	still a work in progress
2015-10-29 20:48:45	indeedwatson	looks good!
2015-10-29 20:49:22	Carson	thanks
2015-11-09 16:39:16	Carson	I'm not sure if you are aware of this 
2015-11-09 16:39:35	Carson	but I found your github directory by accident 
2015-11-09 16:40:06	Carson	and it has your WeeChat setup stuff, with the password and everything 
2015-11-09 16:40:30	Carson	idk if you can make it private, but I just wanted to make sure you were aware of this
2015-11-09 16:40:57	indeedwatson	i know you can find it but my actual password isn't GAY haha
2015-11-09 16:42:08	indeedwatson	i dont think any of the other info is very relevant 
2015-11-09 16:42:22	indeedwatson	but thanks, for a second i thought i forgot to mask the pass
2015-11-09 16:42:42	Carson	okay good
2015-11-09 16:42:43	Carson	lol
2015-11-09 16:43:22	indeedwatson	that file is a bit outdated anyway
2015-11-09 16:44:44	indeedwatson	it looks like you chose a good time to make that post
2015-11-09 16:44:58	Carson	yeah hopefully 
2015-11-09 16:45:19	Carson	it seems like a good day, because weekends on Reddit are slow
2015-11-09 16:45:28	Carson	and today is the first day back
2015-11-09 16:46:02	Carson	and hopefully will have longevity throughout the week
2015-11-09 16:46:37	indeedwatson	i always thought fridays were the most active
2015-11-09 16:46:43	indeedwatson	but im sure there's stats about that
2015-11-09 16:46:57	Carson	yeah I'd like to know actually 
2015-11-09 16:50:39	indeedwatson	http://www.redditlater.com/analysis/#/r/truefilm
2015-11-09 16:51:32	Carson	really Saturday?
2015-11-09 16:52:02	Carson	well at least we don't have much competition on Monday
2015-11-09 16:52:07	Carson	if that's the case
2015-11-09 16:52:24	indeedwatson	in a few months you should make another one
2015-11-09 16:52:32	indeedwatson	do we have any weekly threads in the sub btw?
2015-11-09 16:52:49	Carson	yeah I think What did you watch this week
2015-11-09 16:52:58	indeedwatson	you could try to get the mods to sneak in a link and a comment on that what did you watch this week thread
2015-11-09 16:53:07	Carson	and this is just top posts, not number of users reading / upvoting per day
2015-11-09 16:53:25	indeedwatson	true
2015-11-09 19:38:29	indeedwatson	looks like the newcomers are talking a lot to each other, thats great
2015-11-09 19:39:06	Carson	yeah it is 
2015-11-09 19:39:18	Carson	hoping that would happen more
2015-12-02 23:45:07	Carson	I'm thinking I might give you OP soon
2015-12-02 23:46:23	indeedwatson	really?
2015-12-02 23:47:23	Carson	yeah I'm not sure if I can put 2 ops up or not, but in a few weeks I should be getting really busy, and IRC will be less of a priority 
2015-12-02 23:47:47	Carson	and since you're always around, and have been for a while, you're the most deserving 
2015-12-02 23:48:59	indeedwatson	:D
2015-12-02 23:49:29	indeedwatson	i don't think many OPs are needed given the size but if you feel it'd be good just in case i'd be up for it
2015-12-02 23:50:27	Carson	yeah we haven't had any problems 
2015-12-02 23:50:47	Carson	but it's always good practice to have someone watchign 
2015-12-02 23:51:34	indeedwatson	it's probably a matter of time before we get a troll or something
2015-12-17 14:13:27	indeedwatson	what command did you use to op me
2015-12-17 14:17:18	indeedwatson	To give other users auto-operator status in your channel, they must first register their nickname. Once this is done, you can make them a standard auto-op by typing "/msg ChanServ access #channel add nickname 5". This will add the user to your channel's access list at level 5.
2015-12-17 16:03:55	Carson	hmm 
2015-12-17 16:04:16	Carson	sorry I was busy
2015-12-17 16:04:42	Carson	is your username registered?
2015-12-17 16:07:42	indeedwatson	yeah
