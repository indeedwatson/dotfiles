2016-03-06 23:54:09	homu	tfw the rubberized coating on my mouse is wearing off
2016-03-06 23:56:24	R0b0t1	yeah
2016-03-06 23:56:26	R0b0t1	tfw

2016-03-07 00:08:44	eric_	homu: tfw you think the steelseries sensei is metal but it's not and the coating wears off and it looks gross
2016-03-07 00:09:10	homu	a metal mouse would be nice
2016-03-07 00:09:24	homu	maybe a little cold though
2016-03-07 00:10:42	indeedwatson	plasticseries sensei doesn't have the same ring to it
2016-03-07 00:11:34	homu	steel might not be a good choice though, years of hand moisture would make it rust
2016-03-07 00:11:41	+LambdaComplex	stainless steel
2016-03-07 00:11:46	+LambdaComplex	or copper
2016-03-07 00:11:52	+LambdaComplex	verdigrisseries
2016-03-07 00:12:00	homu	aluminum imo
2016-03-07 00:16:12	+LambdaComplex	copper looks nicer
2016-03-07 00:19:36	homu	until it gets all old
2016-03-07 00:27:01		kbw has joined #rice
2016-03-07 00:27:13	+LambdaComplex	homu: verdigris?
2016-03-07 00:28:04	homu	that'd be shitty on a mouse
2016-03-07 00:28:55	+LambdaComplex	why
2016-03-07 00:29:27	homu	it'd look ugly imo
2016-03-07 00:29:42	+LambdaComplex	i think it'd be neat
2016-03-07 00:30:19	+LambdaComplex	i'm pretty sure verdigris is a certified v a p o r w a v e color
2016-03-07 00:30:38	+LambdaComplex	along with cotton candy
2016-03-07 00:30:44	*	homu doesn't like blue, or green for that matter
2016-03-07 00:31:06	+LambdaComplex	but if it's both then they cancel out and you like it :^)
2016-03-07 00:31:14	homu	nnnnnnn
2016-03-07 00:31:27		fullsalvo has left #rice
2016-03-07 00:32:21	+LambdaComplex	did i make fullsalvo mad
2016-03-07 00:32:46	homu	extremely
2016-03-07 00:35:58	+codedwrench	lol okay, so the software i need for school works and is quick, but compiling a simple programming for the altera takes >10min
2016-03-07 00:36:00	+codedwrench	lol
2016-03-07 00:37:15	mikel	isn't it always slow as balls to compile for fpgas
2016-03-07 00:37:46	+codedwrench	yes, but this is on 2006 hardware
2016-03-07 00:37:51	+codedwrench	lol
2016-03-07 00:37:56	mikel	ah
2016-03-07 00:38:10	+codedwrench	it takes 1-2 min on my own laptop
2016-03-07 00:38:24	+codedwrench	i was curious how much worse it would be on this one
2016-03-07 00:38:26	homu	just get faster 2006 hardware
2016-03-07 00:38:45	mikel	it's funny, our university's compute cluster uses super slow amd opterons
2016-03-07 00:39:14	mikel	you need to be using a full 140W 8 core node to be faster than calculating directly on a modern laptop
2016-03-07 00:39:53	+codedwrench	lol
2016-03-07 00:40:34	homu	for single-thread performance, my 12" tablet is the fastest thing i own
2016-03-07 00:41:37	+codedwrench	 https://a.pste.pw/K8b.png 
2016-03-07 00:41:44	+codedwrench	lower right corner is compile time
2016-03-07 00:42:08	homu	that's a lot
2016-03-07 00:42:34	+codedwrench	yep, still that the program ran and compiled
2016-03-07 00:42:43	+codedwrench	i'm genuinely impressed
2016-03-07 00:43:42	+codedwrench	but if you want to get any serious work done with fpgas on this thing you better not make any programming errors :O
2016-03-07 00:44:06	+codedwrench	oh srry i got to wait another 10 minutes, i forgot a semicolon
2016-03-07 00:44:28	homu	sounds like a good excuse to get snacks
2016-03-07 00:44:39	mikel	sounds a lot like building in c++
2016-03-07 00:45:01	+codedwrench	the 1 minute my current laptop takes is pretty crappy already imo
2016-03-07 00:45:25	+codedwrench	but still, could be even worse
2016-03-07 00:45:50	homu	i compiled a thing on a raspberry pi once
2016-03-07 00:45:51	homu	it was awful
2016-03-07 00:46:06	+codedwrench	i ran gentoo on my pi for a little while
2016-03-07 00:46:24	+codedwrench	even with buildcc, fuck no
2016-03-07 00:46:32	@Tomoko_A_Best	night rice
2016-03-07 00:46:35	+codedwrench	or what is the buildserver thing called
2016-03-07 00:51:34	+LambdaComplex	i wonder how long compiling iceweasel will take me
2016-03-07 00:52:39	winny	forever
2016-03-07 00:53:08	mikel	like actually forever
2016-03-07 00:53:15	mikel	even more forever if you enable PGO

2016-03-07 00:55:00	+LambdaComplex	idk, last time it only took like 15 minutes i think
2016-03-07 00:55:10	+LambdaComplex	and i just set -j in makepkg.conf
2016-03-07 01:01:44	ajimu	.seen array

2016-03-07 01:02:21	ajimu	oh hey brushy 
2016-03-07 01:02:26	ajimu	how've you been?
2016-03-07 01:02:47	brushy	I've been okay, just woke up
2016-03-07 01:02:52	brushy	how about you?
2016-03-07 01:03:01	ajimu	ups and downs
2016-03-07 01:03:06	ajimu	pretty good this week
