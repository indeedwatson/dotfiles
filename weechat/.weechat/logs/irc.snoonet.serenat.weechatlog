2015-10-22 22:00:48	SerenaT	did i just step in the middle of.. stuff? :(
2015-10-22 22:00:54	SerenaT	wanna give me the play by play?
2015-10-22 22:00:59	inddwtsn	heh
2015-10-22 22:01:09	inddwtsn	yeah cummisar complaining about m092 being a dick
2015-10-22 22:01:29	SerenaT	i saw your very good point about ops and admins
2015-10-22 22:01:34	SerenaT	it does suck though
2015-10-22 22:03:35	inddwtsn	yeah, ive had drama with them myself
2015-10-22 22:03:48	inddwtsn	mostly when they just start kicking
2015-10-22 22:03:53	SerenaT	:(
2015-10-22 22:03:57	SerenaT	i hate it when ops are like that
2015-10-22 22:04:22	inddwtsn	most people put up with it, i sometimes i speak up but i stay in the chan because of the other people
2015-10-22 22:04:32	inddwtsn	seems like cummisar just doesn't wanna deal with it
2015-10-22 22:05:01	inddwtsn	m092 isn't that bad imho because you can just /mute him and lately he's not as kick-happy as phi
2015-10-22 22:05:43	SerenaT	man
2015-10-22 22:05:46	SerenaT	op drama :(
2015-10-22 22:06:04	SerenaT	i used to hang out in a very famous channel on efnet that was like that a bit
2015-10-22 22:06:09	SerenaT	actually i still do i just don't talk much
2015-10-22 22:06:54	inddwtsn	yeah it sucks
2015-10-22 22:07:22	inddwtsn	cause like i say if you don't like someone you can just /mute them, but if they can kick you because you made a joke about them, then it's just lame
2015-10-22 22:07:37	SerenaT	yeah
2015-10-22 22:08:25	SerenaT	thanks for letting me know, it's good to know who not to push
2015-10-22 22:08:29	SerenaT	how are you otherwise?
2015-10-22 22:09:24	inddwtsn	you can be like me and push them anyway and then bitch when they kick you ;)
2015-10-22 22:09:38	inddwtsn	im pretty good, watching a documentary about films
2015-10-22 22:09:39	inddwtsn	you?
2015-10-22 22:10:10	SerenaT	i'm in the couch stretch, trying to figure if i want to watch something or read
2015-10-22 22:10:46	inddwtsn	i think i don't feel the couch stretch in the places im supposed to feel it
2015-10-22 22:11:02	SerenaT	it feels in the quad
2015-10-22 22:11:07	SerenaT	where is it supposed to feel?
2015-10-22 22:11:19	SerenaT	i imagine i start with the quad and move onto hip flexors as this gets stretched out
2015-10-22 22:11:46	inddwtsn	yeah antranik says he feels it in the hip flexor and psoas
2015-10-22 22:11:58	SerenaT	he's a lot more flexible than i am
2015-10-22 22:12:03	SerenaT	so i imagine that's true heh
2015-10-22 22:12:03	inddwtsn	but i only feel it in my quads
2015-10-22 22:12:13	SerenaT	how flexible are you?
2015-10-22 22:12:15	inddwtsn	and i rather do other poses for that
2015-10-22 22:12:18	inddwtsn	not very
2015-10-22 22:12:27	inddwtsn	i touched my toues for the first time only this year
2015-10-22 22:13:26	SerenaT	\o/
2015-10-22 22:13:30	SerenaT	my toes are like.... another galaxy
2015-10-22 22:13:39	inddwtsn	hahah
2015-10-22 22:13:43	inddwtsn	you can't touch them??
2015-10-22 22:13:51	SerenaT	well
2015-10-22 22:13:58	SerenaT	if i warm up well and stretch yes
2015-10-22 22:14:02	SerenaT	but like.. just cold, no
2015-10-22 22:14:03	inddwtsn	i did it almost accidentally
2015-10-22 22:14:12	inddwtsn	ahh that's like me basically
2015-10-22 22:14:16	inddwtsn	im gonna try now
2015-10-22 22:14:35	inddwtsn	i can, but that's about my limit
2015-10-22 22:14:44	inddwtsn	if i stretch i can get almost 1st knuckle to floor
2015-10-22 22:14:49	SerenaT	oh i figured out how to get the couch stretch to feel int he flexor
2015-10-22 22:14:57	SerenaT	you push your hips forward
2015-10-22 22:14:59	SerenaT	a bit
2015-10-22 22:15:22	inddwtsn	i tried that
2015-10-22 22:15:34	inddwtsn	i'll try it again now
2015-10-22 22:16:13	SerenaT	squeeze the glutes
2015-10-22 22:18:17	inddwtsn	im so tight :(
2015-10-22 22:18:43	SerenaT	hee
2015-10-22 22:19:07	SerenaT	i feel it in the quad in the beginning and then it's like the stretch moves up
2015-10-22 22:19:13	SerenaT	and then i can feel it in the hip flexor
2015-10-22 22:20:34	SerenaT	also
2015-10-22 22:20:44	SerenaT	instead of the proper down dog, i've been doing it on my bed
2015-10-22 22:21:05	SerenaT	and i get a really good stretch of the hamstrings and my neck gets a break
2015-10-22 22:21:28	inddwtsn	my bed is a mess right now 
2015-10-22 22:21:51	inddwtsn	next time i do antranik's yoga, im gonna replace downward dog with something else :p
2015-10-22 22:22:15	SerenaT	i should explain
2015-10-22 22:22:34	SerenaT	i do it like you'd do an against the wall down dog
2015-10-22 22:22:37	SerenaT	only i lean on my bed
2015-10-22 22:23:01	SerenaT	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8qTIcut5ew
2015-10-22 22:23:04		[ http://is.gd/MCs9W0 ]
2015-10-22 22:23:04	inddwtsn	you confused me more lol
2015-10-22 22:23:04	SerenaT	like that
2015-10-22 22:23:18	inddwtsn	ohh
2015-10-22 22:23:37	SerenaT	i'd gone off looking for that video
2015-10-22 22:23:56	inddwtsn	i never did that
2015-10-22 22:24:07	inddwtsn	i mean i probably have but not in place of downdog
2015-10-22 22:24:26	SerenaT	i wonder if can just do it several times a day
2015-10-22 22:24:36	SerenaT	it seems to do wonders for the back of my legs and my neck
2015-10-22 22:24:54	inddwtsn	i usually just do pike stretch stuff
2015-10-22 22:25:31	SerenaT	i have this worry that i'm hyperextending my knees
2015-10-22 22:25:40	inddwtsn	hmm
2015-10-22 22:25:48	inddwtsn	have you asked antranik about that?
2015-10-22 22:25:52	inddwtsn	or posted a pic?
2015-10-22 22:26:29	SerenaT	no pics, i just figure i'm so tight that it's gonna take time to work up to those
2015-10-22 22:26:59	SerenaT	i think all this working out has only made my muscles tighter if that makes sense at all
2015-10-22 22:27:08	SerenaT	i'm not sure what else to do but to stretch
2015-10-22 22:28:48	inddwtsn	i don't really have flexibility goals
2015-10-22 22:28:58	inddwtsn	i only stretch if i enjoy it or feel i need it
2015-10-22 22:29:08	inddwtsn	and pike just to get a good pike pushups
2015-10-22 22:29:22	SerenaT	what are your bwf goals?
2015-10-22 22:30:24	inddwtsn	freestanding HS, HSPU, FL (that's gonna take ages)
2015-10-22 22:30:40	SerenaT	what is FL?
2015-10-22 22:30:40	inddwtsn	i wanna get higher pullups volume too
2015-10-22 22:30:43	inddwtsn	front lever
2015-10-22 22:30:47	SerenaT	oh oh
2015-10-22 22:31:01	SerenaT	what was the first thing you were able to reach when you first started?
2015-10-22 22:31:19	inddwtsn	um i dont know, i was a fat blob
2015-10-22 22:31:32	inddwtsn	maybe bw squats
2015-10-22 22:31:49	SerenaT	what are you the most proud of?
2015-10-22 22:32:38	inddwtsn	that's a hard one cause im usually self deprecating 
2015-10-22 22:32:44	inddwtsn	maybe pike pushups
2015-10-22 22:33:04	inddwtsn	oh, and finger pulses
2015-10-22 22:33:09	inddwtsn	cause i can do more than antranik
2015-10-22 22:33:16	SerenaT	haha
2015-10-22 22:33:41	SerenaT	i just can't bend like that man
2015-10-22 22:33:48	SerenaT	everything is tight
2015-10-22 22:33:55	SerenaT	and i probably have too much belly
2015-10-22 22:34:58	inddwtsn	fingers to floor pike is good enough for pike pushups
2015-10-22 22:35:14	inddwtsn	strength is the hardest part of that exercise
2015-10-22 22:36:31	inddwtsn	how about your goals?
2015-10-22 22:36:34	SerenaT	hmm
2015-10-22 22:36:38	SerenaT	ill defined so far
2015-10-22 22:37:01	inddwtsn	any short term goal
2015-10-22 22:37:25	SerenaT	i have a really weak core from having carried my kids so close together
2015-10-22 22:37:52	inddwtsn	are you working on core stuff?
2015-10-22 22:37:52	SerenaT	so i'd really like to be able to do a pilates rollup
2015-10-22 22:37:58	SerenaT	yeah
2015-10-22 22:38:31	SerenaT	this past week, i could do a situp if i swung my arms and cheated a little
2015-10-22 22:38:32	inddwtsn	lemme google that
2015-10-22 22:40:03	inddwtsn	yeah i can do that
2015-10-22 22:40:13	inddwtsn	hollow body helps a lot with that
2015-10-22 22:40:17	inddwtsn	and leg raises
2015-10-22 22:40:30	SerenaT	i've got a freakishly strong back because it took over for a lot of core stuff
2015-10-22 22:40:47	SerenaT	what is hollow body? is it pressing your spine into the floor?
2015-10-22 22:41:10	inddwtsn	it's in the body line drills
2015-10-22 22:43:08	inddwtsn	you could start with arms down and knees bent
2015-10-22 22:44:41	inddwtsn	i do remember not being able to get up like that
2015-10-22 22:44:46	inddwtsn	but now it feels really easy
2015-10-22 22:45:08	inddwtsn	i think getting into plow pose helped too
2015-10-22 22:46:07	SerenaT	yeah
2015-10-22 22:46:17	SerenaT	i have gotten stronger, which is kind of amazing to me
2015-10-22 22:46:32	SerenaT	when i did yoga on tuesday, for the first time *ever* the down dog was a resting pose
2015-10-22 22:46:44	inddwtsn	nice
2015-10-22 22:46:50	inddwtsn	i don't think it's ever been for me haha
2015-10-22 22:47:23	SerenaT	it wouldn't be otherwise but she was working us pretty hard
2015-10-22 22:51:08	inddwtsn	i never went to a yoga class either
2015-10-22 22:52:22	SerenaT	i've mostly done youtube or dvds or what have you
2015-10-22 22:52:39	SerenaT	this lady at my gym is really good though and i've become a regular at her class
2015-10-22 22:53:12	inddwtsn	im scared i'll go to a class and they'll start talking about energy and chakras
2015-10-22 22:54:24	SerenaT	there is a little woo in this one but not as much as i was afraid
2015-10-22 22:55:16	SerenaT	mostly it's her gently getting me to stretch a little deeper
2015-10-22 22:55:49	SerenaT	i originally felt that the whole breath thing was kind of stupid but holding something for a breath and moving with the breath really seems helpful
2015-10-22 22:58:30	inddwtsn	yeah sometimes i struggle to follow breathing timing from videos
2015-10-22 22:59:20	SerenaT	my instructor says that this is one of her goals now
2015-10-22 22:59:31	SerenaT	to follow a yoga class with her breath all the way through
2015-10-22 23:00:18	inddwtsn	oh so even teachers have problems with that?
2015-10-22 23:00:40	SerenaT	she said that it's not automatic for her
2015-10-22 23:00:50	SerenaT	i don't know if that means that she's not as good at yoga or whatever
2015-10-22 23:01:02	SerenaT	also, this is at a gym not a yoga studio so grain of salt and all
2015-10-22 23:02:59	inddwtsn	i've never been to a gym either
2015-10-22 23:03:18	SerenaT	this is the only one i've felt comfortable with, ever
2015-10-22 23:03:28	SerenaT	very positive and accepting
2015-10-22 23:04:00	SerenaT	in my experience most are not but htis is a small privately owned place
2015-10-22 23:04:12	SerenaT	and the owner is there every day, the staff are like family
2015-10-22 23:04:32	inddwtsn	i gotta check some of my local gyms but im afraid they probably don't have proper weights for DL and squats
2015-10-22 23:04:39	inddwtsn	which is all i'd go for
2015-10-22 23:04:57	SerenaT	check them out and see
2015-10-22 23:04:58	inddwtsn	and it also feels kinda expensive to pay just to do those things a few times a week for like 30mins
2015-10-22 23:05:06	SerenaT	that's the downside
2015-10-22 23:05:13	SerenaT	if you feel you'll do on your own, just get a power rack
2015-10-22 23:05:22	SerenaT	but it's nice way to meet people and all
2015-10-22 23:06:05	inddwtsn	if i could afford it i would but weights
2015-10-22 23:06:28	inddwtsn	im not very social and i tend to assume i'd bother people if i talked to them
2015-10-22 23:06:29	SerenaT	understood
2015-10-22 23:06:33	inddwtsn	but it'd be nice to have a gym buddy
2015-10-22 23:06:33	SerenaT	psh
2015-10-22 23:07:14	inddwtsn	also i'd probably get distracted by girls :)
2015-10-22 23:07:35	SerenaT	ah yeah, the wimmin
2015-10-22 23:07:44	SerenaT	the dudes have been really supportive of me lifting
2015-10-22 23:07:52	SerenaT	like, the competition dudes too
2015-10-22 23:08:05	SerenaT	suprised the hell out of me
2015-10-22 23:08:25	SerenaT	they also appologize to me when i catch them practicing shirtless
2015-10-22 23:08:49	inddwtsn	haha
2015-10-22 23:09:24	inddwtsn	i'd probably have a crush on a regular girl and never talk to her
2015-10-22 23:09:54	SerenaT	never know
2015-10-22 23:10:00	SerenaT	maybe she's crushing on you too
2015-10-22 23:10:43	inddwtsn	i haven't even stepped into the gym and we're already making it into a romantic novel haha
2015-10-22 23:10:55	SerenaT	you're the one!
2015-10-22 23:11:06	SerenaT	i just continued it
2015-10-22 23:11:09	SerenaT	to a happy ending
2015-10-22 23:11:28	inddwtsn	true
2015-10-22 23:53:38	SerenaT	if you have netflix and like back to the future, the documentary that just came out is pretty good
2015-10-23 00:01:31	inddwtsn	i don't have netflix but i watch stuff by other means ;)
2015-10-23 00:01:36	inddwtsn	how long is it?
2015-10-23 00:01:45	SerenaT	hour and a halfish
2015-10-23 00:01:56	inddwtsn	cool
2015-10-23 00:02:03	SerenaT	and yeah, i don't use netflix myself, someone recommended it and i oculdn't resist
2015-10-23 00:02:13	SerenaT	(it's up on icefilms if that's what you use)
2015-10-23 00:02:51	inddwtsn	i use torrents mostly
2015-10-23 00:03:03	SerenaT	yeah
2015-10-23 00:03:16	inddwtsn	or if it's old movies or stuff that I don't care about image quality i just yt it
2015-10-23 00:03:27	inddwtsn	im watching a standup comedian rn

2015-10-23 00:05:39	SerenaT	i can't say that i'm familiar but i'll look into it

2015-10-23 00:10:09	inddwtsn	yeah, but there's not much of him
2015-10-23 00:10:15	inddwtsn	i guess cause he's young
2015-10-23 00:10:22	SerenaT	he doesn't do standup, really
2015-10-23 00:10:34	SerenaT	except for "what"

2015-10-23 00:13:56		[ http://is.gd/Cc488k ]
2015-10-23 00:14:07	SerenaT	she's got some other ones
2015-10-23 00:14:25	SerenaT	have you seen the hbo special "talking funny"?

2015-10-23 00:15:24	inddwtsn	do you like ricky gervais?
2015-10-23 00:15:31	SerenaT	i enjoy when they make each other laugh
2015-10-23 00:15:35	SerenaT	he's not my favorite
2015-10-23 00:15:57	inddwtsn	his standup isn't that good but he used to have a podcast that was great
2015-10-23 00:18:30	SerenaT	i find him to be a bit too.. sarcastic? something
2015-10-23 00:19:58	SerenaT	erin foley isn't too bad https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyWUFkVGAGg
2015-10-23 00:19:58		[ http://is.gd/apvnMn ]

2015-10-23 00:20:03	SerenaT	i try for the lady ones
2015-10-23 00:20:06	SerenaT	it's a girl thing
2015-10-23 00:20:38	inddwtsn	yeah i gotta admit i don't know many female standup comedians
2015-10-23 00:20:53	SerenaT	it's not that he's british, i watch a lto of those
2015-10-23 00:21:02	SerenaT	irish
2015-10-23 00:21:09	SerenaT	Dylan Moran is probably my favorite
2015-10-23 00:21:21	inddwtsn	i love dylan moran
2015-10-23 00:21:24	SerenaT	i can probably recite his stuff heh
2015-10-23 00:21:26	inddwtsn	have you seen black books?
2015-10-23 00:21:31	SerenaT	oh yeah
2015-10-23 00:21:38	SerenaT	Love that Manny
2015-10-23 00:21:50	inddwtsn	bill baley
2015-10-23 00:21:53	inddwtsn	he does some standup too
2015-10-23 00:21:55	SerenaT	he's got standup too
2015-10-23 00:21:56	SerenaT	yeah
2015-10-23 00:22:11	SerenaT	i've only recently looked for it but youtube's stuff is pooor quality :/
2015-10-23 00:22:17	SerenaT	like.. pops in the audio, very annoying
2015-10-23 00:22:36	SerenaT	the Mr. and I listen to standup when going to sleep so we go through a lot
2015-10-23 00:22:50	inddwtsn	nice
2015-10-23 00:22:52	SerenaT	you mentioned lady comedians - there aren't many and we discuss this a lot
2015-10-23 00:23:08	SerenaT	why is it so hard for a lady to do standup
2015-10-23 00:23:17	SerenaT	i've got my own theories
2015-10-23 00:24:08	SerenaT	my guilty pleasure is Katt Williams' It's Pimpin' Pimpin'
2015-10-23 00:24:16	inddwtsn	what's your theory?
2015-10-23 00:24:18	SerenaT	it's so positive overall
2015-10-23 00:25:05	SerenaT	that it has to do with quality - a lot of women make it into standup on looks and then their material sucks
2015-10-23 00:25:14	inddwtsn	christopher hitchens theory was that women don't need to be funny because they can just be attractive, whereas mean need to humor in order to attract 
2015-10-23 00:25:38	SerenaT	i never thought of it that way
2015-10-23 00:25:42	inddwtsn	that could be too
2015-10-23 00:26:14	SerenaT	it is a fact that a lot of standup women are beautiful
2015-10-23 00:26:23	inddwtsn	but it's weird that there are good comedic acresses
2015-10-23 00:26:39	inddwtsn	see, i don't know even the attractive ones :p
2015-10-23 00:26:55	SerenaT	i guess it just means that you have to be a human who's funny not just a beautiful woman
2015-10-23 00:27:13	SerenaT	i just realized that the ones I've linked are all what i'd consider beautiful but you judge for yourself
2015-10-23 00:27:24	SerenaT	dudes can get away with not being super handsome or whatever
2015-10-23 00:27:38	inddwtsn	they're not my type but i can see them considered attractive
2015-10-23 00:27:43	SerenaT	i cannot remember the guy's name, give me a sec
2015-10-23 00:27:57	inddwtsn	yeah sometimes being ugly can play in their favor
2015-10-23 00:28:09	SerenaT	billy gardell is a great example
2015-10-23 00:28:14	SerenaT	huge guy, super funny
2015-10-23 00:28:14	inddwtsn	Louie talks about that, how being young and attractive doesn't help get laughs
2015-10-23 00:28:30	SerenaT	but a woman ... unless she's attrctive she may not make it in standup
2015-10-23 00:28:43	SerenaT	i could be wrong
2015-10-23 00:28:45	SerenaT	i don't know
2015-10-23 00:28:53	SerenaT	informal opinions of internet strangers
2015-10-23 00:28:58	inddwtsn	i think i've seen him a few times
2015-10-23 00:29:21	SerenaT	i love billy gardell's standup, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MnSCAEIbsg
2015-10-23 00:29:22		[ http://is.gd/xfRTQ1 ]
2015-10-23 00:29:23	inddwtsn	yeah that could be part of the truth
2015-10-23 00:29:43	SerenaT	there are several bits out of that standup that have made it into my daily conversations
2015-10-23 00:29:56	SerenaT	expecially the bit where he talks about hurting his neck sleeping
