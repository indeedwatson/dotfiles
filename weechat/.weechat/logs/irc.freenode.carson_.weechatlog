2015-12-02 19:16:57	indeedwatson	i don't remember the details but at one point they were going to put melee into EVO, the most important fighting games even in the world
2015-12-02 19:17:08	indeedwatson	and like the day before, nintendo said they wouldn't allow it
2015-12-02 19:17:31	indeedwatson	and there was a huge backlash and nintento eventually had to give in
2015-12-02 19:17:47	Carson_	yeah come on nintendo seriously
2015-12-02 19:18:04	Carson_	they should be proud of their community 
2015-12-02 19:19:21	Carson_	and so do the later versions past melee not work well with competitive?
2015-12-02 19:19:28	Carson_	because they updated things?
2015-12-02 19:19:43	indeedwatson	brawl is the worst afaik because it encourages playing defensively
2015-12-02 19:19:48	indeedwatson	so it gets boring and slow
2015-12-02 19:19:57	indeedwatson	and the last one is a bit better but still not as good as melee
2015-12-02 19:20:32	indeedwatson	i've only played the first one, with friends
2015-12-02 19:39:35	Carson_	i've played them all
2015-12-02 19:39:48	indeedwatson	you have consoles?
2015-12-02 19:39:53	Carson_	Melee and Brawl the most
2015-12-02 19:39:55	Carson_	no I used to 
2015-12-02 19:40:02	Carson_	got rid of them all
2015-12-02 19:40:16	indeedwatson	and now you have a mac
2015-12-02 19:40:24	indeedwatson	so no more gaming?
2015-12-02 19:41:18	Carson_	I grew up with a NES and Sega Genesis, I've had a gameboy pocket, color, advance, advance SP, Nintendo 64, Wii, Ps1, Ps2, Ps3, PSP
2015-12-02 19:41:29	Carson_	and also a DS lite
2015-12-02 19:41:35	indeedwatson	hah
2015-12-02 19:41:39	Carson_	oh and Gamecube 
2015-12-02 19:41:47	indeedwatson	i just had nes, genesis, ps1 and 2
2015-12-02 19:41:52	indeedwatson	still have ps2 but doesn't work
2015-12-02 19:42:11	Carson_	it's funny to think about, that I've had these all, and now I have nothing 
2015-12-02 19:42:48	Carson_	just gave it all up to pursue better things in life
2015-12-02 19:43:03	Carson_	will only play videogames now with friends, and it costs me nothing
2015-12-02 19:43:06	Carson_	:)
2015-12-02 19:43:33	Carson_	better things meaning wasting time on youtube, internet, IRC :-(
2015-12-02 19:43:46	indeedwatson	i don't think i'd want to quit
2015-12-02 19:43:49	Carson_	I should be reading or watching films though, but I tend to procrastinate
2015-12-02 19:43:55	indeedwatson	it'd be like quitting movies or books
2015-12-02 19:44:17	Carson_	I'd like a PS4 to play with friends but I don't think my spouse would like it once we start living together
2015-12-02 19:45:17	indeedwatson	i'd want a ps4 to play like, 1 game
2015-12-02 19:45:35	indeedwatson	but i don't like that tactic of exclusives
2015-12-02 19:45:48	Carson_	what game?
2015-12-02 19:45:58	indeedwatson	bloodborne
2015-12-02 19:46:17	Carson_	jus a ps4, because all my friends have it and it's cheaper than the other consoles 
2015-12-02 19:46:18	indeedwatson	but i don't care anymore since i know dark souls 3 is coming out
2015-12-02 19:51:27	Carson_	i might want to play the last guardian 
2015-12-02 19:51:46	indeedwatson	oh yes that too :/
2015-12-02 19:51:54	indeedwatson	shadow of the colossus is one of my favorite ps2 games
2015-12-02 19:52:01	Carson_	same
2015-12-02 19:52:49	indeedwatson	that reminds me i should finish ICO
2015-12-02 19:52:54	indeedwatson	been playing it on emulator
2015-12-02 19:53:06	Carson_	regrettably, I also like playing online multiplayer FPS games 
2015-12-02 19:53:18	indeedwatson	...on console?
2015-12-02 19:53:23	Carson_	mainly for the competition and strategy
2015-12-02 19:53:28	Carson_	yes, but I don't play anymore 
2015-12-02 19:54:01	Carson_	unless it's with friends at their place 
2015-12-02 19:54:26	indeedwatson	playing fps on console is like watching apocalypse now in a cellphone screen :p
2015-12-02 19:54:34	Carson_	lol
2015-12-02 19:54:36	Carson_	it's true 
2015-12-02 19:54:38	Carson_	it is bad 
2015-12-02 19:54:47	Carson_	it's shameful
2015-12-02 19:54:48	indeedwatson	i don't play it but i love quake
2015-12-02 19:55:00	Carson_	Call of Duty and Battlefield 
2015-12-02 19:55:01	indeedwatson	same with csgo
2015-12-02 19:55:10	Carson_	really like the gametype called Search and Destroy
2015-12-02 19:55:14	indeedwatson	mostly i just love tf2 because of all the options it has
2015-12-02 19:55:56	indeedwatson	yeah i was never a fan of those games
2015-12-02 19:56:03	Carson_	heh I understand 
2015-12-02 19:56:06	Carson_	they are rough
2015-12-02 19:56:17	Carson_	Search and Destroy is so much fun to me though
2015-12-02 19:56:50	indeedwatson	what's that
2015-12-02 19:58:00	Carson_	it's like a 6 v 6, with an offense and defense 
2015-12-02 19:58:21	Carson_	1 life per round 
2015-12-02 19:58:53	Carson_	and offense needs to plant a bomb at 1 of 3 bomb sites 
2015-12-02 19:59:10	Carson_	defense needs to defends the bomb sites 
2015-12-02 19:59:26	Carson_	and you only have 5 minutes per round 
2015-12-02 19:59:31	Carson_	oh wait 
2015-12-02 19:59:40	Carson_	idk the time exactly 
2015-12-02 19:59:51	indeedwatson	sounds like csgo
2015-12-02 20:00:04	indeedwatson	that's their most played mode afaik
2015-12-02 20:00:23	Carson_	interesting 
2015-12-02 20:00:25	Carson_	didn't know that
2015-12-02 20:00:48	indeedwatson	i think its 5v5
2015-12-02 20:01:17	Carson_	it's so fun to play with a smart team too
2015-12-02 20:01:28	Carson_	thing is it isn't that popular on Call of Duty
2015-12-02 20:08:15	indeedwatson	CoD has a pretty bad reputation haha
2015-12-02 20:08:23	Carson_	it really does 
2015-12-02 20:08:27	Carson_	and I understand 
2015-12-02 20:08:48	Carson_	some of the maps and game types are very arcade like 
2015-12-02 20:09:04	Carson_	and the gameplay is filled with a lot of cheap tricks 
2015-12-02 20:09:37	indeedwatson	i think more than the game itself it's the annual releases and the community
2015-12-02 20:10:07	Carson_	yeah that's true 
2015-12-02 20:10:48	Carson_	really hating that they are incorporating this boost jump into the game, really makes it a bit more challenging 
2015-12-02 20:11:19	indeedwatson	how do you play it with friends? split screen?
2015-12-02 20:11:29	Carson_	in reality I think they should have a base game, and then just have new update packages each year 
2015-12-02 20:11:53	Carson_	he has two tvs and two consoles because he has a brother with one too
2015-12-02 20:12:02	indeedwatson	but you can't charge $60 for a package 
2015-12-02 20:12:11	Carson_	he's moving soon so i might have to do split screen which sucks 
2015-12-02 20:12:56	indeedwatson	yeah i can't imagine that
2015-12-02 20:13:11	indeedwatson	the only fps which is good with split screen is portal 2, and that barely counts as fps
2015-12-02 20:13:38	Carson_	his tv is so small it's impossible to see though
2015-12-02 20:14:07	indeedwatson	for that reason, i'd actually buy a wii u
2015-12-02 20:14:15	indeedwatson	for local party games
2015-12-02 20:14:17	Carson_	they could do 2 30 dollar packages twice a year 
2015-12-02 20:14:24	indeedwatson	or rather, i'd annoy a friend so he buys one
2015-12-02 20:14:38	Carson_	i gotta go, bee back later
2015-12-02 20:15:19	indeedwatson	alright
2015-12-02 20:15:22	indeedwatson	see ya
