2015-12-20 17:09:23	jakedgreene16	bridge to terabithia made me cry, but it wasn't a great film
2015-12-20 17:09:29	zantkin	I managed to enjoy it, but when I'm trying to be objective with it, I have to say it had a lot of faults
2015-12-20 17:09:34	lonelychainsaw	I hope the game of thrones game isnt as bad. I'll probably play it because I'm an GoT addict scrapping the bottom of the cookie jar for content.

2015-12-20 17:10:08	wabbl	i think the problem is your complaints may or may not be legitimate but your playthrough is mainly you insulting everything possible rather than even making an attempt to take it even remotely seriously

2015-12-20 17:10:51	labreya	Yeah, I really enjoyed The Walking Dead, and I felt the presentation was good. I completely disagree. I feel you're being overly harsh of a game you didn't like because of how the fans reacted to your opinion, not the games own merits.
