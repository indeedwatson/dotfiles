2015-12-21 14:01:41	MarkoStih	maybe
2016-03-04 18:31:39	MarkoStih	which one?
2016-03-04 18:31:53	MarkoStih	how many can you do now?
2016-03-04 18:32:01	yama	the one you told me that was great! that your friend was doing
2016-03-04 18:32:01	--	[MarkoStih] is away: Offline
2016-03-04 18:32:08	yama	i havent done them in months
2016-03-04 18:32:12	MarkoStih	oh he's currently on the road to l-sit pull ups :D
2016-03-04 18:32:18	yama	but just now i did 8 pullups and 6 chinups :(
2016-03-04 18:32:24	MarkoStih	that's good!
2016-03-04 18:32:37	yama	i think it was with pauses?
2016-03-04 18:32:54	MarkoStih	yes let me just quickly check his log
2016-03-04 18:33:18	yama	ty
2016-03-04 18:33:23	yama	how you been?
2016-03-04 18:38:05	MarkoStih	3x3x8s Neg + 3x30s chin hang
2016-03-04 18:38:05	MarkoStih	3x5x8s Neg + 3x30s chin hang
2016-03-04 18:38:05	MarkoStih	3x5x10s Neg + 4x30s chin hang -> x-x-x
2016-03-04 18:38:05	MarkoStih	3x5x10s Neg + 4x30s chin hang
2016-03-04 18:38:10	MarkoStih	this is what he did when he first started
2016-03-04 18:38:11	MarkoStih	so
2016-03-04 18:38:20	MarkoStih	3x3x8s Neg + 3x30s chin hang <-- this is one training day
2016-03-04 18:39:05	MarkoStih	then we went on to 5 sets of 3-3-2-2-1 for example but with 2-3s pauses at the top, really focusing on retraction
2016-03-04 18:39:18	yama	what's chin hang? hang with supinated grip?
2016-03-04 18:39:29	MarkoStih	yes at the top
2016-03-04 18:40:10	yama	this for someone who could do 8 pullups?
2016-03-04 18:40:12	yama	or less?
2016-03-04 18:40:52	MarkoStih	then after he got 5 pull ups, we went on to 8-8-8-8 with 2s at top, then after this, we went on to deadhang to active hang for 2s, then pull (out of an active hang, quite hard and it shows if you have rotator cuff problems/other upper back issues) to the top
2016-03-04 18:40:59	MarkoStih	no, i'm just telling you his program
2016-03-04 18:41:03	MarkoStih	so you can apply it to you
2016-03-04 18:41:10	yama	oh ok, sry, continue
2016-03-04 18:41:57	MarkoStih	basically I try to do the same stuff with everybody and mostly it works but there are certain times when people are just different and have different weak spots but i think everyone should do this thing. If i remember correctly one of your shoulders rolls forwards during l-sit pull ups
2016-03-04 18:43:03	MarkoStih	now we're at Tuck L-sit pull ups, currently 4-4-3-3, he could do more, but like I said they are insanely hard on the rotator cuff and you need to have strong scapular depression/retraction, so I demand perfection from them
2016-03-04 18:43:08	MarkoStih	then it's full l-sit pull ups
2016-03-04 18:43:25	MarkoStih	for example, i could do 25kg pull ups for 3 reps, but the deadhang to active hang for 2 s then pulling up... i couldn't do it with my own BW
2016-03-04 18:43:29	MarkoStih	i needed a resistance band
2016-03-04 18:43:45	MarkoStih	why? My left shoulder went out of depression and retraction and rolled forward
2016-03-04 18:44:00	MarkoStih	which also explains why my left shoulder was hurting durint fl attempts (tuck holds, dynamic pulls, whatever)
2016-03-04 18:44:05	MarkoStih	always rolling  forward
2016-03-04 18:44:08	yama	you couldn't do dh to active hang to pullup with normal body or with L?
2016-03-04 18:44:17	MarkoStih	normal body
2016-03-04 18:44:21	yama	huh
2016-03-04 18:44:27	yama	i should try that
2016-03-04 18:44:27	MarkoStih	i can now, but it still sometimes, when not warmed up
2016-03-04 18:44:30	MarkoStih	feels weird in my left shoulder
2016-03-04 18:44:33	MarkoStih	yes and record it from the behind
2016-03-04 18:44:35	MarkoStih	i have a video wait
2016-03-04 18:44:41	yama	im guessing the 2s pause is what fucks you up?
2016-03-04 18:45:06	MarkoStih	exactly, some small muscles (infraspinatus 99%) can't hold it together for that long
2016-03-04 18:45:18	MarkoStih	i have no idea which muscles though, some muscles in the rotator cuff
2016-03-04 18:45:24	yama	i shuold try it fresh
2016-03-04 18:45:27	MarkoStih	it's much, much better now
2016-03-04 18:45:31	MarkoStih	basically i can do it now
2016-03-04 18:45:31	yama	im almost done with my workout today
2016-03-04 18:45:44	MarkoStih	try it now :D
2016-03-04 18:45:45	MarkoStih	just one rep
2016-03-04 18:45:49	yama	im happy cause i got paralettes, doing pike pu with more rom
2016-03-04 18:45:51	yama	FINE
2016-03-04 18:45:52	yama	lol
2016-03-04 18:45:56	MarkoStih	it's this
2016-03-04 18:46:54	MarkoStih	i can do it with my own BW now and also tuck l-sit pull ups, it didn't take me that long to master it but i've also done
2016-03-04 18:47:00	MarkoStih	a shit ton of rehab work for my RC
2016-03-04 18:47:07	MarkoStih	and also basic retraction/depression strength
2016-03-04 18:47:07	MarkoStih	and also basic retraction/depression strength
2016-03-04 18:47:07	MarkoStih	and also basic retraction/depression strength
2016-03-04 18:47:07	MarkoStih	and also basic retraction/depression strength
2016-03-04 18:47:21	yama	that sounds like hotline miami music
2016-03-04 18:47:45	MarkoStih	idk what that music is hahahah

2016-03-04 18:49:22	yama	ok i did one but im tired as fuck, and it wasn't very high
2016-03-04 18:49:34	yama	i dont have a place to try or train human flag :/
2016-03-04 18:49:47	MarkoStih	what do you mean with high? Usually it's the bottom part that's hard
2016-03-04 18:49:55	MarkoStih	just the first 2-5cm pulling from the active hang
2016-03-04 18:50:05	MarkoStih	that wasn't the point watson!
2016-03-04 18:50:16	MarkoStih	you should be impressed and tell me how awesome  I am :D
2016-03-04 18:50:26	yama	i know, i could do that bit, but then i went for the full pullup and didnt get very high

2016-03-04 18:52:20	MarkoStih	i know due to the floor it looks like it's hard wood etc but it's just concrete and then this thin layer of cheap plastic carpet that you roll out
2016-03-04 18:52:22	MarkoStih	idk how to call it
2016-03-04 18:52:24	MarkoStih	yeah

2016-03-04 18:53:08	MarkoStih	yeah i wanted to send one to helgi but it would cost a lot
2016-03-04 18:53:15	MarkoStih	and it can't really be dissasembled
2016-03-04 18:53:26	MarkoStih	they're old and I think they would get hurt in the process
2016-03-04 18:53:28	yama	i imagine

2016-03-04 18:54:06	MarkoStih	to record yourself from the back
2016-03-04 18:54:09	MarkoStih	from time to time srsly
2016-03-04 18:54:19	MarkoStih	yeah I'm curious share it later please
2016-03-04 18:54:19	yama	yes i've been recording myself more lately
2016-03-04 18:54:27	MarkoStih	(y)
2016-03-04 18:54:28	MarkoStih	that's cool
2016-03-04 18:54:32	MarkoStih	ok man ttyl
2016-03-04 19:28:16		MarkoStih has quit (localhost.localdomain gmail.com)
2016-03-04 19:28:22		MarkoStih (100001317622847@facebook) is back on server
2016-03-05 04:28:51		MarkoStih has quit (localhost.localdomain gmail.com)
2016-03-05 04:29:50	--	irc: disconnected from server
2016-03-06 18:06:04	MarkoStih	yes
2016-03-06 18:06:07	MarkoStih	spanish words :D
2016-03-06 18:07:56	MarkoStih	looks kinda really low volume
2016-03-06 18:08:03	MarkoStih	idk what your goals are though
2016-03-06 18:08:59	MarkoStih	how is the FL going? The other day i tried to lower myself into an adv. tuck FL and it felt really easy after like 5 months of not doing FL work
2016-03-06 18:09:07	MarkoStih	no shoulder pain nothing. Can't wait to start working on it again
2016-03-06 18:09:27	MarkoStih	all that rehab etc paid off, all that pulling strength i gained paid off. Nice feeling
2016-03-06 18:10:06	MarkoStih	i like your routine but i would split the upper body strength portion into push/pull, ie. one day upper body pushing 2-3 exercises, one day upper body pulling 2-3 exercises, everything else stays the same
2016-03-06 18:10:12	MarkoStih	i'd prefer that probably for myself
2016-03-06 18:25:58	MarkoStih	wow that's long yeah
2016-03-06 18:26:00	MarkoStih	this is my current routine wait
2016-03-06 18:27:15	MarkoStih	i'm currently on week 6, finished first leg day of week 6 today so tomorrow is rest, then push, pull and legs and rest again
2016-03-06 18:27:18	MarkoStih	and week 7
2016-03-06 18:27:24	MarkoStih	just so you're oriented more
2016-03-06 18:28:07	MarkoStih	it takes me around
2016-03-06 18:28:27	MarkoStih	1:40 hours to 2hours depending on the day (first leg day takes around 2 hours and a half sometimes)
2016-03-06 18:28:38	MarkoStih	it's pretty high volume/high intensity
2016-03-06 18:31:15	yama	cuban rotations at the end?
2016-03-06 18:31:15	--	[MarkoStih] is away: Offline
2016-03-06 18:31:19	yama	i thought they were good for warmup
2016-03-06 18:31:29	MarkoStih	meh, they are, too
2016-03-06 18:31:41	MarkoStih	i prefer doing them at the end
2016-03-06 18:31:58	yama	you don't warmup?
2016-03-06 18:32:01	MarkoStih	currently it's not cuban rotations, but db external rotations that i'm doing
2016-03-06 18:32:04	MarkoStih	oh yes,i  warm up a lot
2016-03-06 18:32:16	MarkoStih	shoulder dislocates sets upon sets, ido's shoulder routine
2016-03-06 18:32:21	MarkoStih	on leg days agile 8, foam rolling
2016-03-06 18:32:25	MarkoStih	my warm ups take me 20 minutes or so
2016-03-06 18:32:36	MarkoStih	idk why i didn't write the warm up in this routine
2016-03-06 18:32:42	MarkoStih	it's currently going really, really good
2016-03-06 18:32:42	MarkoStih	it's currently going really, really good
2016-03-06 18:32:42	MarkoStih	it's currently going really, really good
2016-03-06 18:32:50	MarkoStih	everything is going up... dips, pull ups, squats, deads
2016-03-06 18:33:06	MarkoStih	had to reset deads to fix my form
2016-03-06 18:35:21	MarkoStih	i just hope i'll get a wall assisted HeSPU soon
2016-03-06 18:38:13	MarkoStih	yeah i tried it the other day it's insanely easy like 50%
2016-03-06 18:38:17	MarkoStih	i was just pumping them out
2016-03-06 18:38:22	MarkoStih	but nose to grund is a different story
2016-03-06 18:38:32	MarkoStih	really really hard
2016-03-06 18:38:36	MarkoStih	i feel i'll get it though, hope so
2016-03-06 18:38:50	MarkoStih	pike PU on par. are a good idea and i'll do them too
2016-03-06 18:38:57	MarkoStih	just not right now, but i'll do a 4-8 week cycle probably or so
2016-03-06 18:42:22	MarkoStih	you hurt it with hespu?
2016-03-06 18:42:53	MarkoStih	may be yeah
2016-03-06 18:42:57	MarkoStih	i injured my wrist once with planche work
2016-03-06 18:42:57	MarkoStih	i injured my wrist once with planche work
2016-03-06 18:42:59	MarkoStih	a year ago
2016-03-06 18:43:03	MarkoStih	it's cool now. Never felt it
2016-03-06 18:43:05	MarkoStih	i hope it stays that way
2016-03-06 18:43:08	MarkoStih	started learning the tuck planche
2016-03-06 18:43:59	MarkoStih	yeah they can fuck your wrists
2016-03-06 18:44:02	MarkoStih	leans are a good way to show people
2016-03-06 18:44:06	MarkoStih	"yo bro, take care of your wrists"
2016-03-06 18:44:10	MarkoStih	because people don't want to
2016-03-06 18:44:46	MarkoStih	ditto :D
2016-03-06 18:44:57	MarkoStih	and the same goes to one friend who already has a mountain of injuries lol
2016-03-06 18:45:06	MarkoStih	started training with me 8 months ago, much better now
2016-03-06 18:45:07	MarkoStih	but meh
2016-03-06 18:45:27	MarkoStih	tendonitis, shoulder impingement, knee pain (from just BW lunges and squats)...
2016-03-06 18:45:41	MarkoStih	people need to realize prehab is important and safe form (there is no right form) will take you
2016-03-06 18:45:41	MarkoStih	FAAAR
2016-03-06 18:46:51	MarkoStih	i tried HS on paraletes, feels much better to balance it and also
2016-03-06 18:46:57	MarkoStih	open shoulders are easier to achieve
2016-03-06 19:44:24	yama	i managed to do hs on paralettes
2016-03-06 19:44:28	yama	coming down is scary
2016-03-06 19:54:25	MarkoStih	Its the same for me
2016-03-06 19:54:33	MarkoStih	i pitoutte out of it or how its called
2016-03-06 19:54:44	MarkoStih	it is a bit scarrier at first but fuck it :F
2016-03-06 19:54:46	MarkoStih	:D
2016-03-06 19:54:54	MarkoStih	Piroutte*
2016-03-06 19:55:02	yama	it's a bit more distance, and i alway fall with the same foot first
