2015-11-22 14:29:11	oGoshi	i'm sure there's something that fits your interests well
2015-11-22 14:29:16	inddwtsn	because i only care about myself i guess lol

2015-11-22 14:35:48	inddwtsn	i should try it again
2015-11-22 14:36:16	oGoshi	try what again
2015-11-22 14:36:21	oGoshi	gay sex?
2015-11-22 14:36:30	inddwtsn	i remember like a year back i was doing a course from.. harvard i think, called cs50, but i gave up cause they made you install a linux vm and i kept fucking it up
2015-11-22 14:36:32	inddwtsn	ye
2015-11-22 14:36:35	inddwtsn	and programming too
2015-11-22 14:36:58	oGoshi	well there are tech jobs outside of programming
2015-11-22 14:37:16	oGoshi	server administration, linux administration, networking, it, idk
2015-11-22 14:38:04	inddwtsn	yeah but that's the kind of thing that does not sound fun at all
2015-11-22 14:38:27	inddwtsn	it's sort of what my friends do but on windows
2015-11-22 14:38:47	oGoshi	what exactly do you enjoy
2015-11-22 14:38:56	oGoshi	what's spurring you to learn vim

2015-11-22 14:39:16	oGoshi	etc

2015-11-22 14:41:46	inddwtsn	making it look prettier
2015-11-22 14:42:02	inddwtsn	and i just learn a few vim commands editing the config files
2015-11-22 14:42:04	oGoshi	yeah i don't know all the tech subfields to place you well
2015-11-22 14:42:18	oGoshi	but i feel like there's definitely a job taylor made for your interests
2015-11-22 14:42:41	oGoshi	maybe even just a ux designer
2015-11-22 14:43:50	inddwtsn	i wouldn't know where to start
2015-11-22 14:45:13	oGoshi	coursera/udacity/edx/mit online are usually good starting points
2015-11-22 14:45:21	oGoshi	that's where i'm doing my statistics learning
2015-11-22 14:45:38	oGoshi	at least where i've started
