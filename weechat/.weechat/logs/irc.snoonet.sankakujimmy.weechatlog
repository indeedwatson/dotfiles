2015-11-27 19:37:46	inddwtsn	i couldn't figure out how to update a file that i modified on my pc and upload the changes to git
2015-11-27 19:37:59	inddwtsn	i thought i did, but when i checked the file in the git site it was unchanged
2015-11-27 19:38:53	sankakujimmy	go to the project directory and run a git status and look at what it says
2015-11-27 19:39:20	sankakujimmy	either there will be an unadded file, uncommitted file, or you'll be ahead of the master branch
2015-11-27 19:39:36	inddwtsn	it said everything updated
2015-11-27 19:39:39	inddwtsn	or synced
2015-11-27 19:39:44	inddwtsn	i can't check now
2015-11-27 19:40:09	sankakujimmy	ah dunno then, feel free to check the status and shoot it over to me and i'll take a look
