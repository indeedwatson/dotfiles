2015-08-14 16:20:43	peetaur	awkwardtechdude: it's mostly subjective.... for boot you want something like 256 MB minimum, or more if you do custom kernels (I usually do 1GB). for root you want at least 32GB for a desktop I think, and then /home depends on how you use it... and you can just combine that with / if you want, or combine /boot too.

The question is: What distro would provide me the most experience so I could
2015-08-14 17:34:18	DSee	use it towards my professional life? I've used: Arch, Gentoo, Slackware, Connectiva, Debian, Red Hat (old days), and many others... Just want something balanced... That will be good for desktop usage, and also give me experience to use at work. Suggestions?

2016-03-08 19:56:09	rattking	I *think* the reason you partition the device then create the raid array on the partitions is so that you can make them slightly smaller, this helps when finding a replacement drive

2016-03-08 19:58:34	acovrig	I’ll experiment myself virtually, but can I, in theory, plan for RAID-5 (mdadm) but start w/1 drive, copy data to it, then add drives later to give me parity?
2016-03-08 19:58:42	lucysan	well, no need to restore really

2016-03-08 20:00:25	lucysan	that would make sense
2016-03-08 20:00:43	acovrig	OK, I’ll probably be back on here once I get my virtual env setup to test with

2016-03-08 20:50:47	mnrmnaugh	how do search for that???? O_O
2016-03-08 20:50:56	staticsn0w	? starts and ends a character, for each ! its a different character, and -, +. and -+ are stuff that differentiate the char type
2016-03-08 20:51:05	phogg	mnrmnaugh: google understands +"!" (or it used to)
2016-03-08 20:51:15	c0fe	Cymage: what distro do you prefer the most?
2016-03-08 20:51:26	*	mnrmnaugh bahs
2016-03-08 20:51:27	phogg	staticsn0w: not interested unless you're planning to write a perl6 grammar for it
2016-03-08 20:51:32	Cymage	c0fe : depends on what i am doing
2016-03-08 20:51:33	humbot	brainf**k has only 8 instructions and at least you can make things with it
2016-03-08 20:51:41	c0fe	Cymage: everyday work
2016-03-08 20:51:45	staticsn0w	- for numbers, + for caps, -+ for characters like ~. ;, :, ", etc, and nothing for lowercase
2016-03-08 20:51:52	c0fe	is humbot really human?
2016-03-08 20:51:56	phogg	INTERCAL has more than 8 but it's harder to make anything
2016-03-08 20:52:13	humbot	hoo man
2016-03-08 20:52:20	staticsn0w	c0fe just a figment of your imaginaaaaashhuuuuunnnnn
2016-03-08 20:52:26	mnrmnaugh	eugh, nothing for numbers - for lower + fir upper
2016-03-08 20:52:32	neoncortex	it sounds like when me and some friends, when teenagers start to smoke marijuana and then, we say: "let's paint something", and then we paint, years later we found the paintings, and no known object of this world can be identified in the paintings o.O
2016-03-08 20:52:36	Cymage	c0fe : for servers,  centos,  for everyday i prefer Sabayon.  I have been known to direct people towards Fedora if I thought it would fit their needs
2016-03-08 20:52:47	mnrmnaugh	easier to remember
2016-03-08 20:52:49	staticsn0w	mnrmnaugh any programming language needs numbers
2016-03-08 20:52:51	c0fe	Cymage: why centos and not debian?
2016-03-08 20:52:57	neoncortex	maybe we can identify if we smoke and see it
2016-03-08 20:53:04	Cymage	c0fe : preference
2016-03-08 20:53:13	phogg	Cymage: masochist

2016-03-08 20:54:11	staticsn0w	yeah
2016-03-08 20:54:18	phogg	Building toy languages if fun, but only if you're writing the compiler. Using them tends not to be fun.

2016-03-08 20:55:08	c0fe	staticsn0w: so use ¿ instead of ?
2016-03-08 20:55:12	phogg	Rawriful: DSL's are not the same thing as toy languages.
2016-03-08 20:55:19	Cymage	c0fe : it is just an overall preference.  no particular reasons.  i just prefer centos
2016-03-08 20:55:21	staticsn0w	phogg to make a standalone version of !!!Batch
2016-03-08 20:55:37	staticsn0w	OH, I almost forgot, ?+? is the space key
2016-03-08 20:55:41	c0fe	Cymage: i see
2016-03-08 20:55:53	phogg	Rawriful: a toy is a complete language without a purpose, a DSL is usually an incomplete language with a specific purpose
2016-03-08 20:55:54	Rawriful	phogg: in my mind they are. You get garbled error messages and half the time it's just hacking the syntax of a lang.
2016-03-08 20:56:21	phogg	Rawriful: sometimes it's a good way to go. Think e.g. bind config files, a useful DSL
2016-03-08 20:56:21	mistermocha	is there a bash-friendly way to urlencode strings? That, or is there a reason why --data-urlencode wouldn't encode a particular string?
2016-03-08 20:56:52	c0fe	staticsn0w: or use these symbols for your language: ▣▤▥ ▦▩
2016-03-08 20:56:54	c0fe	yeah use those
2016-03-08 20:57:00	staticsn0w	c0fe hell nah
2016-03-08 20:57:15	auscompgeek	c0fe: what, are we rewriting emojicode?
2016-03-08 20:57:15	staticsn0w	next language, a chicken clone called c0fe lmao
2016-03-08 20:57:18	mnrmnaugh	mmm symbols. maybe not those though lol
2016-03-08 20:57:19	Rawriful	phogg: I see the merit. I just fucking hate it when it doesn't work and you don't know why and you have to grok some dudes poorly implemented dsl that spans multiple files when in all reality all you did was forget to add a param or something dumb.
2016-03-08 20:57:27	phogg	Rawriful: there is a dividing line between complexity/completeness and usefulness. When your DSL starts to become a general purpose scripting language it's time to rethink what you're doing. Toy languages, though, are meant to be general purpose, but aren't really better than anything existing for anything specific.

2016-03-08 20:59:01	Rawriful	phogg: I haven't had the benefit of using perl, so perhaps that one experience has massively soured my opinion
2016-03-08 20:59:05	phogg	Rawriful: yahoo famously used a DSL written in lisp for all of its templating, back in the 90s. It's not a bad idea, but it can become a nightmare.

2016-03-08 21:39:14	alankila	I think RSA strength is basically related to the number of unique primes that exist on the key lengths being considered, e.g. 2048 bit RSA has something like 2^128 primes you need to consider to find either prime of the modulus

Then you completely take the keyboard interface for granted and wouldn't have it any other way as any other way is going to be slower even if it were speech to text.  Like the only thing that slows me down in chatting through text is the composition.

Then it was happening in debian around the same version I remember it eventually quit happening after the kernel went up a few versions.  So I was left with the conclusion it was a certain version (probably some regression that made it into that version and was eventually fixed).

2016-03-09 23:04:16	n-iCe	Downloaded ir in my Phone
2016-03-09 23:04:17	pingfloyd	may be the same result with tee -a but worth a try

2016-03-09 23:04:26	tejasmanohar	i wasn't using the -a flag. thought appending just meant it'll add to the file vs overwrite but apparently it means it'll write to the file live
2016-03-09 23:04:27	tejasmanohar	thanks pingfloyd
2016-03-09 23:04:32	pingfloyd	tejasmanohar: did that work?

2016-03-10 13:51:54	Dandels	Madrix999, Antegros is probably the closest and best you'll get. I warmly suggest doing the command line installation, though. Either you've done it before and you should be familiar doing it again (the only part that requires reading up on is usually just how to LVM and possibly luks/veracrypt + LVM), or then you probably ought to install over command line just to get familiar with it in the first place

2016-03-10 17:12:11	Cymage	now,  according to the DoD, writing every byte on the hdd with random characters 7 times over will effectively wipe the drive.  in reality one pass writing it with zeros is enough to prevent almost all but microscopic data recovery.  microscopic recovery is so expensive and usually results in such fragmented info,  that it isnt even worth it
2016-03-10 17:12:19	latch	and the ease of wiping was just basically losing the key
2016-03-10 17:12:24	alankila	tulphoon: on the contrary, they are very easy to wipe -- even a single overwrite is likely a complete wipe
2016-03-10 17:12:30	megaTherion	tulphoon: not really hard to write
2016-03-10 17:12:31	megaTherion	eh wipe

2016-03-10 17:13:01	bratchley	Cymage: isn't that based on the idea that all data recovery technology is public knowledge?
2016-03-10 17:13:01	tulphoon	:3
2016-03-10 17:13:09	[nomad]	the best way to "hide" data is to erase/write null data to the hd for like a month 24/7 => microwave that drive / dismantle / burn / liquid azote / beak it apart  and even that theres still might  still data which can be recovered

2016-03-10 17:13:29	alankila	latch: encryption also defeats drive-internal compression and deduplication though, should be net loss in terms of drive longevity.

I'd like to set up a LUKS container on a remote system that I can then use to sync my data to. Does anyone know of a relatively cheap place I can get this kind of storage on? I'd need maybe 2TiB of space, maybe 1.5TiB.

2016-03-10 19:07:12	zerowaitstate	c0fe_machine: the way it works is there is "map" step that partitions your 100 craptons into 100 individual 1 crapton segments. each crapton is farmed out to a separate server where you do your processing. then there is a "reduce" step, where the results of processing your 100 individual craptons gets progressively merged until you have a single result

2016-03-10 21:30:20	BenderRodriguez	staticsn0w: There's a package manager for sublime
2016-03-10 21:30:32	BenderRodriguez	also, you can write your own macros, snippets, and plugins with python

2016-03-10 21:30:35	mnrmnaugh	what a silly example lol

I'm also not saying debian is perfect or faultless, you can get into the dependency hell with them, and that's never fun, it can require deep forensics to unravel what happened or even total reinstalls,

2016-03-11 22:04:41	kaiserA	Hello, I am running CentOS 32 bit as a server on a laptop, I set the suspend off in logind.conf as HandleLidSwitch=ignore is set, but still when I close it off it suspends, I already rebooted the system and this persists, is there another config file that might be over writhing this? This is extremely confusing as LidSwitchIgnoreInhibited=no is set, I am running without a DE so this shouldn't happen.

2016-03-11 23:22:16	denver	timotheusbooth: just look at debian documentation for configuring network interfaces

2016-03-11 23:23:40	c0fe	what is the point of selecting a user to be administrator if still requiring root to do various things?

2016-03-11 23:24:21	jim	timotheusbooth, if you have the dhcp client installed and you have the right stuff in /etc/network/interfaces, it should work fine

2016-03-12 10:27:49	pauliunas	anyway, i wanted to ask if there was a way to bind custom keys to GRUB. specifically, i want to dual-boot different distros, and also windows, on a tablet (acer iconia w700). it doesn't have a keyboard, but i would like to use the volume and "windows" (i guess you call it "super" here) to select the OS

2016-03-12 11:24:17	Psi-Jack	I mean, heck, it's literally almost better to simply mirror the various repositories directly into your own local repo, and then where needed, just have configuration management, like chef, install specific versions.

2016-03-12 12:50:16	Psi-Jack	The fact that the FBI is even using the judicial system in the first place to make their demands is already a back-handed manuever that will not be let to fly much longer the way they are going.
2016-03-12 12:50:44	Psi-Jack	Basically, at this point, it's literally the FBI trying to Compel Apple to do very bad things for everyone in the entire world. And that ... Ain't happening.

2016-03-12 12:53:03	Psi-Jack	What's even worse is the fact they're using the Lavabit situation, as if it related like ANYTHING to the situation at Apple.

2016-03-12 13:32:00	oquidave	hello, I would to make apache the owner of uploaded files from proftp. I've followed instructions from this how-to (http://www.codefx.biz/2012/01/proftpd-making-apache-owner-uploaded-files-directories). It's working with files, but the directories are failing to upload. It gives the error " root chmod(/public/dstXXccqYov) failed: Operation not permitted" in the log file. What can I do? Thanks

2016-03-12 13:50:26	MrPockets	On that NAS, was a datastore, with a large VMDK, formatted NTFS, attached to a windows 2k12r2 guest.
2016-03-12 13:50:57	MrPockets	At this point, all I really want running (or to have to manage at home) is a single CentOS box, but i'd like to serve the files on the NAS via samba.
2016-03-12 13:51:23	MrPockets	any creative ideas to avoid having to move the ~2.8tb of files off the NAS, reformat it, and copy them back?
2016-03-12 13:52:21	Free99	MrPockets, you can keep it ntfs but performance isn't quite as good as for ext* etc.. My external hdd is ntfs so I can move it around (which I haven't done even once)

This means that you can access a file stored in the distributed file system as in the local file system. ... The most noticeable thing about Ceph is that it is included in Linux Kernel source. ... as Linux develops, Ceph may eventually become the main file system of Linux"

Can I do some weird ssh'y/scp/pipey kind of command to open the file over a tunnel but use my machine's vim on the remote machine's file?

2016-03-12 17:13:48	des_consolado	pauliunas: I would advise using systemrescuecd
2016-03-12 17:14:12	des_consolado	pauliunas: from there you should be able to use fdisk to inspect the current status of the disk and partition table

2016-03-12 17:14:49	des_consolado	pauliunas: just dd the systemrescuecd iso onto a thumb drive (or if you're on Windows right now then use the tool Rufus to push this image to the thumb)
2016-03-12 17:14:56	pauliunas	meh, that won't help. i can already boot linux in bios mode and windows in uefi mode

2016-03-12 17:15:24	des_consolado	pauliunas: Uhh... You need to reconfigure the bootloader on the linux system
2016-03-12 17:15:37	des_consolado	pauliunas: You may be able to do that whilst booted up into that linux system in BIOS mode. I'm not sure.

2016-03-12 17:17:16	ayecee	would make it hard to update the bootloader otherwise.

2016-03-12 19:27:31	sauvin	I don't know. If it's at all relevant, in the good old DOS days, if you wanted to restart the machine, you could put a particular value (or bitmask) into a certain memory location and issue a REBOOT interrupt (iirc); depending on that value, you'd get a cold boot or a warm boot.

2016-03-12 21:11:51	Loshki	One caveat. The tiny sendmails (ssmtp, msmtp) are so small they don't queue messages, so you need an always on network connection to the mailserver. Any mail sent while the mailserver is inaccessible will be lost. This makes it ok for servers which are always connected, not so much for laptops where you can lose wifi at any time.

2016-03-12 22:33:18	d0wnsyndrom3	I've used BT5 and Kali a bit. Never tried Tails. I'm thinking about running a live Tails just to see what it's about
2016-03-12 22:33:27	aricz	never heard of Tails
2016-03-12 22:33:40	aricz	that's why I'm interesteda
2016-03-12 22:33:44	d0wnsyndrom3	Apparently it's for secure networking and such
2016-03-12 22:33:47	aricz	and I've used Kali, it's good shitz
2016-03-12 22:33:58	aricz	like OpenBSD?

2016-03-12 22:34:41	d0wnsyndrom3	I'm about to check it out. I just figured I'd ask around first to see if anyone recommended trying it.
2016-03-12 22:34:54	aricz	yeah, same

2016-03-12 22:35:44	d0wnsyndrom3	It's got cryptographic tools. That's a plus.
2016-03-12 22:35:56	aricz	but why you want that?
2016-03-12 22:35:59	aricz	kali live?
2016-03-12 22:36:00	pingfloyd	like thinking sending email through unencrypted

2016-03-12 22:36:22	d0wnsyndrom3	Well, Kali is for penetration testing and security purposes. Tails is for secure browsing and file protection, from what I know

2016-03-15 12:08:00	lindenk	I would like to create my own initramfs to run some stuff and eventually kexec another kernel. Is there a precompiled vmlinuz I can use or do I need to compile my own/how would I go about doing that. This should also support being booted over pxe. So far, I can't seem to find enough information on how to do this
2016-03-15 12:08:00	sauvin	catphish_, I suspect the default shell is distro-dependant. It's usually bash, but that's not a guarantee.

Logically, I need to place them in /etc/udev/rules/something.rules as you can configure stuff when making the devices available.  However, it doesn't seem to work, and I assume it is due to the fact that udev initializes the harddrive early in the bootcyclus, when we're still in initramfs.  how do I configure a setting in udev in such a way that it is applied even if the hardware is initialized in initramfs

2016-03-15 13:50:47	c0fe_machine	diegoaguilar: first of all, BSD was told me to that it was better as well and now in some applications I feel that is correct, specifically for storage because of ZFS and no needing to shoestring multiple technologies within Linux to get somewhat close results. Second, Windows is good for other uses like desktop usage, if you need to use Quickbooks, Photoshop, Illustrator or want to play video games
