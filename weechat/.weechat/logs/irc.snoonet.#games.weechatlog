2016-01-05 22:02:33	JadeFalcons	The Vita honestly isn't all that great, and I like the system.
2016-01-05 22:02:50	JadeFalcons	Good if you like JRPGs, not much else.
2016-01-05 22:02:53	+TheGasMask4	JadeFalcons :(
2016-01-05 22:03:16	UncertainCertainty	i got my vita for danganronpa and persona 4 golden
2016-01-05 22:03:33	+TheGasMask4	I got my Vita for Uncharted and Gravity Rush. And Killzone.
2016-01-05 22:03:42	+TheGasMask4	I was happy with those games
2016-01-05 22:03:53	JadeFalcons	P4G, Danganropa, Muramasa, Gravity Rush, Uncharted and Tearaway are the best it has to offer.
2016-01-05 22:03:56	JadeFalcons	That's really about it.
2016-01-05 22:04:11	UncertainCertainty	i was gonna pick up gravity rush until i saw that they're gonna release a remastered version for the ps4
2016-01-05 22:04:14	JadeFalcons	Well, Zero Escape if you like that style of game too.
2016-01-05 22:04:16	+TheGasMask4	and both Gravity Rush and Tearaway got/getting Ps4 versions.
2016-01-05 22:04:24	+TheGasMask4	Muramasa is fantastic tho
2016-01-05 22:04:25	JadeFalcons	But it's on 3DS too.
2016-01-05 22:04:56	JadeFalcons	The Vita version of Trails of Cold Steel was good too.
2016-01-05 22:05:00	JadeFalcons	But it's also on PS3.
2016-01-05 22:05:12	+TheGasMask4	MonsterBag best Vita game

2016-01-05 22:05:54	JadeFalcons	P4G could have easily been on PS3 or 4 and been even better.
2016-01-05 22:06:07	UncertainCertainty	vita memory cards tho
2016-01-05 22:06:14	UncertainCertainty	fuck that
2016-01-05 22:06:25	JadeFalcons	I don't even rank P4G in my favorite Shin Megami Tensei games either.
2016-01-05 22:06:33	JadeFalcons	It has a fair few problems in my opinion.
2016-01-05 22:06:46	JadeFalcons	It's good, but has flaws that hold it back.

2016-01-05 22:08:09	JadeFalcons	The best ones in my opinion are Nocturne, the DDS games, P3 FES, SMT IV, and SMT II.
2016-01-05 22:08:30	JadeFalcons	Worst one hands down is Persona Q.
2016-01-05 22:08:39	JadeFalcons	Garbage Persona game, garbage Etrian Odyssey game.
2016-01-05 22:08:51	JadeFalcons	Worst of both worlds.

2016-01-05 22:09:33	JadeFalcons	Etrian 5 looks great.

2016-01-05 22:11:54	JadeFalcons	The game barely shows any SMT influence, and they fucked up the FE elements.
2016-01-05 22:12:04	JadeFalcons	The only passing resemblance to SMT is the elemental weakness system.

2016-01-05 22:33:15	JadeFalcons	It's on 3DS, Wii U, Vita, Xbone, PS3, and PS4.
2016-01-05 22:33:30	JadeFalcons	I bought it for the PS4 due to the ease of couch multiplayer.
2016-01-05 22:33:40	JadeFalcons	I'd imagine it'd be excellent on handhelds though.
2016-01-05 22:33:54	UncertainCertainty	it might be region-locked for the nintendo consoles tho

2016-01-05 22:34:44	JadeFalcons	I stand corrected.
2016-01-05 22:34:51	JadeFalcons	Nintendo versions are region locked.

2016-01-05 22:38:04	JadeFalcons	Puyo Puyo is a largely Japanese puzzle game.
2016-01-05 22:38:08	UncertainCertainty	i had tetris on my crappy sliding cellphone in high school. played the hell out of that. i'm decent at tetris.
2016-01-05 22:38:26	JadeFalcons	Sega has the rights to it right now I think.
2016-01-05 22:39:19	JadeFalcons	The way you play is you have to defeat your opponent by filling up their side with trash tiles. You drop these colored blobs down and you match up to four of them to clear them off the board.
2016-01-05 22:39:41	JadeFalcons	Think Puzzle Fighter without the breaker blocks and it's a match-4+
