2016-01-31 16:10:51	Airblader	It seems surreal that just over a year ago I knew next to no C and all I did was merge upstream into some gaps fork and somehow it lead to today.
2016-01-31 16:11:21	tonyctl	i3 was my first C project as well

2016-01-31 16:12:59	tonyctl	lol yeah
2016-01-31 16:13:14	tonyctl	it's very good for your development as a programmer to know C though since it's closer to the hardware
2016-01-31 16:13:43	Airblader	I actually owe a lot to i3 and in particular Michael. Not just on a personal level. Didn't look too bad at my work either when they saw my Github profile or heard about the price from Google.
2016-01-31 16:13:56	Airblader	Yet another reason I'd love to meet Michael.
2016-01-31 16:14:30	tonyctl	yeah he's so good with reviewing pull requests
2016-01-31 16:15:07	Airblader	Indeed. I love the attention to detail.
2016-01-31 16:15:15	Airblader	Very crucial for the quality of a project.
2016-01-31 16:15:22	claf	you're making me want to contribute guys :)
2016-01-31 16:15:23	tonyctl	I learned so much from those reviews
2016-01-31 16:15:47	tonyctl	you'll definitely learn a lot by contributing
2016-01-31 16:15:49	Airblader	We actually do code reviews that strict at work, too, so it wasn't new to me. In the contrary, it's how I know how important they are.
2016-01-31 16:16:00	Airblader	claf: Pick up your editor and start :)
2016-01-31 16:16:49	claf	Airblader: I'm a fresh i3 user so give me some time to use it, but I'm pretty interested in a feature request you should be aware of : persistent placeholder/layout
2016-01-31 16:16:57	claf	so ... maybe ... :)
2016-01-31 16:17:08	Airblader	claf: Yeah, I've heard of that before... :P
2016-01-31 16:17:51	Airblader	claf: It's a feature request in a conglomerate of like two others that all sort of need the same foundation in the code. Someone gets one of them working, the others are easy enough to do, too.
2016-01-31 16:17:55	claf	do you guys use the repository for you i3 (since you seem to contribute) or do you clone the git and install from it everytime you add some code?
2016-01-31 16:18:42	claf	Airblader: I'm going at least to try to look at the code when I'll have some time
2016-01-31 16:18:50	Airblader	claf: Well I run i3-gaps, but I do just make install it from my local checkout. It's not exactly super clean, but hey, it's the one thing that I definitely know my way around.
2016-01-31 16:19:08	claf	maybe I'll poke you and ask you some question if you're there
2016-01-31 16:19:17	claf	i3-gaps? not aware of that
2016-01-31 16:19:21	Airblader	claf: Sure, anytime. You can also ask on the mailing list.
2016-01-31 16:19:37	claf	oh! I'll subscribe right now
2016-01-31 16:20:17	Airblader	claf: i3-gaps is a fork that I maintain. So I usually contribute to i3 and once it's merged, I merge upstream i3 into the fork.
2016-01-31 16:20:37	claf	-done-
2016-01-31 16:20:54	claf	what are this fork specialties?
2016-01-31 16:20:54	Airblader	claf: Compiling it and restarting it between merging and pushing is a good last check that everything is in order. Building a package from it first every single time would be too troublesome.

2016-01-31 17:13:08	Airblader	Plus you shouldn't be merging all kinds of random features and make them configurable. It's feature creep and makes maintenance extremely difficult.
2016-01-31 17:13:36	foolishmonkey	I'm always open about merging features
2016-01-31 17:13:51	Airblader	https://faq.i3wm.org/question/778/why-is-patch-not-merged-and-made-optional/
2016-01-31 17:13:52		[ http://is.gd/U6CUIg ]
2016-01-31 17:13:56	foolishmonkey	But the base code must be designed for that.
2016-01-31 17:14:33	Airblader	The thing to realize is that the way gaps are implemented in i3 is nothing short of a hack. The fact that titlebars need to be disabled to avoid glitches shows that it shouldn't be in upstream.
2016-01-31 17:14:36	foolishmonkey	I'm more into emacs philosophy, bigger is better :
2016-01-31 17:14:54	foolishmonkey	maybe some part must be rewrite
2016-01-31 17:15:26	Airblader	foolishmonkey: You can afford more complexity if you have the team to handle it. Given that i3 consists mostly of Michael, who does mostly operational stuff at this point, and me, our dev base isn't big enough to afford all kinds of complexity.
2016-01-31 17:15:47	foolishmonkey	Airblader, ho I see
2016-01-31 17:16:01	foolishmonkey	Maybe I should hack into i3 one day, maybe...
2016-01-31 17:16:45	Airblader	Well, that's the thing. There are plenty of users who come by once and want something merged. The key is that you need an actual long-time team working on it, otherwise the 1-2 people have to maintain all those things over time. :)
2016-01-31 17:17:11	Airblader	I don't always agree with Michael's decisions either when he rejects requests
2016-01-31 17:17:27	Airblader	But overall, there's a system behind not dumping everything into a projec.t
2016-01-31 17:18:13	Airblader	You end up with dozens of build switches, compile configurations, feature flags and config directives until no one understands it anymore, reproducing problems becomes basically impossible and the codebase is untestable in its entirety.
2016-01-31 17:18:56	Airblader	Michael likes to talk about "mental complexity" and it makes a lot of sense. People barely read the docs as it is; if they were ten times longer, I wouldn't even be blaming them.
2016-01-31 17:18:59	foolishmonkey	Yes, but you're here. You can maintain your feature :)
2016-01-31 17:19:33	Airblader	foolishmonkey: Maybe so, but gaps are still really just a hack and go against the philosophy i3 was built upon :)
2016-01-31 17:20:06	Airblader	foolishmonkey: It increases the work I have to do, but I fully understand where Michael is coming from not wanting it in there and, in fact, I agree.
2016-01-31 17:20:10	foolishmonkey	Clean your code.
2016-01-31 17:20:14	foolishmonkey	;)
2016-01-31 17:20:29	Airblader	Implementing the gaps "properly" would probably be a major rewrite.
2016-01-31 17:20:44	Airblader	The reason I don't do that in the fork is because it kills maintainability
2016-01-31 17:21:01	Airblader	Right now, I can farely easily merge upstream with only the occasional conflict.
2016-01-31 17:21:08	Airblader	*fairly
2016-01-31 17:21:48	Airblader	Gaps work fine to the end user and while code-wise the situation isn't ideal, my priority is staying up to date with upstream.
2016-01-31 17:22:32	Airblader	I do slowly but steadily work towards improving i3 in certain areas, though, and I did get some things merged upstream by now
2016-01-31 17:22:50	Airblader	But gaps 100% won't ever be in upstream i3.
2016-01-31 17:23:11	Airblader	Even if properly implemented, it doesn't suit the philosophy Michael set for i3.

2016-02-02 12:08:15	nullsem	fair enough
2016-02-02 12:08:26	nullsem	I will switch to another terminal (like urxvt or smth)

2016-02-02 12:10:10	Airblader	nullsem: Just to be clear, with restart i3 I mean "i3-msg restart", you don't need to exit the session.

2016-02-02 13:36:06	Nobody12345	now it works.... I have to change "primary" to LVDS1
2016-02-02 13:37:27	Airblader	Nobody12345: It'd work with "primary" if you actually made LVDS1 primary, but you didn't.
2016-02-02 13:37:48	Airblader	Nobody12345: The xrandr output says that it's not marked primary.
2016-02-02 13:38:02	Airblader	Nobody12345: Of course setting tray_output to LVDS1 will also work. Just depends on what you want.

It runs fine on my desktop but when I copied it to my laptop and set up the i3 conf the same way as my desktop it refuses to run. I can launch it in the terminal same way as I can on my main machine but for some reason i3 on the laptop refuses to run it. No error message or anything..

I'm speacking of the little (black in my case) box that display infos when you stay on lets say a thunderbird button, or on pidgin contacts. This sometimes displays usefulls informations (in case of pidgin it is) and the tooltip juste stays for 1 or 2 second max, I can't manage to read it :)

2016-02-05 19:05:41	m_ben	there is a eclipse plugin that gives you vim-style key bindings
2016-02-05 19:06:19	okraits	Airblader: I think that Eclipse provides a more complete and integrated experience but it might be some work to set up a project for it

2016-02-05 19:11:33	m_ben	okraits: concerning your earlier question: let's assume you want to replace Foo by FooBar. first you do ":args `ag -l Foo`" to open all files containing "Foo" using ag (the silver searcher, parallel replacement of grep), then you can do ":argdo %s/Foo/FooBar/g | w", the "|w
2016-02-05 19:11:44	m_ben	the "|w" is to write to file

2016-02-05 19:14:40	jpleau	It's very nice even if you don't use Qt, it can use clang for autocompletion and clang-format to format the code

2016-02-05 22:17:36	m_ben	somis: I think dynamic refers to the fact that you don't have a predefined layout, you change your window layout dynamically, by adding, shifting, moving or removing windows from a workspace

2016-02-05 22:22:25	somis	i don't use the layouts yet. but you can automat all of it.

2016-02-05 22:24:16	somis	i sign my application to workspaces. example firefox opens in WS1. now it uses the full screen. but with a layout i could define how big the window should be. to leave some space for a terminal.
2016-02-05 22:25:41	somis	m_ben: I even use the mouse a lot. floating windows and resize. It feels natural for me.

2016-02-07 16:29:25	litb	hello all
2016-02-07 16:29:41	litb	i tried to run a video as desktop wallpaper 
2016-02-07 16:30:11	litb	mpv --wid=0 http://www.ustream.tv/channel/17074538 .. this is supposed to show the ISS livestream as background
2016-02-07 16:30:12		[ http://is.gd/laky6s ]
2016-02-07 16:30:30	litb	however, mpv shows the video displayed by approx half of my screen width
2016-02-07 16:30:41	litb	any idea what could cause that?
2016-02-07 16:31:49	litb	i have looked into its manpage,and it says that --geometry is not supported if you specify a parent window (root). so I presume it's supposed to take the full space of the background. so the reason I thought is i3. how can I tell it that mpv should take all the space?

2016-02-07 16:34:07	litb	it apepars to be because I have a second screen (my TV) so mpv is stretched across both
2016-02-07 16:34:07	pllz	(anyways nice idea... never thought about it :))
2016-02-07 16:35:38	litb	now the answer on that FAQ says that makes no sense on i3 bacause it's tiling and you can't see the background. I disagree 3 years later. with the event of compositors it's different
2016-02-07 16:35:42	litb	so it's worth solving

2016-02-07 17:31:58	NoOova	Hi
2016-02-07 17:32:00	phil22	someone has tried to configure proxy for chrome under i3?
2016-02-07 17:32:27	NoOova	phil22: just export http_proxy or https_proxy before running chrome
2016-02-07 17:32:32	NoOova	It written in chrome man
2016-02-07 17:33:17	phil22	but then I need to restart chrome every time I need to switch proxy
2016-02-07 17:33:24	NoOova	yep
2016-02-07 17:33:39	phil22	I don't like it
2016-02-07 17:33:42	NoOova	=) i too
2016-02-07 17:33:46	pllz	NoOova, what's the --name option?
2016-02-07 17:33:58	phil22	usually in gnome, chrome get the proxy setting in dconf
2016-02-07 17:34:09	phil22	but somehow, in i3 chrome decides to ignore dconf
2016-02-07 17:34:09	NoOova	pllz: itake it in /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc script
2016-02-07 17:34:23	NoOova	i think it is like name of logon shell
2016-02-07 17:34:39	pllz	NoOova, it's nothing of what you think i guess
2016-02-07 17:34:52	NoOova	(i think it is argument of exec, not argument of a program)
2016-02-07 17:34:56	pllz	you are using it as an i3 option
2016-02-07 17:35:09	NoOova	and it fails because of wrong option?
2016-02-07 17:35:38	NoOova	looks truthly =)
2016-02-07 17:35:41	NoOova	One moment
2016-02-07 17:35:46	pllz	just try :)
2016-02-07 17:36:01	NoOova	phil22: try to search extension like "FoxyProxy" but for chrome ;)
2016-02-07 17:36:45	pllz	phil22, i3 has nothing to do with proxies
2016-02-07 17:37:13	phil22	I know, but chrome in i3 behaves differently than in gnome
2016-02-07 17:37:19	phil22	so I wondered if there's some fix for it
2016-02-07 17:37:24	pllz	so under i3, or under xfce, or anythin else is the same
2016-02-07 17:37:29	phil22	but the chrome extension idea is good
2016-02-07 17:37:30	NoOova	Intresting, background process view changes of master process environment?)
2016-02-07 17:37:57	phil22	pllz, nope, under gnome (and maybe xfce) chrome reads proxy configs from dconf
2016-02-07 17:38:06	NoOova	Maybe run chrome with '&' and reexport 'http_proxy' when need
2016-02-07 17:39:08	pllz	phil22, oh in a desktop environment you may have something set, right... i was thinking about proxy options -within- chrome, sorry
2016-02-07 17:40:15	phil22	np :P
2016-02-07 17:40:37	pllz	NoOova, firefox for example has an option that sounds like "use system proxy settings"
2016-02-07 17:41:04	pllz	so if they are changed i guess it's reflected into the browser, too
2016-02-07 17:41:34	pllz	don't know chrome, maybe there is something similar?

2016-02-08 18:29:10	f8l	Not exactly anything, but whatever using a computer for is reasonable.
2016-02-08 18:31:03	f8l	I’m also curious. That’s why I run NetBSD. I got bored with Linux. Even Arch wasn’t challenging enough.

2016-02-09 11:21:39	f8l	INSTALL in pacman seems to be outdated. There is no configure script. It has to be generated first.

2016-02-09 11:24:45	PMunch	Is there a way to get an autohiding dock that would overlay windows? I've tried a couple different ones and they all seems to take up some space on the edge.

2016-02-09 11:25:58	f8l	szt: The resulting configure script errors out (can’t find config.h.in), so I guess pacman does not run everywhere.
2016-02-09 11:26:56	f8l	PMunch: What did you try? I think the hide mode is what you are looking for.
2016-02-09 11:27:57	PMunch	The hide mode? I tried a couple various docks (Plank, tint2 etc.) I'm using this to try out how using i3 on a tablet would work.
2016-02-09 11:28:08	PMunch	So I need something that supports touching
2016-02-09 11:28:23	PMunch	Basically just a couple buttons in a bar

2016-02-09 11:30:00	f8l	PMunch: We probably have incompatible definitions of dock. I thought you were talking about what some programs use to indicate their status. i3bar has a built-in dock, and it doesn’t take any space in hide mode.
2016-02-09 11:31:58	f8l	szt: Do you really know any BSD users? That system is inactive for at least twenty years.
2016-02-09 11:32:02	PMunch	I realized as much after I wrote my last message. i3bar is what I use for system info but I want a program launching dock (or rather command running dock) which autohides out the bottom.
2016-02-09 11:32:27	PMunch	The problem is that when they are shown they take up space instead of overlapping windows

I remember One of my first Mensa gatherings where, as a part of a game which was meant to help memorising names, I was tasked with saying an adjective which begins with the first letter of my name. „Mizerny” was the first thing that came to my mind, and that’s what helped other Mensans remember my name. That’s just hilarious.

2016-02-09 19:21:58	Kelsar	only system i saw yet, which atleast does it decent with new applications is windows 10
2016-02-09 19:22:05	Bubo	when I move my cursor to the top right or bottom right of my 1440p monitor it doesn't move to the 1080p monitor ._. only when I move the cursor on the right center it goes to the other monitor
2016-02-09 19:22:06	Bubo	weird

2016-02-09 19:27:38	Kelsar	Bubo: it is just how X works
2016-02-09 19:27:46	Bubo	You can even overlap monitors

2016-02-09 19:28:02	Bubo	so monitor 2 can overlap like 50% on monitor 1

2016-02-09 19:28:18	Bubo	Kelsar, what do you mean triangle?
2016-02-09 19:28:43	f8l	There is even a mode in which the view pans when the pointer moves.

2016-02-09 19:29:34	Bubo	I just bought a new 1440p monitor so this is my first time with multiple monitor setup
2016-02-09 19:29:49	Bubo	should've bought one way earlier..
2016-02-09 19:30:01	*	strcat bought a 27 inch 4k monitor to avoid wanting 2 monitors ;p
2016-02-09 19:30:42	Kelsar	got 28" 4k, IMHO too small, should be atleast 30"
2016-02-09 19:31:16	strcat	Kelsar: well I had to choose between 27/32 and went with 27 as I don't really *want* it larger
2016-02-09 19:31:24	*	f8l is going to get castAR in order to use it as a monitor.
2016-02-09 19:31:45	strcat	at least with i3, since it uses the full screen real estate
2016-02-09 19:31:54	strcat	guess it also depends on how far away you sit from it
2016-02-09 19:31:57	Bubo	i3 is awesome
2016-02-09 19:32:00	Kelsar	strcat: need the room, if i wanted to replace 2 monitors with one
2016-02-09 19:32:22	*	strcat also only ever wants 2 things visible at a time so... there's that too ;)
2016-02-09 19:32:32	strcat	went from 1080p 21 inch -> 4k 27 inch
2016-02-09 19:32:48	strcat	before even the single split wasn't quite comfortable
2016-02-09 19:32:53	Kelsar	strcat: that is abig step 
2016-02-09 19:33:11	strcat	amazon coerced me into buying it with a sale + it was the last one available ;)

2016-02-09 19:53:31	callipygous	I think something like that got pulled in recently
2016-02-09 19:54:17	f8l	Did you see a message with instructions on how to install the certificates?
2016-02-09 19:54:28	callipygous	no, it must have flashed by quickly
2016-02-09 19:54:53	f8l	You can read it in pkgsrc/security/mozilla-rootcerts/MESSAGE.
2016-02-09 19:55:57	f8l	There is also a security/mozilla-rootcerts-openssl package which installs the certificates in a hacky way.
2016-02-09 19:56:14	callipygous	yeah, mustn't have been installed
2016-02-09 19:56:41	f8l	Make sure to read its DESCR before use.
2016-02-09 19:57:30	callipygous	so I need it to get this working?
2016-02-09 19:57:37	f8l	Probably.
2016-02-09 19:58:46	callipygous	how do I search to see if a package is installed?
2016-02-09 19:58:56	f8l	The rule is that packages shouldn’t touch /etc, and OpenSSL requires the certificates to be put there, so that package breaks that rule if you don’t want to install them manually.
2016-02-09 19:59:19	f8l	‘pkg_info -e «package»’ if I remember correctly.
2016-02-09 20:00:57	callipygous	neither is installed, then
2016-02-09 20:01:03	f8l	Alternatively ‘pkg_info | grep «you know what»’.

2016-02-09 22:43:26	indeedwatson	i gave up on lemonbar
2016-02-09 22:43:33	mekhami	the bar looks pretty amazing right now
2016-02-09 22:43:40	mekhami	it's just lacking a tiny bit of functionality
2016-02-09 22:43:47	indeedwatson	im jelly, i should try again some time

2016-02-09 22:44:48	mekhami	i changed the glyph font to fontawesome though
2016-02-09 22:44:56	f8l	callipygous: It was probably something that should already be included in the package.
2016-02-09 22:45:03	indeedwatson	hah, his setup looks so amazing it's hard to to copy him

2016-02-11 15:41:04	PrinceAMD	ohhh
2016-02-11 15:42:10	PrinceAMD	Airblader, is it possible to open a app based on the output name
2016-02-11 15:42:15	PrinceAMD	output name + workspace?

2016-02-11 15:43:51	Airblader	PrinceAMD: application != window, so in general, "no". If the application supports startup notifications, you can do "workspace x, exec /path/to/file" (important to call it without --no-startup-id). For windows (not applications), you can use the "assign" directive.
2016-02-11 15:44:17	Airblader	oh wait you said output
2016-02-11 15:44:37	Airblader	You can assign the window to a specific workspace and the workspace to a specific output.
2016-02-11 15:46:01	Airblader	PrinceAMD: Maybe I'm not understanding what you want
2016-02-11 15:47:18	PrinceAMD	exactly what you said... i think you understand me
2016-02-11 15:47:55	PrinceAMD	example, i want to open google-chrome on workspace 5 which is on fake-1
2016-02-11 15:48:17	PrinceAMD	but i3-msg seems to not be reading the command correctly
2016-02-11 15:48:38	Airblader	Why do you want to use fake outputs?

2016-02-12 12:35:27	claf	hi guys, I know it's not the right place to ask but just in case, I have an issue and some quick googling doesn't find me the answer, since some time ago, I messed up something in my sound configuration and now when I use my keyvolume (binded to pactl set volume command) I can go way lower than 0% and way higher than 100%. I can't find a way to make it work as default usually do ... :(
2016-02-12 12:37:33	TorvusBug	claf: are you adjusting by decibels vs. percentages?
2016-02-12 12:40:43	claf	I guess it's percentage let me check
2016-02-12 12:41:03	claf	pactl set-sink-volume 1 +5%
2016-02-12 12:41:05	claf	yep

2016-02-12 12:42:55	TorvusBug	Hmm, I'm not sure about pactl specifically, claf.
2016-02-12 12:43:17	g1gas	does anyone have any experience with dmenu-manjaro?
2016-02-12 12:43:43	claf	it was working quite well before I start playing with the "beep" command, trying to make it work, I played a bit with xset, and stuff like that, without any success. finally I stop trying to make beep work and I was left with a broken volume configuration :)
2016-02-12 12:44:52	claf	TorvusBug: any solution would be a major improvement even if it's using something else, as long as 100% is the max volume :)

2016-02-16 11:12:02	timotheusbooth	whats a scratchpad?
2016-02-16 11:12:12	matt1	yottanami: nope, it's a recent feature

2016-02-16 18:07:46	wwalker	exg, I don't know about i3 for os x.  I love i3, but on OS X I use slate.  it is old and no recent activity, but it works well enough for simple tiling (no where near as sweet as i3).  https://github.com/sdegutis/mjolnir and http://www.hammerspoon.org/go/ are also very cool

2016-02-18 10:45:56	avrelaun	that's the only way I found

I was playing around with XCB events for hover detection in i3bar and noticed that pointer movement and/or enter/leave events seem to get filtered out by i3 for something called dock windows. Can someone shed some light on this? Am I correct in assuming that i3 indeed filters out those events and they never reach i3bar's XCB loop? If so, what is the reason for this behavior?

2016-02-19 17:53:23	Airblader	The 4th gen X1 Carbon is finally out. Need… to… buy…
2016-02-19 17:56:03	okraits	Airblader: Need a new laptop?
2016-02-19 18:01:05	Airblader	okraits: "Need" is relative. But I can get a new one from my work now… And the X1C has the advantage if being much better suited for lots of meetings.
2016-02-19 18:03:05	okraits	Airblader: So you need a laptop at work to be mobile?
2016-02-19 18:03:49	okraits	Airblader: Can you choose one to be bought or does your company have leasing hardware?
2016-02-19 18:04:22	Airblader	okraits: I mean I have one, but it's a T560 so it's a whole lot heavier. Good for dev work, but I don't do dev anymore, I need it to be more mobile.
2016-02-19 18:04:24	Airblader	okraits: I can choose
2016-02-19 18:04:54	Airblader	I should probably wait until the entire 2016 line is out before choosing :/ But I have the 3rd gen X1C privately so ut's nice to have similar ones.
2016-02-19 18:06:17	okraits	I got myself a new thinkpad in May - but it's a 2013 model i think - a L440
2016-02-19 18:06:32	okraits	but it's pretty nice for hobby stuff at home
2016-02-19 18:07:00	okraits	and i don't have big requirements - was using my 10 year old R50e until May :)
2016-02-19 18:07:28	Airblader	Well I need at least 16 GB RAM and 512 GB SSD. 32 GB / 1 TB would be better, but again, only reaally if I did dev work.
2016-02-19 18:07:29	okraits	I got a more powerful PC, too, though
2016-02-19 18:08:14	Airblader	The X1C4 does barely suffice with 16 GB / 512 GB, plus I can just upgrade the SSD to 1 TB later.

2016-02-19 18:09:45	Airblader	okraits: Yeah, actually. :) We have a virtual machine that reflects the entire application. And it has to run lots of Oracle crap. WebLogic (1-2 app servers, 2 queue servers), Orable database (8 of them), our application, ...
2016-02-19 18:10:13	Airblader	And then you want some RAM left over for the host machine.
2016-02-19 18:10:47	Airblader	I don't use tower PCs anymore :P Except for the stupid customer one we get. Barely ever use it, though. They're total crap.
2016-02-19 18:11:19	Airblader	They have like 4 GB RAM and run Win 10. It's a pain.
2016-02-19 18:11:29	Airblader	Win 8, sorry.
2016-02-19 18:11:39	somis	i see it's "linux compatible" too. (the X1 carbon) 
2016-02-19 18:11:58	Airblader	somis: The 3rd gen runs wonderfully with Linux, yes. Absolutely no work needed.
2016-02-19 18:12:05	Airblader	somis: I hope the 4th gen would too :)
2016-02-19 18:12:33	okraits	Airblader: Heh, bought some WebLogic licenses for a project at MUC, too :)

2016-02-19 18:13:37	Airblader	Nothing is as worthless as Oracle's support.

2016-02-19 18:15:33	Airblader	The thing that bothers me about the X1C4 right now is that I can only get the SATA3 SSD. Upgrading to PCIe does make me go out of the budget I got.

2016-02-19 18:16:05	Airblader	okraits: I mean it's not bad, perfectly fine for most stuff. I just mean in a tower it's so much easier (and cheaper) to put more beefy stuff in there.
2016-02-19 18:16:08	okraits	Airblader: At work i run i3 on Debian stable and virtualbox with Debian stable and the rails environment - the machine is bored ;)
2016-02-19 18:16:59	Airblader	okraits: Yeah… about that. I might actually think about running Windows at work. I feel dirty just considering it, but really all I do with it is emails, browsing, Word and Excel. And for the latter two… :/
2016-02-19 18:17:16	Airblader	I do have my personal machine with me which of course runs i3.
2016-02-19 18:17:57	Airblader	Plus I need to do videoconferencing at work a lot with like remote sharing that only works on Windows, so another reason. Ugh.
2016-02-19 18:18:29	pllz	Airblader, isn't sata3 enough for an ssd?
2016-02-19 18:18:54	Airblader	pllz: "Enough"? Yes. But PCIe is ~2x faster.
2016-02-19 18:18:57	pllz	i mean, more than its maximum speed?
2016-02-19 18:19:11	Airblader	pllz: No, SSDs easily outperform what SATA3 can do these days.
2016-02-19 18:19:15	pllz	Airblader, and current ssds can saturate that?
2016-02-19 18:19:22	pllz	oh ok
2016-02-19 18:19:28	okraits	Airblader: Well, for your usecase, running windows would make sense - though it's not satisfying, of course :)
2016-02-19 18:19:29	somis	Airblader: win 10?
2016-02-19 18:19:44	Airblader	somis: Yeah, Win 10. Better than Win 8. But not the same as my beloved i3. :)
2016-02-19 18:19:55	Airblader	I could dual boot but like what's the point.
2016-02-19 18:20:06	Airblader	Or I just run Win10 in a VM all the time.
2016-02-19 18:20:33	okraits	Airblader: i'm happy i can work with linux now and optimize my environment every day :)

2016-02-19 18:21:14	Airblader	okraits: I optimize my environment on my private machine, too :) I'd probably try Windows for a bit. I'm not sure I'd stick with it. Actually I think with 16 GB RAM running a Windows VM makes sense.
2016-02-19 18:21:50	okraits	Airblader: Do you have your private machine with you at work? What for?
2016-02-19 18:21:52	Airblader	okraits: Then I can do Outlook there (since OWA is even worse than anything on Windows) as well as Word/Excel, but keep using Linux for everyting else.
2016-02-19 18:22:26	Airblader	okraits: Yeah, I always take it with me. Right now mostly bc I use my private machine for meetings since I don't wanna carry arround the T560 from my work to meetings.
2016-02-19 18:22:46	okraits	Airblader: I have to use OWA for work mails, too (apart from mailing lists)
2016-02-19 18:23:12	okraits	Airblader: the main problem is that i don't get desktop notifications if i receive mails
2016-02-19 18:23:17	Airblader	okraits: I can use my private machine for online stuff (Confluence) to like document meetings. I can't store files on it, though.
2016-02-19 18:23:49	Airblader	okraits: OWA is terrible. When I accept like 3 meeting invitations in a row, it just dies. Also, it just dies every now and then for no reason. And the performance is terrible.
2016-02-19 18:24:01	Airblader	okraits: And it implements its own text selection which is super annoying.
2016-02-19 18:24:26	Airblader	I'm not gonna lie, the newer Outlook versions are actually really decent.
2016-02-19 18:24:46	Airblader	I like them equally as much as Thunderbird
2016-02-19 18:25:13	okraits	Airblader: I haven't noticed any bugs yet but handling mailing lists (quoting) must be terrible and the notification issue is really annoying
2016-02-19 18:25:14	Airblader	And Excel is a really useful tool these days (for certain types of work), and LibreOffice just isn't anywhere near it.
2016-02-19 18:25:34	Airblader	okraits: I have even more "bugs" in OWA. It is so annoying :P
2016-02-19 18:26:15	okraits	Airblader: the T560 is 2016, right?
2016-02-19 18:27:04	Airblader	okraits: Oh, is it? I must've been looking at their portfolio for too long. I guess I don't have a T560 at work then, but another one that I now can't think of :D That one is a few years old now in any case.

2016-02-19 18:29:27	Airblader	okraits: Well for example yesterday I was in meetings from 9am to 5pm. Literally not a minute not in a meeting. 2.5kg is just too much to carry around next to my water and what not.
2016-02-19 18:30:30	Airblader	Not that I *couldn't*. Just that if I can avoid it, all the better.
2016-02-19 18:30:50	okraits	Airblader: Ok, but how much lighter does it get? 1 kg less?

2016-02-19 18:31:43	Airblader	okraits: It's not miles, but there can be distances. Plus it's not uncommon for people to change the room like 30sec before the meeting starts and what not. It's just about comfort.

2016-02-19 19:01:10	Airblader	okraits: Most of this stuff is probably (?) way easier these days. They fixed the bugs that would cause MP lags, there's plugins, a ton of new blocks etc.
2016-02-19 19:01:16	Airblader	okraits: This was Minecraft Beta afterall.
2016-02-19 19:01:35	Airblader	okraits: But fixing the cart booster "bug" was a no-go for me :D 
2016-02-19 19:02:15	Airblader	I feel like if I wanted to get back into Minecraft there's just too much to learn.
2016-02-19 19:03:06	Airblader	Plus in those days you'd just work on creating specific logical gates under various restrictions (like one block wide, one block high, fast, ...) to allow building advanced stuff. Now it just all exists.
2016-02-19 19:03:42	Airblader	Oh well. :)

2016-02-19 20:05:15	Merdrod	But is it still the case when using some big applications like Gimp, MATLAB.
2016-02-19 20:05:23	somis	okraits: someone asked in here for a "theme" tool in i3. i told to look at the docs or copy some colors from other i3 users that share the config. looks nice. :-)
2016-02-19 20:06:03	Airblader	Merdrod: When using a big application like Gimp or Matlab, I, personally, like having it as the only window on a workspace. And I want it to take up all the space. Wouldn't you?
2016-02-19 20:06:41	Airblader	Merdrod: i3 does allow you to "float" windows so they aren't tiled automatically. We don't encourage it, though.
2016-02-19 20:06:52	okraits	somis: well, j4-make-config provides some comfort for switching colors - plus you can add machine-specific stuff to your config

2016-02-19 20:37:19	chimp	When assigning programs/window classes to a workspace, is there a way to make child processes also go to that or some other workspace? Use case is I want steam to launch in workspace x, but all steam games to launch in workspace y

2016-02-19 20:40:16	chimp	Airblader: Pretty tempting to do. Pretty much my most hated UX thing of all time is slow opening windows appearing infront of where I'm working and interuptting focus

2016-02-19 20:41:28	Airblader	chimp: You can use no_focus to not let them steal focus, but again, you'd need to list them individually. So you might as well use assign instead.

2016-02-19 20:52:21	Merdrod	But I was double-checking the doc to see if my question was not in.
2016-02-19 20:52:40	Merdrod	Is it possible to reproduce the Alt-Tab behavior.
2016-02-19 20:52:57	Merdrod	Like you have 4 window, and Alt-Tab change alternatively the focus on each window.
2016-02-19 20:53:22	Airblader	Merdrod: I think tonyctl has a script for that. i3 doesn't do that natively, but you can script it.

2016-02-19 20:55:49	Merdrod	Ok I will test that. And I guess i3 doesn't do it for Desktops as well?
2016-02-19 20:56:18	Airblader	Merdrod: You can use "workspace next" or "workspace next_on_output" for that.
2016-02-19 20:57:20	Airblader	Merdrod: By the way, in i3 they aren't called desktops. We call them workspaces.

2016-02-20 12:24:24	f8l	That’s a good game, but it’s probably not the channel to discuss it.
2016-02-20 12:24:28	llankru	somis: yeah, that is why i put the fullscreen in quotes. what i am looking for is a fullscreen-like behaviour limited to the current container, i.e. getting a browser to display nothing but the current website (no addressbar etc) in the container it resides in. while this could possibly be achieved by configuring the browser to just do that by itself i'd rather have i3 handle it if at all possible for flexibility reasons.

2016-02-20 12:28:08	f8l	llankru: Some programs can be tricked into thinking they occupy the whole screen, usually by triggering their own fullscreen function (often bound to F11), and then forcing them back with i3’s fullscreen command.

2016-02-20 12:50:54	f8l	I could also recommend dwb, but it’s been abandoned.
2016-02-20 12:52:22	llankru	f8l: uzbl sounds very promising, but i think i'll stick with chromium for netflix at least. might be worth a thorough look for other usecases though.
2016-02-20 12:52:38	f8l	There are many similar browsers, but most of them are based on old WebKit API, unfortunately. Uzbl can be compiled against the newer API, but that’s about it — it’s not very usable on NetBSD when compiled against WebKit2.

2016-02-20 13:05:18	pllz	f8l, yeah, dwb was a great browser... i'm really sad it's not maintained anymore
2016-02-20 13:07:01	f8l	I wanted to try to port it to WebKit2, but then I thought uzbl may make more sense. Later I can try to reimplement dwb’s features atop dwb. I already have a name dwbl [doable].
2016-02-20 13:08:03	pllz	dwb's feature atop uzbl you mean?
2016-02-20 13:08:16	f8l	The basic features are already there, so it’s probably a question of adjusting the key bindings.
2016-02-20 13:08:23	f8l	Ah, yes. That’s what I meant.
2016-02-20 13:08:27	pllz	np
2016-02-20 13:08:57	pllz	f8l, are you working on a fork or what?
2016-02-20 13:09:36	f8l	Not really. I’ve made a pkgsrc package for uzbl, so I made some tiny changes, but they have been merged upstream.
2016-02-20 13:10:32	f8l	dwbl would probably need only a quite long configuration file and many additional scripts. I doubt I’ll have to change much in uzbl itself.
2016-02-20 13:11:07	pllz	i'd have liked to contribute to dwb and revive it, but i don't feel like i have time/skills right now to do it
2016-02-20 13:11:16	f8l	uzbl-browser is built on top of uzbl (sic! I mean uzbl-core here) that way.
2016-02-20 13:11:45	f8l	The problem with dwb is that portix is hardly reachable.
2016-02-20 13:12:38	pllz	yeah but he already gave up with dwb... it's up to some interested devs to keep it in hand
2016-02-20 13:12:58	pllz	(afaik)
2016-02-20 13:12:59	f8l	There are multiple forks, as far as I know. Maybe you can join them.
2016-02-20 13:13:36	f8l	Also, that’s probably a topic for #dwb…
2016-02-20 13:13:49	pllz	that's sure
2016-02-20 13:15:49	Airblader	llankru: Just for completeness sake, while I also enjoy the container-only fullscreen of Chrome quite a bit -- window managers don't usually implement this because it violates the specs.
2016-02-20 13:17:07	llankru	Airblader: be that as it may, i love the fact it now works as intended to bits
2016-02-20 13:21:21	Airblader	llankru: Understandably. :)

2016-02-20 16:43:40	Airblader	To be fair, the git version is really stable, too. You could just install it without letting your package manager know. That way you are up to date now, but with the next release you go back to non-git.

2016-02-20 17:03:06	m_ben	what is the difference between i3-gaps and i3-gaps-next?
2016-02-20 17:04:19	Airblader	m_ben: gaps-next is the equivalent of i3's next branch, so the development branch.
2016-02-20 17:04:51	Airblader	I'd actually love to get rid of i3-gaps-git and only have i3-gaps-next-git, but I guess a lot of people want the non-dev branch.
2016-02-20 17:06:50	m_ben	I would need a new monitor for i3-gaps
2016-02-20 17:07:06	m_ben	on a laptop it's probably also not worth it

2016-02-20 17:09:36	m_ben	and what laptop is that? mine has just 1600x900, and everything is already pretty small

2016-02-21 10:11:00	brainwash	mrb101: does the command work when run in a terminal window?
2016-02-21 10:12:35	brainwash	if it does not, it will probably print some error message.
2016-02-21 10:12:51	mrb101	brainwash, nope 
2016-02-21 10:13:10	mrb101	it doesn't print any error messages but has not change on the volume

2016-02-21 10:15:23	brainwash	works fine here. what does "pactl list sinks" return?
2016-02-21 10:15:35	mrb101	after tying to set-sink-mute toggle command other commands like set-sink-volume gives error: No valid command specified.
2016-02-21 10:16:39	brainwash	sink 0 may be the wrong one in your case
2016-02-21 10:17:06	mrb101	sink 0 suspended and sink 1 running
2016-02-21 10:17:07	brainwash	should be "set-sink-mute 0 toggle"
2016-02-21 10:17:20	mrb101	i got it i have to change to sink 1 ?

2016-02-21 10:22:48	brainwash	yeah, how is it slow?
2016-02-21 10:23:35	mrb101	xbacklight is another package installed. i was thinking maybe xrandr can manage it!

2016-02-21 10:25:05	brainwash	mrb101: xbacklight is just one additional package, and it's rather small/

2016-02-21 10:44:06	nnscr	i have only tried sonata and ario, but both work fine

2016-02-21 10:44:24	nnscr	which are both gui clients for mpd
2016-02-21 10:44:36	indeedwatson	m_ben: I've also tried that, didn't work either :/
2016-02-21 10:45:11	m_ben	indeedwatson: what do you mean it didn't work? 
2016-02-21 10:46:03	indeedwatson	it won't display any music on the browser
2016-02-21 10:47:02	nnscr	well, at least for mpd, you need to add a directory or single tracks to the library
2016-02-21 10:47:26	nnscr	mpc add <path>
2016-02-21 10:48:33	nnscr	but i guess theres also a button in one of those gui tools. i've configured it once and play / stop / skip using the statusbar or shortcut since then
2016-02-21 10:48:41	indeedwatson	yes with mpd/ncmpdpp i can see the files but they just won't play
2016-02-21 10:49:04	indeedwatson	actually i should try one of the gui programs to see if it's a problem with mpd or ncmpdpp
2016-02-21 10:49:07	m_ben	indeedwatson: impossible. did you follow the guide on the website? you could also try mpv, this always works
2016-02-21 10:49:30	indeedwatson	m_ben: i did, i guess i could try again
2016-02-21 10:49:43	indeedwatson	i use mpv for videos, but i wan't a library and stuff
2016-02-21 10:49:55	nnscr	it might be that you need to add a mixer_type to your ~/.config/mpd/mpd.conf
2016-02-21 10:50:04	m_ben	indeedwatson: man cmus-tutorial
2016-02-21 10:50:50	nnscr	at least i have a line mixer_type "software" in my config, i think i've added that back then because i didn't get sound aswell
2016-02-21 10:51:18	indeedwatson	I have mixer type "alsa"
2016-02-21 10:51:36	indeedwatson	oh and it says mixer_type "software" below as well
2016-02-21 10:53:19	indeedwatson	m_ben: yeah, already fails at step 2, it says to select files or folders and press a, but i can't see any files
2016-02-21 10:53:45	nnscr	mh... what happens if you do "mpc play", does it say it is playing?
2016-02-21 10:54:07	nnscr	indeedwatson: have you set a music_directory?
2016-02-21 10:55:26	indeedwatson	nnscr: if i do mpc play it says playing and the track name, but i dont hear a thing
2016-02-21 10:55:32	indeedwatson	i did set the music directory
2016-02-21 10:55:55	nnscr	and the volume is high enough?
2016-02-21 10:55:58	nnscr	in mpd i mean
2016-02-21 10:55:59	indeedwatson	says volume %100
2016-02-21 10:56:16	indeedwatson	and i can hear other programs obviously
2016-02-21 10:56:19	m_ben	indeedwatson: playing music in general works?
2016-02-21 10:56:31	indeedwatson	in rhythmbox and mpv, yeah
2016-02-21 10:56:59	deuill	Hi, question about i3bar: Is it possible to specify that i3bar should only ever appear on the primary monitor?
2016-02-21 10:57:06	deuill	So far I've been able to get an approximation by specifying multiple "output" rules, but this doesn't work well when the rules are mutually exclusive.
2016-02-21 10:57:10	indeedwatson	nnscr: which would you recommend between sonata and aria, to give one a try
2016-02-21 10:57:11	nnscr	indeedwatson: if i get you right, you said that you have both a mixer_type alsa AND software, have you tried commenting one and restarting the daemon?
2016-02-21 10:57:48	deuill	(Say, when I connect an external screen to my laptop, I want i3bar to appear on that screen alone, but when the screen is disconnected, it should appear on the laptop screen)
2016-02-21 10:57:52	nnscr	indeedwatson: not sure, i've installed them when i installed mpd but didn't use them really since then as i have all interface i need in my statusbar
2016-02-21 10:58:07	indeedwatson	nnscr: no, I misunderstood you, i have audio output { type "alsa", and then mixer_type "software"
2016-02-21 10:58:21	nnscr	ah, ok
2016-02-21 10:59:30	m_ben	indeedwatson: in cmus, did you go into the directory with your *mp3 files?
2016-02-21 10:59:39	nnscr	but neither sonata nor ario will output anything if mpd doesn't work as they just send the same command as mpc under the hood
2016-02-21 10:59:48	indeedwatson	m_ben: yes
2016-02-21 11:00:13	m_ben	indeedwatson: and nothing shows up?
2016-02-21 11:00:43	m_ben	indeedwatson: maybe your terminal color settings are messed up
2016-02-21 11:01:24	indeedwatson	m_ben: the selection bar would scroll up/down between invisible files if that was the case

2016-02-21 11:08:14	indeedwatson	it's the normal i3bar, not even i3blocks cause i was lazy to set that up
2016-02-21 11:08:39	indeedwatson	well more like it had some dependency i did not like so i didn't install it
2016-02-21 11:09:17	nnscr	ah, so that are unicode icons, right?
2016-02-21 11:10:15	indeedwatson	yeah, i think the font is called awesome

2016-02-21 17:17:26	Airblader	zzo38: As a sort of workaround, if you use titlebars (not just pixel borders), you could write a script for the IPC that uses title_format to add some indication of whether a window is floating.
2016-02-21 17:17:51	zzo38	Yes that was going to be my other suggestion, which is to add an icon to the title bar to indicate it instead
2016-02-21 17:19:16	Airblader	zzo38: With a script you can add that yourself. Either a text indicator or an icon using some iconic font.
2016-02-21 17:19:20	zzo38	By using xsetroot and --no-startup-id I have been able to force the X shape cursor for the root window (which normally isn't visible, although if a new workspace is opened it will be) at least
2016-02-21 17:19:42	zzo38	Airblader: How to add such a script though?
2016-02-21 17:20:10	zzo38	I would want to add the VT100 diamond indicator, perhaps
2016-02-21 17:20:30	zzo38	The font I am using is "fixed" so it should include such things.
2016-02-21 17:21:14	Airblader	zzo38: There are docs on the IPC on the i3 website. There's also a lot of IPC implementations, anything from Perl to Python to Javascript. Maybe check out "acrisci" on Github, he has IPC implementations and example scripts.
2016-02-21 17:21:40	zzo38	I have written a status bar implementation in C already at least

2016-02-21 17:32:26	Airblader	zzo38: Cursor is trickier. There's no IPC interface here and i3 entirely lacks any kind of configuration of when which cursor is set. It only sets the cursor theme correctly. The only way would probably be to fully track windows and the mouse and set the cursor correspondingly without the IPC. That'd be a lot of work, though.
2016-02-21 17:33:22	zzo38	At least I can see in the documentation, how to affect the window title

2016-02-21 17:42:20	Airblader	sLite: I'm toying with the idea of supporting those windows in i3-gaps, but if instead we can ignore them in i3 and that works, that'd be better.

2016-02-21 17:43:49	Airblader	zzo38: If you do wanna tackle it, I suggest you look at my project "xedgewarp" on Github. Pointer tracking is actually not trivial, you need to use XInput for it.

2016-02-21 18:00:02	Airblader	sLite: Thanks! That's much better.
2016-02-21 18:00:24	sLite	the popup stuff is pretty hacky
2016-02-21 18:00:29	zzo38	Actually by "xwininfo -tree" I have figured outo these answers about subwindows and so on anyways
2016-02-21 18:01:06	Airblader	sLite: Yeah, and that's what I'm worried about. Maybe it can be rewritten in a more general, less KDE-specific hacky way.
2016-02-21 18:01:20	sLite	that would be cool
2016-02-21 18:01:41	sLite	but i think the kwm guys do some very specific suff for some apps and plasma
2016-02-21 18:01:50	Airblader	sLite: I might come back to you on that (mostly how I can trigger the situations that would break without the patches) and see where I can go with it.
2016-02-21 18:02:20	Airblader	sLite: I'll just need to find time. Especially since I don't use KDE myself.
2016-02-21 18:02:25	sLite	docks, krunner and knotify cause the most pain afair
2016-02-21 18:03:15	Airblader	sLite: What happens without the patches?
2016-02-21 18:03:48	sLite	a lot of unwanted focus stealing
2016-02-21 18:04:10	Airblader	sLite: I think nowadays you could just use i3's "no_focus" for that (?)
2016-02-21 18:04:15	sLite	and stuff getting managed that you want floating without borders

2016-02-21 18:05:22	sLite	i will wrap my head around it again and give you an update if you have some time
2016-02-21 18:05:52	sLite	i would love if we could get the upstream i3 to work with kde
2016-02-21 18:06:08	sLite	i'm more than willing to offer with anything i can help :)
2016-02-21 18:06:10	Airblader	sLite: Yeah, I'd love to hear it, but no rush. When you do try reverting the popup patch and the focus stealing happens, check out if no_focus can be used.
2016-02-21 18:06:36	Airblader	sLite: If I get time I'll try experimenting with it, too.
2016-02-21 18:06:43	sLite	ok, i think that hasn't been available back when i ported the stuff over
2016-02-21 18:06:56	Airblader	sLite: Yeah, no_focus is relatively new
2016-02-21 18:07:11	sLite	i remember asking back then and i got the answer that thats an X11 issue and i3 can't do anything about it
2016-02-21 18:07:25	zzo38	I do not use KDE and GNOME I don't like it, i3 is much better. I use the mod+Enter for opening a new xterm and then can start any program from there. (I don't use cursor themes either)
2016-02-21 18:07:26	sLite	nice to hear that there is a solution for that
2016-02-21 18:07:30	sLite	i'll check it out
2016-02-21 18:08:19	Airblader	sLite: Well it can't be an "X issue" if a patch in i3 fixed it, can it. :)
2016-02-21 18:08:32	Airblader	sLite: It just wasn't configurability i3 wanted back then, I guess.
2016-02-21 18:08:39	Airblader	sLite: I think no_focus should work, though.
2016-02-21 18:08:47	sLite	i thought so too back then, because it wasnt an issue in kwm either
2016-02-21 18:09:03	sLite	but well, i just accepted the answer and started to work around it ;)
2016-02-21 18:09:14	Airblader	zzo38: KDE and Gnome aren't the same category as i3. KDE is a DE, i3 is a WM. You can use KDE *with* i3 (which is what sLite does)
2016-02-21 18:11:03	zzo38	Yes OK you can, although I don't use desktop environment (I have uninstalled it)
2016-02-21 18:11:07	Airblader	sLite: The only thing I see in the patch that config can't do is preventing NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DOCK+NET_WM_STATE_STAYS_IN_TOP to dock.
2016-02-21 18:11:18	Airblader	zzo38: Yeah, I don't use a DE either.
2016-02-21 18:11:53	sLite	Airblader: i think there were some issues with doing the float+no border by config that moved the windows out of their initial position
2016-02-21 18:12:17	Airblader	sLite: Maybe that was a bug back then. Sounds worth trying whether it's still needed.
2016-02-21 18:13:25	sLite	Airblader: yup, i always did that when remerging upstream
2016-02-21 18:14:03	sLite	Airblader: i will get back to you when i know the current state of things, maybe we can figure out some solution together
2016-02-21 18:14:14	Airblader	sLite: Yeah, that'd be great.

2016-02-21 20:23:02	einalex	that tends to be complicated if the other container is a more complicated structure
2016-02-21 20:24:24	pllz	einalex, how's that complicated? focus, splith/splitv, move

2016-02-21 20:30:59	pllz	einalex, but actually what's the problem with $mod+v, $mod+Return, $mod+Shift+Up/Down (depending on which one is focused)?
2016-02-21 20:31:29	einalex	pllz: try this:
2016-02-21 20:31:54	einalex	create a horizontal split. then split the left side vertically and change it to tabbed.
2016-02-21 20:31:56	pllz	einalex, yeh sorry if i can't get your point... it's late too :)
2016-02-21 20:32:26	einalex	and then try getting a window above the tabbed bot only on the left side
2016-02-21 20:33:00	pllz	"change it to tabbed" which one?
2016-02-21 20:33:17	einalex	the left part
2016-02-21 20:33:57	einalex	horizontal split, tabs on left side, try to get a window above the tabs
2016-02-21 20:34:28	pllz	you can brutally spawn a new term (which will be tabbed) and then move up
2016-02-21 20:34:58	einalex	indeed that works.
2016-02-21 20:35:18	einalex	otherwise you can move the left side that got moved downwards to the left again..
2016-02-21 20:35:23	einalex	but that is kind of crude
2016-02-21 20:36:07	pllz	the orthodox way would be focus parent, spawn the term, focus the tabbed container (parent), and move it down (i think)
2016-02-21 20:37:04	einalex	mhm, that works as well
2016-02-21 20:37:39	pllz	yeh, once you get used on how that works it's almost easy
2016-02-21 20:39:02	einalex	I figured the most elegant (and thus most likely implemented) solution would be to have the option to open on the other side..

2016-02-23 17:24:50	varaindemian	why it doesn;t work alt+d? I use i3 under gnome (arch linux)? It just appears the loading cursor and this is it..
2016-02-23 17:26:48	michaelrose	alt+d is not a command depends on what its bound to
2016-02-23 17:26:58	michaelrose	I assume you have set alt to me $mod
2016-02-23 17:27:28	michaelrose	and d would be bound to dmenu by default, which you would need to install if you don't have it yet
2016-02-23 17:28:02	varaindemian	hmm how do I install it?
2016-02-23 17:28:11	michaelrose	with your package manager?
2016-02-23 17:28:23	michaelrose	in arch its pacman
2016-02-23 17:28:36	michaelrose	but there are a few alternatives that are better
2016-02-23 17:28:43	michaelrose	rofi for example
2016-02-23 17:29:01	michaelrose	https://davedavenport.github.io/rofi/
2016-02-23 17:29:02		[ http://is.gd/sk8sQZ ]
2016-02-23 17:29:11	michaelrose	should be available in the aur
2016-02-23 17:29:48	michaelrose	though it does seem bizaar that you are on a tech oriented distro, with a tech oriented environment and don't know how to install software
2016-02-23 17:30:07	michaelrose	did you mean manjaro?
2016-02-23 17:30:45	varaindemian	michaelrose: I know how to install it, but I thought i3 has it's own 'thing' for installing additional stuff
2016-02-23 17:31:57	michaelrose	no that would be contrary to the entire concept of it being just a wm

2016-02-23 22:12:53	michaelrose	sliptonic, the i3 docs cover which criteria you may use and you may use more than one if you need to narrow it down separated by spaces
2016-02-23 22:13:27	michaelrose	sliptonic, nope all for_window should be on their own line
2016-02-23 22:13:55	michaelrose	note that do something could be i3 commands or it can execute a script
2016-02-23 22:14:45	michaelrose	for example for_window [class=Firefox] exec myscript.sh

2016-02-23 22:20:29	michaelrose	also note that you could just make a keybinding to move ANY window to said position and such a size
2016-02-23 22:20:58	sliptonic	A keybinding would be ideal.  I was looking at example 2 but not clear if it only applies to floating windows.
2016-02-23 22:21:18	michaelrose	absolutely it does
2016-02-23 22:21:29	michaelrose	you can't just move stuff around thats tiled you shift it in the layout
2016-02-23 22:21:48	sliptonic	That makes sense.  I think I've got a sense for it now.  Thanks!
2016-02-23 22:22:28	michaelrose	a simple example bindsym foo move absolute position x y, resize set x y
2016-02-23 22:23:15	michaelrose	btw I assume you are making a screencast and want the webcam view of you to be in a certain spot?
2016-02-23 22:23:58	michaelrose	if you want the floating window to show up on all workspaces you would need to set it sticky

2016-02-24 23:57:56	f8l	Looks nice. I might do something similar, but with the title on i3bar displayed by i3status wrapper.
2016-02-25 00:06:25	jellytux	any idea on how to set the fontsize for the confirmation messages?
2016-02-25 00:06:53	f8l	What confirmation messages?
2016-02-25 00:06:55	jellytux	ah
2016-02-25 00:07:10	jellytux	i3-nagbar, could probably find something on google, sorry (new to i3)
2016-02-25 00:07:33	f8l	man i3-nagbar then.
2016-02-25 00:08:55	daniel_j	looking to get 2 windows side-by-side across the top and one at the bottom taking up the width of the two on top
2016-02-25 00:09:01	daniel_j	last resort is #i3 ;~;
2016-02-25 00:09:13	daniel_j	can't wrap my head around the v/h splitting lol
2016-02-25 00:09:55	f8l	So don’t. Just drag the window down, and you are done.
2016-02-25 00:10:48	daniel_j	nah i get the height part, but i'm after 2 windows on the top half of the screen, at mthey're all stacked ontop of each other, lol
2016-02-25 00:11:11	daniel_j	i get it eventually
2016-02-25 00:11:13	jellytux	doesn't say what format it wants --font "<formatting?>" tried the same as i3wm's config
2016-02-25 00:11:14	daniel_j	but only by luck, lol
2016-02-25 00:11:23	f8l	There is a video tutorial somewhere on the web page.
2016-02-25 00:11:49	daniel_j	yeah giving a look for it now heh
2016-02-25 00:13:08	daniel_j	ohhh i got it
2016-02-25 00:13:13	daniel_j	so damn simple in the end >_<
2016-02-25 00:13:20	f8l	jellytux: It may be the X font description format, but I’m not sure.
2016-02-25 00:13:57	f8l	daniel_j: Yes, it is simple, but takes a bit of practice.
2016-02-25 00:13:59	jellytux	f8l: fixed it, was another unexpected message, probably have to store the font in ~/.config/i3-nagbar/config?
2016-02-25 00:14:16	daniel_j	lol it sure does, thanks for the input though ;)
2016-02-25 00:15:49	jellytux	nope that didn't work :(
2016-02-25 00:17:32	jellytux	yay, `nagbar { font ...}` works in i3wm's config file
2016-02-25 00:18:49	f8l	daniel_j: Try to place three windows side by side and then move one of them down.
2016-02-25 00:19:07	f8l	jellytux: I wasn’t aware of that.
2016-02-25 00:19:55	jellytux	f8l: oh noes, it just gave me an error fixing the font at the same time :(

2016-02-25 00:25:02	f8l	Manpage says you should use ‘-f ‹font›’.
2016-02-25 00:25:48	jellytux	f8l: yep, but if the i3wm config gives an error, it doesn't seem like I can control that
2016-02-25 00:25:56	jellytux	f8l: unless if I modify the source perhaps
2016-02-25 00:27:07	f8l	How are you trying to change the font?
2016-02-25 00:27:13	jellytux	hmm, would be nice to be able to rename your workspace as well
2016-02-25 00:27:28	f8l	You can.
2016-02-25 00:27:57	jellytux	f8l: well I set the font to 0 size remember? So the messages sprung from i3wm (such as the error message) will use 0px font
2016-02-25 00:28:41	jellytux	f8l: the message prompt for closing i3wm is something I could obviously control since it is within the config
2016-02-25 00:29:20	jellytux	f8l: rename the workspace whilst inside of i3wm without modifying the config (like tmux)?
2016-02-25 00:29:47	f8l	I don’t know what you are talking about.
2016-02-25 00:30:52	f8l	Run ‘i3 workspace whatever’.
2016-02-25 00:30:54	jellytux	f8l: i3-nagbar: if I get an error in my config, and restart i3wm then i3wm will execute i3-nagbar (probably hardcoded)
2016-02-25 00:32:31	jellytux	f8l: for changing workspace name: e.g <Mod+5><Mod+,>my_name
2016-02-25 00:32:43	f8l	Yes, that’s true, but ¨the other two things are what I don’t get.
2016-02-25 00:32:44	jellytux	^ workspace 5 will now change name to my_name
2016-02-25 00:34:14	jellytux	f8l: sometimes my workspaces changes name as time passes

2016-02-25 00:41:21	f8l	jellytux: Is the 0-size nagbar visible? If so, you don’t have to worry about the font. Whenever you see it, it means you have an error in your configuration. The purpose of nagbar is to make you get rid of it. ;-)

2016-02-26 17:40:04	foolishmonkey	giacomos, how can I install it with a custom prefix?
2016-02-26 17:40:33	giacomos	foolishmonkey: good question...I think I will add a cli parameter for that

2016-02-26 17:41:37	armin	Somelauw: tmux has "truecolor"? wat?
2016-02-26 17:41:51	indeedwatson	Somelauw: well tabs and multiple terminals are handled by i3 already
2016-02-26 17:42:12	armin	Somelauw: it does have 256 color support if you set $TERM accordingly. it has nothing to do with alpha transparency of your terminal emulator or millions of colors, though.

2016-02-28 10:46:56	osse	Hmm, maybe there's a race going on. Should I put my execs into the i3-msg itself? I just put them after exec i3-msg in the config file

2016-02-28 17:17:56	parsnip	what process can i check that feh set wallpaper? 
2016-02-28 17:18:23	parsnip	i want to make sure that i set it at least once, as well as not too often :(
2016-02-28 17:18:53	parsnip	(trying exec in ~/.i3/config, but having some trouble.)
2016-02-28 17:22:13	Airblader	parsnip: You can check ~/.fehbg
2016-02-28 17:23:43	parsnip	Airblader: ah, so to check, i can try emptying it, and then doing whatever i'm hoping invokes the background? 
2016-02-28 17:23:46	indeedwatson	do most people here use htop?
2016-02-28 17:24:02	nemeci	sometimes
2016-02-28 17:24:18	Airblader	parsnip: Yeah. When feh is executed, it will create that file. See "man feh".
2016-02-28 17:24:36	parsnip	i have the feh command in .i3/config as an exec, but rebooting didn't seem to invoke the wallpaper, but doing s+S+r did. 
2016-02-28 17:24:56	f8l	indeedwatson: I doubt it. Why do you ask?
2016-02-28 17:25:02	Airblader	parsnip: s+S+r?
2016-02-28 17:26:00	parsnip	um, mod+shift+r
2016-02-28 17:26:14	parsnip	i think feloads .i3/config
2016-02-28 17:26:18	parsnip	*reloads
2016-02-28 17:26:49	Airblader	parsnip: Neither a config reload nor an in-place restart triggers "exec" in the i3 config. You can use exec_always, which will trigger on in-place restarts (but not config reloads).
2016-02-28 17:27:05	Airblader	parsnip: A reboot should of course trigger both.
2016-02-28 17:27:24	Airblader	parsnip: But if you use "exec" and an in-place restart fixed it, then it can't have been due to the "exec" command.
2016-02-28 17:27:43	indeedwatson	f8l: just curious what task manager people use with i3
2016-02-28 17:28:44	f8l	indeedwatson: Is i3 a limiting factor here? I guess you can use whichever you like.
2016-02-28 17:28:58	parsnip	Airblader: yes, i was tryin exec_always

2016-03-01 14:03:32	geosmin	Airblader: was thinking of toying with your fork of i3blocks to get a transparent i3bar
2016-03-01 14:04:19	Airblader	geosmin: For the transparency of the bar you don't necessarily need i3blocks-gaps, just i3-gaps-next.
2016-03-01 14:04:48	Airblader	geosmin: The i3blocks fork is only necessary if for example you want to use the blocklet borders.
2016-03-01 14:05:03	Airblader	geosmin: But yeah, just go for it :)
2016-03-01 14:05:11	geosmin	Airblader: i'm not sure what i want exactly yet
2016-03-01 14:05:27	geosmin	what i'd like to try is maybe not have a bar per se but a rectangle behind each item?
2016-03-01 14:05:43	geosmin	that might be ugly
2016-03-01 14:05:56	Airblader	geosmin: Sure. Just use full transparency of the i3bar background and set a border for each blocklet. Not my kind of style, but who knows. :)

2016-03-01 14:41:24	Merdrod	Is it possible to put on sleep or hibernate my computer using i3?
2016-03-01 14:42:47	Airblader	Merdrod: Yes, because sleep/hibernate has nothing to do with the window manager you use.
2016-03-01 14:43:24	Airblader	Merdrod: Unlike a full DE, a simple WM like i3 won't give you tools for it, though. Just check out the ArchWiki page on these topics to find out how to do it.
2016-03-01 14:44:18	Merdrod	Ok, so I've already checked that, I was just wondering maybe I was missing something like a shortcut

2016-03-01 17:50:16	Airblader	Because home–work takes me one hour. On crowded trains. And I only have one train line that reaches to my station and Munich sucks and the public transportation fails quite often.
2016-03-01 17:50:29	qball	same here
2016-03-01 17:50:33	qball	but still I can sit and work
2016-03-01 17:50:37	Airblader	So if the line I need doesn't go all I can do is wait.

2016-03-01 18:04:42	Airblader	I love maim + slop because selecting what to screenshot is terrific and not as glitchy as with scrot

2016-03-01 18:06:09	Chicken_Wrap	Anything other reason to use maim over scrot?

2016-03-01 18:07:03	Chicken_Wrap	The selection option works out of the box?
2016-03-01 18:07:44	Airblader	Chicken_Wrap: Yes, but even better if you install slop as well (also works out of the box then)
2016-03-01 18:08:05	Airblader	f8l: Things like how the border of the selection is drawn. Color, padding, thickness, …

2016-03-01 18:09:18	f8l	I don’t even know what slop is.
2016-03-01 18:09:51	Chicken_Wrap	" slop (Select Operation) is an application that queries for a selection from the user and prints the region to stdout. "
2016-03-01 18:10:17	Chicken_Wrap	Plus the name is fun to say.

2016-03-01 18:11:57	Airblader	Which of course we discourage *cough*

2016-03-04 14:46:27	SardemFF7	if notify-send works, then the issue sure is on deluge’s side :-)
2016-03-04 14:47:01	michaelrose	one would think the package would handle required deps
2016-03-04 14:47:27	markthedark	well ok, it's not just deluge i guess, haven't noticed any notifications, got dropbox, skype running.. 
2016-03-04 14:48:44	SardemFF7	skype is not using libnotify IIRC
2016-03-04 14:49:00	SardemFF7	dropbox I don’t know, but they may be using python too, so pynotify :-)
2016-03-04 14:49:31	markthedark	k, i'll see in moment if pynotify will fix the issues.

2016-03-04 16:11:39	redproto	I'm using "Control+Mod1" (ctrl+alt) as my mod key for i3 on several machines. It doesn't work for particular keybindings. On one of my machines, i3 works with ctrl+alt+shift+2 but not ctrl+alt+2. On another machine, i3 works with ctrl+alt+2 but not with ctrl+alt+shift+2 (move window to workspace). Is there a reason why these keybindings are inconsistently doing nothing on certain machines?

2016-03-04 16:13:39	indeedwatson	redproto: i had similar problems that a particular combination of keys didn't work, it was a long time ago but from what i recall, it was an odd problem with the keyboard, not i3
2016-03-04 16:15:48	redproto	Hmm interesting. However, in my case, each machine is a laptop of a different make / model. I would think it unlikely that both keyboards have some malfunction

2016-03-04 16:18:28	redproto	SardemFF7: That may be the reason to explain the inconsistency between machines, but note that both machines are not functioning properly -- just in different ways. ctrl+alt+2 or ctrl+alt+shift+2 are just not working. Is it possible that something else is "eating" these keybord shortcuts before i3 has a chance to process them? If so, is there any way I can debug this, since the keys seemingly don't launch anything user visible?
2016-03-04 16:19:44	SardemFF7	redproto: The difference between "shift+2" and "2" is really number-specific
2016-03-04 16:19:58	SardemFF7	number-shift-specific actually

2016-03-04 16:24:06	qball	depending on how parsed
2016-03-04 16:25:18	SardemFF7	with a really old Xlib-based i3 it can be completely different
2016-03-04 16:25:32	SardemFF7	with or without libxkbcommon is relevant too
2016-03-04 16:25:56	SardemFF7	the X server supporting XKB or not too
2016-03-04 16:27:12	redproto	SardemFF7, qball: I tried defining as both "ctrl+alt+shift+@" and "ctrl+alt+@" and neither work, unfortunately. Both versions of i3 are recent (not more than 2 months old). I will read up on libxkbcommon-- thanks. Not sure what that is exactly.

2016-03-04 20:24:30	ArchNoob	Hello, somedays ago i asked about my Acute key not working. This has been going on for forever eversince. I've tried to change my i3 configurations even wiping them to almost nothing and the behaviour is the same. When i press shift and acute the tilde works but acute it self nothing displays. Please need some help, this only happens in i3 and everysince i switched to Archlinux with same config.

2016-03-04 20:38:12	Airblader	somis: NarwhalX: sway is not "i3 with Wayland". sway is a completely new wm (actually, a Wayland compositor) that just mimicks i3 and is config-compatible. It is not affiliated with i3 at all.
2016-03-04 20:38:27	Airblader	NarwhalX: And no, there are no plans whatsoever to port i3 to Wayland. It's just not worth the effort.

2016-03-04 20:40:25	armin	Airblader: so you're obviously the guy who made the branch of i3 i'm using right now

2016-03-04 20:41:32	armin	Airblader: like i have a seperate branch that has yours as upstream
2016-03-04 20:41:42	armin	Airblader: and yes it's the i3-gaps branch on your side.

2016-03-04 20:54:11	armin	Airblader: michael already allowed us to let us print the initial i3 shirts that ever existed, so probably not.
2016-03-04 20:54:29	armin	Airblader: he would just like the fact that we fork.
2016-03-04 20:54:56	armin	he has strong decisions about that to merge and what not, and i don't see any reason to question that.
2016-03-04 20:55:21	armin	his decisions have proven to be not the worst. even if he likes systemd.
2016-03-04 20:55:30	Airblader	I can't say I always agree with him, but when it comes to not wanting to merge i3-gaps into i3, I fully agree with him.
2016-03-04 20:55:46	armin	exactly my thoughts.
2016-03-04 20:56:22	armin	i don't always agree with him.
2016-03-04 20:56:28	armin	i still value him. a lot.
2016-03-04 20:56:51	foolishmonkey	he is alone maintaining i3?
2016-03-04 20:57:12	armin	i think so
2016-03-04 20:57:31	Airblader	foolishmonkey: Well, mostly Michael and me. We have a separation on what I can and can't do, of course.
2016-03-04 20:57:55	Airblader	foolishmonkey: There's a third collaborator but he's rather busy lately.
2016-03-04 20:58:01	foolishmonkey	what you can't do? are you talking about integrating features?
2016-03-04 20:58:30	Airblader	foolishmonkey: Yes. I never merge code myself, that's only for Michael to do.
2016-03-04 20:58:35	foolishmonkey	OK
2016-03-04 20:58:42	foolishmonkey	so he is responsible
2016-03-04 20:58:49	armin	thing is, michael never had the aim to let i3 look good.
2016-03-04 20:58:58	foolishmonkey	i3 dos look good
2016-03-04 20:58:59	armin	the first thing was: make it usable.
2016-03-04 20:59:07	armin	it sure does look good.
2016-03-04 20:59:14	Airblader	foolishmonkey: I do also review pull requests and I typically maintain issues more actively than he does.
2016-03-04 20:59:31	Airblader	Well my intention is to make i3 look better. :)
2016-03-04 20:59:37	armin	so, now people decide they want fancy transparency and whatnot and throw compositing managers into the mix. what should michael do?
2016-03-04 20:59:48	foolishmonkey	a pull request? it's when someone want to submit a patch?
2016-03-04 21:00:02	armin	the thing is that our minds diverse here.
2016-03-04 21:00:07	Airblader	armin: i3 will never do compositing, but nothing stops you from running a compositor. Many people already do.
2016-03-04 21:00:24	armin	Airblader: i3 does compositing pretty well with a standalone compositor.
2016-03-04 21:00:26	Airblader	armin: And I am actively pushing for transparency support
2016-03-04 21:00:41	Airblader	foolishmonkey: Yes

2016-03-04 21:01:06	armin	Airblader: that's the script i use to dynamically just switch transparency on and off while i work
2016-03-04 21:01:23	Airblader	armin: I know, I use compositing myself, too. Which is also why I keep improving it.
2016-03-04 21:01:42	Airblader	armin: My compositing is always on. I see no reason to turn it off ever.
2016-03-04 21:01:42	armin	Airblader: you use compton?
2016-03-04 21:01:46	Airblader	armin: Yeah

2016-03-04 21:02:15	Airblader	foolishmonkey: Well for example i3 draws decorations in a really unusual way which doesn't play nice with compositors.
2016-03-04 21:02:32	foolishmonkey	what do you call a compositor?

2016-03-04 21:07:28	foolishmonkey	a transparent layer
2016-03-04 21:07:37	armin	bascially, kind of.
2016-03-04 21:07:41	armin	yes.
2016-03-04 21:07:41	foolishmonkey	OK
2016-03-04 21:07:47	foolishmonkey	never use such a thing
2016-03-04 21:07:57	foolishmonkey	I'm happy with my stock i3
2016-03-04 21:07:57	armin	thing is
2016-03-04 21:08:14	armin	X was never designed to look appealing to humans 20 years later.
2016-03-04 21:08:35	Airblader	armin: That statement makes no sense
2016-03-04 21:08:36	foolishmonkey	I used twm for years :D and was happy with him
2016-03-04 21:08:47	foolishmonkey	s/him/it/
2016-03-04 21:08:49	armin	it was designed to draw square rectangular surfaces, black or white, with letters on it.
2016-03-04 21:08:50	Airblader	armin: X has nothing to do with how something looks. X was explicitly designed to not impose a look and feel.
2016-03-04 21:09:27	armin	Airblader: well the whole compositing thing on top is something X was never built for.
2016-03-04 21:09:54	armin	Airblader: it's basically a dirty hack to make linux users feel a bit more at home with a bit of animations.
2016-03-04 21:10:25	armin	Airblader: well, not really actually, but still.
2016-03-04 21:11:23	armin	Airblader: i mean, when X was made, there were surfaces, letters, maybe graphics. nobody would have thought of true transparency back in those days, we were happy to be able to click things.
2016-03-04 21:11:49	Airblader	armin: I really honestly don't understand why you are saying all these things. No one was arguing about this. foolishmonkey asked what a compositor is. That's all.
2016-03-04 21:12:02	foolishmonkey	:D
2016-03-04 21:12:12	armin	i'm not sober, my apologies.
2016-03-04 21:12:12	foolishmonkey	maybe she/he is lonely
2016-03-04 21:12:22	armin	nah
2016-03-04 21:12:26	armin	g/f is sleeping
2016-03-04 21:12:34	armin	so time for some hacking
2016-03-04 21:12:40	armin	and taking drugs, obviously.
2016-03-04 21:12:52	armin	shame on me.
2016-03-04 21:13:07	Airblader	armin: Get some sleep and when you wake up you can maybe update i3.
2016-03-04 21:13:09	armin	cheers.
2016-03-04 21:13:09	Airblader	armin: ;)
2016-03-04 21:13:34	armin	Airblader: well i actually am root. no matter the time.
2016-03-04 21:13:53	Airblader	armin: That was supposed to be a subtle hint that 4.12 is coming.
2016-03-04 21:13:56	armin	Airblader: anyways, love your work.
2016-03-04 21:15:03	armin	Airblader: feels good to use, and is rock solid stable as long as you keep the 2px border thing in your config.
2016-03-04 21:15:22	armin	Airblader: i work with it every day.
2016-03-04 21:15:23	Airblader	armin: … which is a constraint I am trying to get rid of.
2016-03-04 21:15:36	armin	Airblader: why so?
2016-03-04 21:15:41	Airblader	armin: With 4.12 using titlebars with gaps already works a lot better, but not entirely glitch-free quite yet.
2016-03-04 21:15:42	armin	Airblader: you miss your terminal titles?
2016-03-04 21:15:55	Airblader	armin: I personally don't use them, no.

2016-03-04 21:17:16	armin	Airblader: but they still get out of place of what i'm actually doingö.
2016-03-04 21:17:18	Airblader	armin: I used to do that, but recently got rid of it.
2016-03-04 21:17:25	armin	Airblader: why so?
2016-03-04 21:17:27	Airblader	armin: As a tip, using xtitle -s is a whole lot easier.
2016-03-04 21:17:37	armin	oh
2016-03-04 21:17:42	Airblader	armin: In i3blocks you can configure it as a persistent block and et voila.
2016-03-04 21:17:47	armin	thank you!
2016-03-04 21:18:20	Airblader	I removed it because I found that I don't really ever need the information. So why bother keeping it around.
2016-03-04 21:18:52	armin	Airblader: yeah, those are the urban decays of the last months of using i3-gaps as my primary wm...
2016-03-04 21:18:55	armin	:D
2016-03-04 21:19:49	armin	Airblader: but really, i use it, and i encourage people to give it a try a lot. keep up the good work.
2016-03-04 21:20:01	Airblader	armin: Thanks. :)
2016-03-04 21:20:19	Airblader	armin: Let's hope you'll like 4.12, too. ;)

2016-03-04 21:21:22	Airblader	armin: Well 4.12 is about to ship, the testing is pretty much done. Anyone can test if they want, simply by running the development branch.
2016-03-04 21:21:31	Airblader	armin: We don't have a "freeze" that we then test for a while.
2016-03-04 21:22:06	armin	Airblader: are you referencing to remotes/origin/gaps-next ?
2016-03-04 21:22:11	Airblader	armin: Yes
2016-03-04 21:22:16	armin	gotcha

2016-03-04 21:24:10	Airblader	lol
2016-03-04 21:24:19	Simbaclaws	hello everyone, I'm having a little issue with my i3bar on the i3gaps fork of i3wm
2016-03-04 21:24:29	Airblader	Simbaclaws: What's the issue
2016-03-04 21:24:40	armin	Airblader: by the way, can i have transparent i3bar=
2016-03-04 21:24:53	Simbaclaws	apparently the transparency of my bar doesn't work. in the bar block inside my config I have set i3bar_command to i3bar -t
2016-03-04 21:24:58	Airblader	armin: Yes, check out the README. You need to be using gaps-next for this, though. Or wait until 4.12 ships.
2016-03-04 21:25:03	armin	Airblader: i think i can remember you told me that's possible months ago.
2016-03-04 21:25:10	armin	Airblader: word.
2016-03-04 21:25:15	Airblader	Simbaclaws: Are you running gaps-next and are you running a compositor?
2016-03-04 21:25:16	Simbaclaws	but this will not display the bar and will cause a lot of different collors and strange stretching to appear in my bar
2016-03-04 21:25:39	armin	Airblader: and there's another thing that i wanted to ask you about. window decorations.
2016-03-04 21:25:46	Simbaclaws	I'm not sure if I'm running gaps-next, I am using this: https://github.com/Airblader/i3
2016-03-04 21:25:47		[ http://is.gd/Y3H6fD ]
2016-03-04 21:25:55	Simbaclaws	and I'm using compton
2016-03-04 21:25:55	Airblader	Simbaclaws: How did you install i3-gaps?
2016-03-04 21:26:02	Simbaclaws	by building it from source
2016-03-04 21:26:09	Airblader	Simbaclaws: Which branch? gaps or gaps-next?
2016-03-04 21:26:14	Simbaclaws	I did get all the dependencies beforehand

2016-03-04 21:26:26	armin	Airblader: thing is we could easily utilize X11s ability to draw gradients.
2016-03-04 21:26:35	armin	Airblader: without any performance loss.
2016-03-04 21:26:38	Simbaclaws	git clone https://www.github.com/Airblader/i3
2016-03-04 21:26:39		[ http://is.gd/13qm8M ]
2016-03-04 21:26:47	Simbaclaws	so I suppose gaps? and not gaps-next?
2016-03-04 21:26:50	Simbaclaws	or...?
2016-03-04 21:26:54	Simbaclaws	this was in the wiki...
2016-03-04 21:27:19	armin	Airblader: which would easily add a nice 3d effect to bars and decorations, too.
2016-03-04 21:27:44	armin	Airblader: oh, and there's ANOTHER thing i have to annoy you with.
2016-03-04 21:28:20	armin	Airblader: which is, actually, questioning the idea of a full manual tiling wm in its own.
2016-03-04 21:28:29	armin	Airblader: but, still.
2016-03-04 21:28:38	Airblader	Simbaclaws: What happens if you run "i3bar -t --bar_id=bar-0" from a terminal?
2016-03-04 21:28:44		redproto has quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
2016-03-04 21:28:49	Simbaclaws	it displays invalid options -t
2016-03-04 21:29:11	Airblader	Simbaclaws: Then you're either not using the correct branch or when you built it from source, this didn't exist yet.
2016-03-04 21:29:30	Airblader	Simbaclaws: Just compile it again and make sure you use gaps-next
2016-03-04 21:29:41	armin	Airblader: like, if you have already splitted vertically for 3 times, then chances are good you do NOT want the next window to be split in the same manner.
2016-03-04 21:29:46	Simbaclaws	which is the github link to gaps-next?
2016-03-04 21:30:03	Simbaclaws	also if I compile gaps-next will this automatically overwrite my current gaps install?
2016-03-04 21:30:03	Airblader	Simbaclaws: Same repository, just a different branch
2016-03-04 21:30:18	Airblader	Simbaclaws: When you clone the repository just issue "git checkout gaps-next" before compiling
2016-03-04 21:30:34	Airblader	Simbaclaws: And if you installed with "make install" before, then yes, it will just update your install
2016-03-04 21:30:40	armin	>  ~/git/i3.airblader [gaps-next] 141  git remote -v

2016-03-04 21:30:44	Airblader	Simbaclaws: Of course you need to restart i3 after
2016-03-04 21:30:46	Simbaclaws	ok good thanks
2016-03-04 21:31:16	Airblader	armin: "Chances are" is a pretty weak argument
2016-03-04 21:31:27	Airblader	armin: You can modify this behavior by using the IPC
2016-03-04 21:31:34	armin	Airblader: it's not.
2016-03-04 21:31:45	Airblader	armin: Yes, it is.
2016-03-04 21:31:55	Airblader	armin: Chances are that that is the case for you, but not many others.
2016-03-04 21:32:03	armin	Airblader: splitting algorithms are actually influenced by this, mathematical structures are, etc.
2016-03-04 21:32:10	Airblader	armin: Chances are for you the limit is 4, for me it's 2, for someone else it's 10
2016-03-04 21:32:12	Simbaclaws	ok now the branch says gaps-next instead of master
2016-03-04 21:32:17	Simbaclaws	in my terminal
2016-03-04 21:32:24	armin	Airblader: exactly, then make this configurable.
2016-03-04 21:32:40	armin	Airblader: like an auto split or something.
2016-03-04 21:32:54	Airblader	armin: That's a really ugly feature, but again, just write an IPC script to modify it to your liking
2016-03-04 21:33:07	Airblader	Simbaclaws: Great, now "make && sudo make install"
2016-03-04 21:33:18	Simbaclaws	I think my problem was that I blindly followed the wiki there it says you should do git checkout gaps
2016-03-04 21:33:32	armin	Airblader: it would kind of mimic the thought of bspwm in a way, if done correct.
2016-03-04 21:33:33	Airblader	Simbaclaws: Yes, because gaps is the "stable" branch.
2016-03-04 21:33:39	Simbaclaws	ah ok
2016-03-04 21:33:52	armin	Airblader: or a lot of other "more or less automatic" tiling wm's.
2016-03-04 21:33:57	Airblader	armin: We don't want to mimic bspwm. If you want bspwm, use bspwm. ;)
2016-03-04 21:34:11	armin	Airblader: see, that's where our minds diverse.
2016-03-04 21:34:39	Simbaclaws	okay I'm gonna logout and login again, see if it changed anything. Be right back

2016-03-04 21:35:04	armin	Airblader: another thing. maximized windows and dialogs.
2016-03-04 21:35:20	armin	Airblader: i want more influence possibilities for such cases.
2016-03-04 21:35:30	Airblader	armin: Maximized windows… do you mean fullscreen?

2016-03-04 21:36:04	Simbaclaws	thanks a lot Airblader, it's transparent now :)
2016-03-04 21:36:11	Simbaclaws	oh yeah xD
2016-03-04 21:36:23	Airblader	Simbaclaws: Great :)
2016-03-04 21:36:51	Simbaclaws	Thanks for all the help, now I just need to get my bar to look a bit like your screenshot, I'd love to have it like that
2016-03-04 21:37:03	Airblader	Simbaclaws: Feel free to look at my dotfiles
2016-03-04 21:37:05	Simbaclaws	I copied some of your dot files but it's not showing up as it is in the screenshot
2016-03-04 21:37:17	armin	Airblader: that was one thing that really annoys me.
2016-03-04 21:37:19	Airblader	Simbaclaws: Well you need to know which stuff to look at… :)
2016-03-04 21:37:30	Simbaclaws	I suppose the bar block? :S
2016-03-04 21:37:30	armin	Airblader: about i3 in general, that is.
2016-03-04 21:37:42	Airblader	armin: Well you just mentioned like five different things.
2016-03-04 21:37:47	Simbaclaws	I'm actually incredibly new to i3, installed it for the first time today
2016-03-04 21:38:02	armin	Airblader: as i said i'm not sober, forgive me please.
2016-03-04 21:38:06	Airblader	armin: I have no idea what you want a "maximized window" to be, nor what "dialog" is supposed to tell me. :)
2016-03-04 21:38:25	armin	Airblader: ah okay. so think "fullscreen".
2016-03-04 21:38:34	Airblader	Simbaclaws: The bar block is one thing, yes.
2016-03-04 21:38:53	armin	Airblader: say you use a graphical file manager fullscreen.
2016-03-04 21:39:03	Airblader	Simbaclaws: I use i3blocks (instead of i3status), and to have i3blocks be able to configure the borders on the status blocks, you need to use my fork i3blocks-gaps here, too.
2016-03-04 21:39:14	jpleau	http://i.imgur.com/NoMox5B.png -> if the i3bar isn't using transparency, is there anything blocking me from having the tray icons using i3bar's background instead of being fully transparent?
2016-03-04 21:39:17	armin	Airblader: you hit enter on something, a "enter new filename: " window appears
2016-03-04 21:39:22	armin	Airblader: but you would never see it
2016-03-04 21:39:33	armin	Airblader: get the idea?
2016-03-04 21:39:41	Simbaclaws	hmm ok so I have to compile yet another branch :P?
2016-03-04 21:40:02	Simbaclaws	oh it's not in there
2016-03-04 21:40:18	Airblader	Simbaclaws: i3blocks-gaps is a separate repository, it's a fork of i3blocks
2016-03-04 21:40:33	Airblader	jpleau: I don't understand your question
2016-03-04 21:40:34	Simbaclaws	ah ok thanks a lot I'll go check it out right away
2016-03-04 21:40:41	armin	Airblader: like there should be a hint that tells the window manager to let hold of the fullscreen state in such a case?
2016-03-04 21:40:56	Airblader	armin: There is
2016-03-04 21:41:04	Airblader	armin: And i3 has popup_during_fullscreen for it
2016-03-04 21:41:05	armin	Airblader: but?
2016-03-04 21:41:09	jpleau	Airblader: maybe it's not completely clear in the screenshot, but notice how the "background" of my tray icons are different from my bar's background. Afaik those tray icons png files, and their "background" is transparent
2016-03-04 21:41:14	armin	ah
2016-03-04 21:41:15	Airblader	armin: It just requires the application to set the proper hints
2016-03-04 21:41:27	armin	ah
2016-03-04 21:41:56	armin	Airblader: hmmmm. 
2016-03-04 21:41:58	Airblader	armin: You can easily "fake" maximizing a window by simply moving it to a separate workspace, though, if you don't want to use fullscreen
2016-03-04 21:42:16	armin	Airblader: that's what i do a lot
2016-03-04 21:42:27	Airblader	jpleau: Can I see your i3 config?
2016-03-04 21:42:51	jpleau	Airblader: yes hang on
2016-03-04 21:42:58	Simbaclaws	Airblader, should I do a git checkout i3blocks-gaps?
2016-03-04 21:43:18	Simbaclaws	I did a git clone of the i3blocks-gaps.git
2016-03-04 21:43:19	Airblader	Simbaclaws: No, i3blocks-gaps is a *repository*, not a branch
2016-03-04 21:43:25	Simbaclaws	oh yeah sorry xD
2016-03-04 21:43:30	Simbaclaws	excuse me
2016-03-04 21:43:34	Airblader	Simbaclaws: Cloning was the right step, yes
2016-03-04 21:43:42	Airblader	Simbaclaws: Using the master branch is fine here
2016-03-04 21:43:42	Simbaclaws	make clean all?
2016-03-04 21:43:58	Airblader	Simbaclaws: Yes, then make install
2016-03-04 21:44:05	Airblader	Simbaclaws: What distro do you use?
2016-03-04 21:44:10	Simbaclaws	ronn -w -r i3blocks.1.ronn

2016-03-04 21:44:32	Airblader	Simbaclaws: Well you're missing dependencies
2016-03-04 21:44:38	jpleau	Airblader: thanks. I was actually running i3bar -t ... sigh :(
2016-03-04 21:44:39	Airblader	Simbaclaws: As a tip, just apt-get install i3blocks
2016-03-04 21:45:01	Airblader	Simbaclaws: That'll take care of all dependencies
2016-03-04 21:45:06	jpleau	that won't work
2016-03-04 21:45:09	Airblader	Simbaclaws: Then just compile again
2016-03-04 21:45:09	Simbaclaws	unable to locate package i3blocks :/
2016-03-04 21:45:15	armin	nooooooooo
2016-03-04 21:45:26	Airblader	Simbaclaws: Well, then install the dependencies yourself, I guess. :)
2016-03-04 21:45:42	Simbaclaws	where do I check which dependencies I need?
2016-03-04 21:45:45	armin	i3blocks was not found, all hell will break loose now!
2016-03-04 21:45:46	Airblader	jpleau: Yeah. If you use -t, the trays will not use the i3bar background
2016-03-04 21:45:48	armin	wheeeeeeeee
2016-03-04 21:45:49	Simbaclaws	I can't find them in the doc on github
2016-03-04 21:46:02	Airblader	Simbaclaws: Not all projects document them.
2016-03-04 21:46:08	Airblader	Simbaclaws: Just google "Linux Mint ronn" or something
2016-03-04 21:46:13	Simbaclaws	ok
2016-03-04 21:46:14		foolishmonkey has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2016-03-04 21:46:22	Airblader	Simbaclaws: Or use apt-cache whatever to figure out which package provides that
2016-03-04 21:46:35	Airblader	Simbaclaws: Not too sure on the commands, I don't use a distro with such broken package management… :)
2016-03-04 21:46:39	armin	apt-file search i3blocks
2016-03-04 21:46:42	Simbaclaws	you mean as in ruby-ronn?
2016-03-04 21:46:55	Simbaclaws	that's the first hit I'm getting from linux mint community

2016-03-04 21:47:03	jpleau	Simbaclaws: http://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/collab-maint/i3blocks.git/tree/debian/control there you are for the dependencies to build i3blocks, you just need ruby-ronn and a C compiler
2016-03-04 21:47:04		[ http://is.gd/juk57r ]
2016-03-04 21:47:14	jpleau	if you build from git I think vivien also made ronn an optionnal dependency
2016-03-04 21:47:19	Simbaclaws	ah good thanks jpleau
2016-03-04 21:47:36	armin	linuxmint is dead.
2016-03-04 21:47:44	armin	just move on
2016-03-04 21:47:51	Simbaclaws	installing ruby-ronn
2016-03-04 21:48:01	Simbaclaws	that one is in the repo's but i3blocks isn't xD
2016-03-04 21:48:38	Simbaclaws	ok installation seems to have worked
2016-03-04 21:48:41	armin	see, priorities...
2016-03-04 21:48:45	jpleau	Simbaclaws: not sure how linux mint imports their package, but ubuntu imported it in time for 15.04
2016-03-04 21:49:10	Simbaclaws	I think it's still based on 14.04 ubuntu LTS
2016-03-04 21:49:12	Simbaclaws	but I'm not sure
2016-03-04 21:49:19	jpleau	Airblader: I was certain I was running i3bar without -t, but you wanting to see my config made me feel something was odd with it hehe.
2016-03-04 21:49:33	Simbaclaws	hmmm odd, nothing has changed
2016-03-04 21:49:37	Airblader	jpleau: Yeah, I figured that was gonna be the problem. :)
2016-03-04 21:49:37	Simbaclaws	I should do i3 restart right?
2016-03-04 21:49:52	jpleau	Simbaclaws: you have to tell i3 to use i3blocks instead of i3status
2016-03-04 21:49:55	Airblader	Simbaclaws: Installing i3blocks without doing anything isn't gonna change anything
2016-03-04 21:50:04	Simbaclaws	yeah I have that in my bar block code
2016-03-04 21:50:18	jpleau	https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks see the Usage section
2016-03-04 21:50:19		[ http://is.gd/HlViak ]
2016-03-04 21:50:26	Airblader	jpleau: The background thing for tray icons sucks, but it's just an unfortunate limitation of the messed up XEMBED protocol
2016-03-04 21:50:39	Simbaclaws	status_command i3blocks
2016-03-04 21:50:50	Simbaclaws	right?
2016-03-04 21:50:54	Airblader	Sim Yes
2016-03-04 21:50:56	Airblader	Simbaclaws: *Yes
2016-03-04 21:51:05	Airblader	Simbaclaws: And you also need an i3blocks config.
2016-03-04 21:51:08	jpleau	Airblader: Yes I realize if I wanted to have a transparent bar that would be really unfortunate. Not gonna complain though it's barely noticeable 
2016-03-04 21:51:11	Simbaclaws	well it's in the configuration so why is it still looking as a default i3blocks install?
2016-03-04 21:51:15	Simbaclaws	ooooh
2016-03-04 21:51:17	Simbaclaws	that's hy
2016-03-04 21:51:18	Simbaclaws	why
2016-03-04 21:51:20	Simbaclaws	:P
2016-03-04 21:51:26	Airblader	jpleau: I'm happy that with my wallpaper it's not visible at all. :)
2016-03-04 21:51:30	Simbaclaws	can I just take your dotfile?
2016-03-04 21:51:45	Airblader	Simbaclaws: If you take my i3blocks config, you also need a bunch of scripts. 
2016-03-04 21:51:54	Airblader	Simbaclaws: Which are of course all in my dotfiles.
2016-03-04 21:52:02	Simbaclaws	in the scripts folder I guess
2016-03-04 21:52:24	Airblader	Simbaclaws: I'm not going to guarantee that they all work on a Linux Mint, though.
2016-03-04 21:52:39	Simbaclaws	would be pretty cool if they did :P
2016-03-04 21:52:54	Airblader	Simbaclaws: They also rely on some other dependencies
2016-03-04 21:53:12	Simbaclaws	oh goody, time to install more stuff
2016-03-04 21:53:16	Airblader	Simbaclaws: I mean I imagine at some point you want the bar to be custmized for your own needs anyway
2016-03-04 21:53:29	Airblader	Simbaclaws: Just take it as a start and modify it
2016-03-04 21:53:51	Simbaclaws	I will try your dotfiles first because I love the appearance of it
2016-03-04 21:54:19	Simbaclaws	I see I need pavucontrol
2016-03-04 21:54:30	Simbaclaws	got it already
2016-03-04 21:54:32	Simbaclaws	nvm
2016-03-04 21:54:37	Airblader	My dotfiles do have a setup.sh, but I don't recommend you run it. It's really focused in a Manjaro / Arch system.
2016-03-04 21:55:03	Simbaclaws	yeah I'm just gonna take over the scripts and the i3block part of your dot files

2016-03-04 21:55:38	jpleau	wait, the gaps branch
2016-03-04 21:55:46	Airblader	jpleau: No, ignore the gaps branch
2016-03-04 21:56:01	Airblader	jpleau: The only difference is allowing the JSON attributes that i3-gaps adds to i3
2016-03-04 21:56:37	jpleau	It's been a while since vivien said he'd work on a way to add custom JSON attrs, he's been busy with other stuff most likely
2016-03-04 21:56:46	Airblader	jpleau: Vivien wanted to add a generic mechanism that would allow for custom JSON keys which would render my fork unnecessary, but he hasn't yet implemented it.
2016-03-04 21:56:58	jpleau	yawr.

2016-03-04 21:59:01	hylke	someone took it
2016-03-04 21:59:54	Airblader	jpleau: Don't worry. I rarely use more than 3–4 windows on a workspace.
2016-03-04 22:00:09	Airblader	jpleau: I tend to put things on separate workspaces instead as well.

2016-03-04 22:01:51	jpleau	Airblader: my issue is that I have "Myopia" (? not sure if thats how you say that in english), and I can't stand glasses or contact lenses. I have to have bigger fonts on terminals.. tiling them makes it not convenient
2016-03-04 22:02:11	jpleau	Getting a 3rd and 4th monitor would solve my issue haha
2016-03-04 22:02:40	armin	jpleau: are you using ctrl-+ / ctrl-- a lot?
2016-03-04 22:02:50	armin	jpleau: to increase/decrease font sizes?
2016-03-04 22:02:54	jpleau	no
2016-03-04 22:03:00	armin	hm.
2016-03-04 22:03:03	armin	you should do that.
2016-03-04 22:03:21	hylke	Airblader, I am simbaclaws. I've just copied over the i3blocks config and scripts into my home dir but some symbols seem to not display correctly is this due to my font?
2016-03-04 22:03:39	Airblader	hylke: You need to install Font Awesome
2016-03-04 22:03:51	jpleau	armin: If I decrease it I won't see from where I sit, that's not better :P
2016-03-04 22:03:55	armin	jpleau: i use that in combination with urxvt

2016-03-04 22:05:46	armin	jpleau: i use that feature 24/7 and i literally can just write code now what ever substance i'm on, because i can just ctrl-+ if i don't see it.
2016-03-04 22:06:14	hylke	I downloaded it from the official website and it gave me a archive with a fonts folder a less folder a css folder and a scss folder, do I just install the fonts inside the fonts folder and setup my i3 with it?
2016-03-04 22:06:22	armin	jpleau: you really want that feature in your terminal workflow if you have bad eyes.
2016-03-04 22:07:00	armin	jpleau: (or abuse strange substances)
2016-03-04 22:07:02	jpleau	armin: mind sharing your script? The one i have doesn't seem to work

2016-03-04 22:20:50	armin	hah
2016-03-04 22:20:51	armin	see
2016-03-04 22:20:56	Airblader	armin: git@github.com:thestinger/termite.git
2016-03-04 22:21:00	armin	i wanted a terminal emulator that does NOT suck.
2016-03-04 22:21:06	Airblader	armin: urxvt sucks, too.
2016-03-04 22:21:09	armin	that is just installable anyẃhere.
2016-03-04 22:21:25	Airblader	armin: I can install my patched termite anywhere, too
2016-03-04 22:21:35	armin	Airblader: yeah it does but i really take 99% out of the pain with my scripts.
2016-03-04 22:21:56	Airblader	armin: Yeah? Do your scripts fix urxvt's horribly broken font rendering? I don't think so :P
2016-03-04 22:21:58	armin	Airblader: then post your f=)$(ing git remote! :)
2016-03-04 22:22:17	armin	Airblader: oh no.
2016-03-04 22:22:22	armin	Airblader: i use pixel fonts.
2016-03-04 22:22:24	Airblader	armin: I don't have a fork of termite. I just have a custom PKGBUILD that applies patches.
2016-03-04 22:22:26	armin	Airblader: a LOT.
2016-03-04 22:22:41	armin	Airblader: i disagree with all that font rendering crap.
2016-03-04 22:23:02	Airblader	armin: urxvt's font rendering *is* broken. Look at the source code.
2016-03-04 22:23:03	armin	Airblader: doesn't work anyway so why bother.
2016-03-04 22:23:13	armin	Airblader: it is.
2016-03-04 22:23:17	Airblader	armin: It just doesn't affect everyone. :)
2016-03-04 22:23:21	armin	Airblader: the source is a horror.
2016-03-04 22:23:23	Airblader	But it affected me.
2016-03-04 22:23:30	armin	sure it did.
2016-03-04 22:23:40	Airblader	Also, the font zooming script for urxvt also resizes the terminal if it's floating
2016-03-04 22:23:40	armin	the code is a fucking nightmare.
2016-03-04 22:23:58	Airblader	In termite, font zooming does exactly that: zoom the font. Nothing else.
2016-03-04 22:24:21	Airblader	And it does so wonderfully
2016-03-04 22:24:41	armin	i adore and behold the infinite strength of the holy grail of eternal war of you for resisting the strength of looking at the source code of urxvt.
2016-03-04 22:24:43	Airblader	I only apply a patch to make font zooming available via Ctrl+ +/- in all modes.
2016-03-04 22:25:04	jpleau	Airblader: does termite allow to configure linespacing and letterspaceing?
2016-03-04 22:25:22	armin	there must be an incredible strong dark force when reading that sourcecode somewhere, did you also recognize that?
2016-03-04 22:25:24	jpleau	I'd have to patch vte myself if I wanted to try it =/
2016-03-04 22:26:01	Airblader	jpleau: termite uses pango for font rendering
2016-03-04 22:26:33	jpleau	ok
2016-03-04 22:26:37	armin	Airblader: mind posting a few copy/paste'able links for drugged lazy nerds like we are?
2016-03-04 22:27:15	Airblader	armin: Links to what?
2016-03-04 22:27:26	armin	Airblader: to termite
2016-03-04 22:27:37	Airblader	armin: I pasted a link earlier lol
2016-03-04 22:27:41	armin	oh
2016-03-04 22:27:48	armin	lol
2016-03-04 22:27:50	Airblader	armin: https://github.com/thestinger/termite
2016-03-04 22:27:50		[ http://is.gd/TgCvCB ]
2016-03-04 22:27:54	austrinus	Airblader: how difficult do you think it would be to implement the config.d stuff?
2016-03-04 22:27:56	armin	weeeelll
2016-03-04 22:28:05	armin	the infinite depths of my terminal emulators ;)
2016-03-04 22:28:17	Airblader	armin: This is my custom PKGBUILD https://github.com/Airblader/pkgbuilds/tree/master/termite
2016-03-04 22:28:17		[ http://is.gd/PWES4E ]
2016-03-04 22:28:43	Airblader	austrinus: That depends on how comfortable you are with C
2016-03-04 22:28:48	armin	OH SHIT, the archers are upon us again!
2016-03-04 22:28:56	armin	nooooooooo
2016-03-04 22:28:57	Airblader	armin: Manjaro, but close.
2016-03-04 22:29:00	armin	ah
2016-03-04 22:29:25	armin	bah
2016-03-04 22:29:30	armin	termite requires gtk3?
2016-03-04 22:29:37	armin	how about no?
2016-03-04 22:29:48	jpleau	Airblader: yeah. arch has vte-ng, debian doesn't :( I'll try to patch the vte package myself, I always wanted to try termite but never took the time to setup vte-ng
2016-03-04 22:30:18	Airblader	jpleau: I mean if you're happy with urxvt, there's no pressing need. I was just annoyed by urxvt.
2016-03-04 22:30:37	Airblader	jpleau: termite wasn't like the holy grail either but eventually I liked it a little bit better than urxvt.
2016-03-04 22:30:41	armin	why so?
2016-03-04 22:30:48	armin	what did you miss?
2016-03-04 22:30:58	Airblader	Proper font rendering that actually works.
2016-03-04 22:31:07	Airblader	Zooming that doesn't resize my window.
2016-03-04 22:31:08	jpleau	Airblader: I've been using rxvt for 2 days, because I found gnome-terminal to be a pain to configure
2016-03-04 22:31:17	armin	ah, first world problems. :)
2016-03-04 22:31:17	austrinus	Airblader: i'm just worried about how long it will take to grok the codebase and find the best place to start 
2016-03-04 22:31:20	jpleau	I'm not loyal to any terminal emulator :)
2016-03-04 22:31:37	Airblader	armin: Also, you complain abou GTK3, but happily run Perl scripts in your terminal emulator :P
2016-03-04 22:31:53	armin	Airblader: ohhhhh you KNEW that one hurts bad.
2016-03-04 22:31:57	armin	Airblader: damn you.
2016-03-04 22:32:15	armin	Airblader: :
2016-03-04 22:32:19	armin	Airblader: :'-(
2016-03-04 22:32:27	armin	Airblader: nerds have feelings, too!
2016-03-04 22:32:27	Airblader	austrinus: Well… what is your goal. Do you care to actually implement this for everyone or do you just need it to work for yourself?
2016-03-04 22:32:57	armin	but, really, i ended up with terminus as my daily driver
2016-03-04 22:33:05	armin	and not give a damn about font rendering
2016-03-04 22:33:15	austrinus	i'd prefer to get it working for everybody. For just me, i could just shell script it up or use j4-make-config
2016-03-04 22:33:32	armin	if i'm so drugged that i need to increase the font size i don't care if the edges are red or blue anyways.
2016-03-04 22:33:33	Airblader	austrinus: OK, yeah, that is what I was gonna say.
2016-03-04 22:34:02	Airblader	austrinus: Just check out where the config is currently parsed. It's really local, you don't need to really understand any of the other parts of the codebase.
2016-03-04 22:34:24	Airblader	austrinus: src/config.c is a good place to look into. :)
2016-03-04 22:34:32	austrinus	alright i'll take a look at it, thanks 
2016-03-04 22:35:17	Airblader	austrinus: I already wrote some thoughts down in the issue, I think. But you probably need to think about the exact workings of the feature on what makes sense.
2016-03-04 22:35:40	Airblader	austrinus: Either way be ready for review comments once you submit a PR. I doubt it'll be a quick merge. We'll likely have some discussions.
2016-03-04 22:35:43	armin	Airblader: but really at some point in time i just ended up living with the fact that i need terminus fonts and urxvt in order to survive
2016-03-04 22:36:20	austrinus	Airblader: i figured it would take some doing 
2016-03-04 22:36:47	Airblader	austrinus: Yeah. I mean it's not rocket science, either, but we do want to do this right. :)
2016-03-04 22:36:56	armin	Airblader: http://unix.porn/xtheme.png
2016-03-04 22:37:48	armin	Airblader: i mean it's basically what you do anyways, apply a base-16 based theme? apply a 256-based theme? grayscale? tput setaf 15?
2016-03-04 22:38:53	Airblader	austrinus: Just looked at my comments again. I think you should go for the "minimal solution" there for now.
2016-03-04 22:39:05	Airblader	austrinus: Just get something nice to work so we can talk specifics.
2016-03-04 22:39:24	austrinus	Airblader: alright i'll see what i can do 
2016-03-04 22:39:34	armin	Airblader: you always have to try to let something fit into your everday workflow. the constantly used color "blue" is being abused as a terminal background color to draw text, even in various BSDs.
2016-03-04 22:40:04	armin	Airblader: it's nonsense.
2016-03-04 22:41:00	armin	Airblader: but still you have to deal with it. 
2016-03-04 22:41:15	Airblader	armin: Man, you really are high. I again have no idea why you're saying any of this.
2016-03-04 22:41:26	Airblader	armin: :)
2016-03-04 22:41:34	armin	Airblader: sure, mc has mc -b, and anything forcing you to look at bright blue interfaces should die in hell anyways, but still.
2016-03-04 22:42:19	armin	anyways, if anyone needs scripts or config files i'm here. ;)
2016-03-04 22:42:36	Airblader	armin: But you just reminded me of a termite feature that YOU would probably like (I don't use it)
2016-03-04 22:42:47	armin	Airblader: hmmm
2016-03-04 22:42:52	Airblader	armin: termite can reload its config in-place. So you can update colors without restarting the terminal.
2016-03-04 22:43:02	armin	Airblader: so you don't care that it requires gtk3?
2016-03-04 22:43:12	Airblader	armin: I have GTK3 installed anyway.
2016-03-04 22:43:28	armin	Airblader: that's a terrible thing to install why did you do that?
2016-03-04 22:43:53	Airblader	Because I use applications that use GTK3.
2016-03-04 22:44:07	armin	damn your applications.
2016-03-04 22:44:33	armin	not a good thing.
2016-03-04 22:44:47	Airblader	I also have GTK2

2016-03-04 22:44:50	Airblader	and QT
2016-03-04 22:44:51	armin	think about how lightweight and awesome i3 is
2016-03-04 22:45:01	armin	and you just throw gtk3 in the mix?
2016-03-04 22:45:10	Airblader	i3 isn't any less lightweight because of GTK3
2016-03-04 22:45:19	Airblader	They're… different things.
2016-03-04 22:45:29	armin	that's entirely true.
2016-03-04 22:46:02	armin	i just said i use i3 on a lot of computers without gtk3
2016-03-04 22:46:35	Airblader	There are even people who use i3 as their window manager in KDE
2016-03-04 22:46:37	Airblader	;)
2016-03-04 22:50:40	jpleau	I've been converting myself to Qt apps
2016-03-04 22:51:03	jpleau	I learned a bit of gtk, and a bit of qt, I found qt to be way more fun to work with

2016-03-05 12:45:49	Simbaclaws	http://dpaste.com/3AVF54J I have this script for setting up my volume control in i3bar. I have all the dependencies, amixer, pactl and pacmd. Yet my volume seems to get turned off and on very frequently it's like there is an interval as to turning it on and off
2016-03-05 12:46:11	Simbaclaws	anyone with knowledge of python in here?
2016-03-05 12:53:15		andyrtr has joined #i3
2016-03-05 12:53:18	Simbaclaws	it's almost like toggle_volume() is run in an interval, causing it to toggle on and off frequently
2016-03-05 12:57:06	pllz	Simbaclaws, are you sure that whatever calls the script passes the right arguments and acts properly?
2016-03-05 12:57:19	Simbaclaws	command=[[ -z "${BLOCK_BUTTON}" ]] || ( [[ "${BLOCK_BUTTON}" == "1" ]] && ((/usr/bin/pavucontrol -t 3 || true) && $HOME/scripts/volume_control.py signal) || $HOME/scripts/volume_control.py toggle ); $HOME/scripts/volume_control.py i3blocks
2016-03-05 12:57:25	Simbaclaws	this is what calls the script
2016-03-05 12:57:31	Simbaclaws	I think there might be something wrong in it
2016-03-05 12:58:12	Simbaclaws	maybe this has something to do with the fish shell not knowing what || means?
2016-03-05 12:58:50	Simbaclaws	should I replace them with or and check whether that works?
2016-03-05 13:00:45		koniu has quit (Quit: leaving)
2016-03-05 13:01:01	Simbaclaws	I changed all the || for or and all the && for and but now it doesn't show any volume anymore
2016-03-05 13:01:07	Simbaclaws	I think that broke it

2016-03-05 13:17:02	pllz	it should be executed if BLOCK_BUTTON != 1
2016-03-05 13:18:08	pllz	but i don't know variables and stuff from your script
2016-03-05 13:20:24	pllz	i hate those long lines with nested logic evaluations :)
2016-03-05 13:25:39	Simbaclaws	well BLOCK_BUTTON I think is a variable that turns it into a button, whenever I click on the i3block volume part it toggles it on or off
2016-03-05 13:25:49	Simbaclaws	which does work
2016-03-05 13:26:00		raphyduck has joined #i3
2016-03-05 13:26:01	Simbaclaws	but apparently the interval causes it to do the same each 5 seconds
2016-03-05 13:27:58	Simbaclaws	I can't find $(BLOCK_BUTTON} in the i3blocks config file I think it's configured elsewhere

2016-03-06 13:09:30	Airblader	sECuRE: Alright. It doesn't seem to be causing issues anyway. I guess the tree_split logic bails out somewhere because it detects the unnecessary split.
2016-03-06 13:11:44	@sECuRE	Airblader: well, t/122-split.t failed with the broken merge :)
2016-03-06 13:11:58	qball	thx for another great release!
2016-03-06 13:12:23	Airblader	sECuRE: Oh, hm. I just gave it a quick local test, normal h/v splits seemed to work fine. Oh well, either way, if it's not in the release, it doesn't matter. I just noticed it when updating i3-gaps.
2016-03-06 13:14:17	Airblader	Now if only the AUR would respond, then I could update the AUR packages.

2016-03-06 13:16:20	Airblader	Now that I updated the tag in i3-gaps correctly, I could finally get rid of the gaps branch.
2016-03-06 13:16:34	Simbaclaws	hurray Airblader :D
2016-03-06 13:25:19	Simbaclaws	is it possible to use a svg or png background for dzen2? I don't think I'm able to create transparent popups otherwise right? I've tried searching for a dzen irc channel but I can't find any
2016-03-06 13:27:11	pllz	Simbaclaws, dzen is not maintained anymore since years
2016-03-06 13:28:04	Simbaclaws	pllz then I suppose there is no option for transparency? I'm trying to create a popup in the middle of my screen with buttons to click on using dzen. Do you perhaps know of any other application I use to accomplish the same thing and make the background of it transparent?
2016-03-06 13:28:06	pllz	and it has some never-fixed bugs like wrong alignment
2016-03-06 13:28:21		mfulz has joined #i3
2016-03-06 13:29:54	qball	I should implement it features in rofi or so
2016-03-06 13:29:59	pllz	Simbaclaws, i can't read it in the docs
2016-03-06 13:30:06	Simbaclaws	pllz :(
2016-03-06 13:30:16	Airblader	Well I better get out of the house before the bug reports come rolling in. :)
2016-03-06 13:30:47	Simbaclaws	qball do you think rofi could act as a scriptable language for creating popups and such?
2016-03-06 13:30:49	pllz	Simbaclaws, https://github.com/LemonBoy/bar
2016-03-06 13:30:49		[ http://is.gd/P4GIHt ]
2016-03-06 13:31:02	pllz	Simbaclaws, you can specify an alpha channel with lemonbar
2016-03-06 13:31:22	Simbaclaws	pllz cool, can I also create clickable buttons inside the window?
2016-03-06 13:31:30	pllz	also it is currently maintained
2016-03-06 13:31:43	pllz	yup
2016-03-06 13:31:59	Simbaclaws	thanks so much pllz I'm gonna try and use lemonbar then :D
2016-03-06 13:32:13	Simbaclaws	guess I'll have to update my sh script a bit
2016-03-06 13:32:48	pllz	yep conceptually it's the same, just a bit different formatting codes
2016-03-06 13:32:58	Simbaclaws	cool

2016-03-06 14:15:05	Simbaclaws	ah I see I do have to pipe it to lemonbar, and if it's a script I use -p
2016-03-06 14:15:07	Simbaclaws	ok simple enough

2016-03-06 14:35:59	Simbaclaws	okraits do you know where it is? I can't seem to find it... or at least the github page doesn't really give any examples on how to input data to lemonbar
2016-03-06 14:36:19	Simbaclaws	I know for example I need to set the -B switch for color but I don't know how to input the AARRGGBB color
2016-03-06 14:36:38	Simbaclaws	same as for the -g switch which I need to create a geometry
2016-03-06 14:37:02	Simbaclaws	I'm using variables in my geometry and for example $WIDTHx$HEIGHT would be seen as one variable...

2016-03-06 14:44:16	pllz	Simbaclaws, that man page is all you need to read
2016-03-06 14:45:02	pllz	maybe you are confused between options and formatting?
2016-03-06 14:45:05	Simbaclaws	pllz okay so I tried the following formatting for -B: -B %{B33dddddd} -B #33dddddd -B %{33dddddd}
2016-03-06 14:45:18	Simbaclaws	none of them work :/
2016-03-06 14:45:26	Simbaclaws	I also tried -B 33dddddd
2016-03-06 14:45:50	pllz	like i suspected...
2016-03-06 14:46:13	pllz	Simbaclaws, can you read the formatting section, please?
2016-03-06 14:46:45	Simbaclaws	but that's what I did :(
2016-03-06 14:46:52	Simbaclaws	I tried the formatting options didn't I?
2016-03-06 14:47:15	pllz	is -B listed under formatting?
2016-03-06 14:47:20	Simbaclaws	or would it need to be -B %{B:33dddddd}?
2016-03-06 14:47:25	Simbaclaws	no it is not
2016-03-06 14:47:37	Simbaclaws	but I can't just input the hex rgb either
2016-03-06 14:48:38	pllz	those first three lines...
2016-03-06 14:48:43	michaelrose	Simbaclaws, what shell?
2016-03-06 14:48:51	Simbaclaws	fish shell, does it matter?
2016-03-06 14:48:56	michaelrose	it really does
2016-03-06 14:48:59	Simbaclaws	hmmm
2016-03-06 14:49:03	michaelrose	# is the comment char
2016-03-06 14:49:06	Simbaclaws	because the fish shell sees # as a comment
2016-03-06 14:49:07	Simbaclaws	yeah
2016-03-06 14:49:16	michaelrose	you can just escape it though
2016-03-06 14:49:23	michaelrose	or wrap it in single quotes
2016-03-06 14:49:31	Simbaclaws	I'll try wrapping in single quotes first
2016-03-06 14:49:51	Simbaclaws	ok that seems to work, thanks
2016-03-06 14:49:54	michaelrose	np
2016-03-06 14:49:58	pllz	oh i was focused about formatting
2016-03-06 14:50:06	michaelrose	I got it because I use fish
2016-03-06 14:50:22	michaelrose	noticed the same issue with a different command
2016-03-06 14:50:24	pllz	because in any case that's not the way you specify colors in lemonbar :)
2016-03-06 14:50:28	Simbaclaws	also is it possible to make lemonbar a floating window in i3? because it basically pushes down all my other windows currently, I want it to be a popup
2016-03-06 14:51:26	Simbaclaws	it just acts like another window :/
2016-03-06 14:51:37	Simbaclaws	even specifying width and height and such doesn't work

2016-03-06 14:52:58	pllz	Simbaclaws, what's the command?
2016-03-06 14:53:31	Simbaclaws	currently it's in a script file the command looks like this: echo $text | lemonbar -p -a 3 -B '#33dddddd' -g "$WIDTH"x"$HEIGHT"+$middleX+$middleY
2016-03-06 14:54:02	Simbaclaws	also, text only displays one line of characters while I have set it up with several lines including buttons :/

2016-03-06 14:55:54	Simbaclaws	but the main problem is that i3 sees it as a normal window that has to be put inside the window manager so the geometry doesn't work nor does it float. Should I write an exception in my i3 config for lemonbar?
2016-03-06 14:56:23	pllz	where is the several lines part?
2016-03-06 14:56:33	pllz	afaik it doesn't support multi line

2016-03-06 14:59:56	Simbaclaws	I have no idea what to do :/
2016-03-06 15:00:14	pllz	i think it's always docked

2016-03-06 15:00:20	Simbaclaws	yeah I think so too :?
2016-03-06 15:00:33	Simbaclaws	but perhaps I could change lemobar in i3 to be float somehow?
2016-03-06 15:01:13	pllz	mhhh
2016-03-06 15:01:16	Simbaclaws	why would you be able to specify a dimension and position if it's always docked....
2016-03-06 15:01:30	michaelrose	why would you want it to float?
2016-03-06 15:01:51	Simbaclaws	because I want a popup message on top of my screen asking me if I want to shutdown or not with buttons to scripts for shutdown lockscreen etc...
2016-03-06 15:02:17	Simbaclaws	I want it to pop up when I press my power button

2016-03-06 15:04:35	pllz	actually it seems width is not the width of the bar, but the width of the text field... i.e. text is cut if you choose small width, but bar is always full-width
2016-03-06 15:05:17	Simbaclaws	so in other words lemonbar can't be used to create pop up messages that aren't docked?
2016-03-06 15:05:41	Simbaclaws	I used dzen2 before but this one doesn't support transparency and I'm not sure about buttons
2016-03-06 15:06:06	qball	full screen rofi with a few options?
2016-03-06 15:06:15	Simbaclaws	I mean, my request is understandable right? would be quite strange if I can't accomplish this
2016-03-06 15:06:33	pllz	Simbaclaws, add '-d' option
2016-03-06 15:06:37	Simbaclaws	-d?
2016-03-06 15:06:55	pllz	yep, also if it should do the opposite i think
2016-03-06 15:07:08	Simbaclaws	ok so it forces to not dock instead of dock xD?
2016-03-06 15:07:37	michaelrose	Simbaclaws, I think you should check out rofi
2016-03-06 15:07:45	michaelrose	or dmenu
2016-03-06 15:07:52	michaelrose	you can actually use both to do this
2016-03-06 15:08:06	michaelrose	and unlike lemonbar they are actually designed to do this

2016-03-06 15:08:12	Simbaclaws	hmmm ok
2016-03-06 15:08:25	Simbaclaws	I do have both installed, could you give me any guidelines as on how to set it up?
2016-03-06 15:08:34	Simbaclaws	or should I go to the docs
2016-03-06 15:08:43	michaelrose	sure its pretty simple personally I like rofi
2016-03-06 15:08:56	Simbaclaws	yeah I'm using rofi aswell instead of my dmenu
2016-03-06 15:09:06	michaelrose	much more configurable and you can set it up to be a window in the middle rather than a bar on the bottom/top
2016-03-06 15:09:55	michaelrose	essentially you just pipe stuff to rofi -dmenu -p valueofprompt
2016-03-06 15:10:19	Simbaclaws	things like text and buttons?
2016-03-06 15:10:26	michaelrose	just text
2016-03-06 15:10:34	Simbaclaws	and how would I make buttons then?
2016-03-06 15:10:39	osse	Hmm, now that I've sort of gotten the grasp of an i3 IPC librar, ipc all the things!
2016-03-06 15:10:42	michaelrose	you want something more complicated for that rofi is all about text
2016-03-06 15:10:48	michaelrose	zenity can do what you want
2016-03-06 15:10:54	Simbaclaws	zenity?
2016-03-06 15:11:02	Simbaclaws	ok I'll check it out... Gotta go eat now be right back
2016-03-06 15:11:11	osse	I just wrote a small script that will increment (or set) the leading number of the current workspace name
2016-03-06 15:11:12	michaelrose	its a command line program that pops up menus with buttons and fields and checkboxes and all that fun stuff
2016-03-06 15:11:37	Simbaclaws	ok good, does it have transparency though ^,^? I'm asking a lot aren't I
2016-03-06 15:11:57	michaelrose	that would be a function of your compositor NOT the program popping up
2016-03-06 15:12:17	michaelrose	you would want to tell your compositor, compton, xcompmgr etc to make that window transparent
2016-03-06 15:12:32	michaelrose	or use for_window and transset
2016-03-06 15:12:54	Simbaclaws	I thought maybe there was a switch for telling the compositor to make it transparent...
2016-03-06 15:13:04	Simbaclaws	is lemonbar does
2016-03-06 15:13:07	Simbaclaws	be right back
2016-03-06 15:13:27	michaelrose	its kind of a dumb way to do it because then each and every app has to have a command line switch and settings for transparency
2016-03-06 15:14:12	michaelrose	you can use for_window to run i3 commands or scripts on new windows cased on criteria like window class, title etc, all in the i3 docs
2016-03-06 15:14:21	michaelrose	transset sets a window transparent
2016-03-06 15:14:49	michaelrose	so you can use for_window + transset to set all windows of a given class transparent when they are created

2016-03-06 15:46:23	Simbaclaws	back, so should I do this with rofi or with zenity :/? I'm confused, I think zenity uses gtk to change the appearance of the dialogs if I'm not mistaken so I'd rather have something where I can set the colors of the background myself like rofi
2016-03-06 15:49:34	Simbaclaws	I'm so frustrated xD
2016-03-06 15:51:37	michaelrose	I would just use rofi
2016-03-06 15:51:44	michaelrose	text ftw
2016-03-06 15:51:57	Han	I love rofi
2016-03-06 15:52:02	michaelrose	just pipe the list of options to rofi use it to pick one and operate on that
2016-03-06 15:52:41	Simbaclaws	my problem is that it's kinda hard to make it look like a dialog :/

2016-03-06 15:56:11	Simbaclaws	I know that, but what I'm saying is I want to have a text like "What would you like to do?" and then 3 buttons underneath with lock, reboot, shutdown
2016-03-06 15:56:36	Simbaclaws	and it will also show the dmenu text in there right?

2016-03-06 16:03:11	Simbaclaws	I'm looking at the manpage myself aswell
2016-03-06 16:03:31	Simbaclaws	also I would like to disable the ability to type in anything
2016-03-06 16:03:37	Simbaclaws	so that it actually becomes a dialog
2016-03-06 16:03:47	qball	there is a flag

2016-03-06 16:08:16	michaelrose	to make it enter the current choice as opposed to whatever text is in the field
2016-03-06 16:08:44	Simbaclaws	so when I type it won't remove the entry's I have in there>?
2016-03-06 16:09:19	michaelrose	it really depends on what you have by default in bindings
2016-03-06 16:09:19	Simbaclaws	wait, do I do this with -only-match?

2016-03-06 16:10:43	michaelrose	it really depends on what you have by default you can bind kb-accept-custom which means output whatever you typed in so far

2016-03-06 16:13:00	Simbaclaws	I just want the entry field to not do anything and keep the options I have
2016-03-06 16:13:01	michaelrose	basically what behavior do you want, when you use rofi as your program launcher what do you want to happen when you hit enter?
2016-03-06 16:13:19	Simbaclaws	when I hit enter? the first option in the list...
2016-03-06 16:13:20	Simbaclaws	Lock
2016-03-06 16:13:30	Simbaclaws	and that should execute a script somewhere
2016-03-06 16:13:44	Simbaclaws	echo -e "Lock\nReboot\nShutdown" | rofi -dmenu -width 200 -hide-scrollbar -no-custom -p "Choose one"
2016-03-06 16:13:47	Simbaclaws	that's what I have so far
2016-03-06 16:13:54	michaelrose	ok but when you use it to start firefox and you have typed fi and the first entry is firefox do you want enter to complete it for you?
2016-03-06 16:14:00	michaelrose	or just enter exactly what you type

2016-03-06 16:14:45	Simbaclaws	complete it ofcourse, but I'm not looking for this sort of behaviour for my dialog... I just want the options to stay there regardless of what I type

2016-03-06 16:17:06	Simbaclaws	qball, do you perhaps have any ideas on how I could accomplish what I want?
2016-03-06 16:17:11	michaelrose	you cannot disable the dialog but you can not type in it ;)
2016-03-06 16:17:33	michaelrose	but the easiest way to select is to start typing and have it narrow selection based on what you type
2016-03-06 16:17:52	michaelrose	and have enter accept the currently selected item
2016-03-06 16:18:05	Simbaclaws	I actually want them to only be able to select through arrow keys and enter or through clicking...
2016-03-06 16:18:23	Simbaclaws	which is impossible?
2016-03-06 16:18:31	michaelrose	by default it should be bound to kp-accept-entry, kb-accept-custom means accept whatever I have typed
2016-03-06 16:18:39	michaelrose	why would you bother to use the mouse though?
2016-03-06 16:19:05	Simbaclaws	good point but still I want it :)
2016-03-06 16:19:36	michaelrose	oh well you can double click to select an entry
2016-03-06 16:19:40	Simbaclaws	so kb-accept-custom would mean that whatever I type it would still be the same option highlighted?
2016-03-06 16:19:57	Simbaclaws	I'm confused
2016-03-06 16:20:05	Simbaclaws	you understand what I'm trying to do don't you?
2016-03-06 16:20:38	michaelrose	ok so the three list items are bob jane sam you pipe these to rofi with the prompt "pick a name"
2016-03-06 16:20:53	Simbaclaws	yep, and each should execute some command or script
2016-03-06 16:20:56	Simbaclaws	if that's possible
2016-03-06 16:20:59	michaelrose	you get a list 3 high showing a name on each line

2016-03-06 16:22:32	michaelrose	or typed sa which would have narrowed the options down to only sam and hit enter
2016-03-06 16:22:52		nokogiri has joined #i3
2016-03-06 16:23:21	michaelrose	what was triggered when you hit enter would have been kb-accept-entry
2016-03-06 16:23:22	Simbaclaws	yeah but you realise I'm trying to make it so it doesn't narrow anything down and the three list items are still there regardless of what I type. Plus I need to be able to enter a command or script that gets executed for each list item that I have not sure how that is done
2016-03-06 16:23:38	michaelrose	that is impossible
2016-03-06 16:23:44	Simbaclaws	that's what I thought
2016-03-06 16:24:16	Simbaclaws	the script part is possible though?

2016-03-06 16:24:28	michaelrose	incidentally you may find you want different bindings for running apps vs picking things in scripts and you can pass these bindings to rofi
2016-03-06 16:24:37	michaelrose	or make a wrapper script which is what I did
2016-03-06 16:25:59	Simbaclaws	I don't get it :/ sorry... This just frustrates the hell out of me
2016-03-06 16:27:39	michaelrose	what part doesn't actually work for you?
2016-03-06 16:28:02	michaelrose	I presume you are the only user using this so if you don't want it to narrow just use your arrow keys or mouse to select
2016-03-06 16:28:02	Simbaclaws	the part where I read entry's from stdout so that it executes a script whenever I select a option in the list
2016-03-06 16:28:20	Simbaclaws	yeah that's what I was thinking aswell so I could just ignore it
2016-03-06 16:28:38	Simbaclaws	but my main problem is that I want it to do some sort of action when I click or select one of the items
2016-03-06 16:28:54	michaelrose	echo so basically the pattern I use is set choice (rofi command)
2016-03-06 16:29:02	michaelrose	switch $choice
2016-03-06 16:29:07	michaelrose	case foo
2016-03-06 16:29:10	michaelrose	do this
2016-03-06 16:29:13	michaelrose	base bar
2016-03-06 16:29:14	michaelrose	do that
2016-03-06 16:29:29	Simbaclaws	ok so I should just script a little switch
2016-03-06 16:29:46	Simbaclaws	so does this switch read from stdout?

2016-03-06 16:32:39	michaelrose	you switch on the value of choice or you can switch directly on the output of rofi if you like

2016-03-06 16:39:09	Simbaclaws	would something like that work?
2016-03-06 16:39:30	Simbaclaws	or should I add \n to each line of list?
2016-03-06 16:40:02	michaelrose	switch statement in bash is different than fish
2016-03-06 16:40:12	michaelrose	and bash uses $() for example
2016-03-06 16:40:13	Simbaclaws	I know but I've forced it to use bash in the script
2016-03-06 16:40:21	michaelrose	why is that?
2016-03-06 16:40:23	osse	Simbaclaws: you are just overwriting the list variable
2016-03-06 16:40:34	Simbaclaws	osse I thought that was what was happening
2016-03-06 16:40:39	Simbaclaws	is there something like += or .=?
2016-03-06 16:40:48	michaelrose	in fish or bash?
2016-03-06 16:40:51	Simbaclaws	bash
2016-03-06 16:40:58	Simbaclaws	I want the script to be written in bash entirely
2016-03-06 16:41:00	osse	+=work
2016-03-06 16:41:02	osse	s
2016-03-06 16:41:03	Simbaclaws	ok
2016-03-06 16:41:10	okraits	You should read some bash scripting documentation.
2016-03-06 16:41:13	Simbaclaws	and I guess I should add newlines aswell
2016-03-06 16:41:20	Simbaclaws	probably should xD
2016-03-06 16:41:23	michaelrose	in fish you would just do set foo $foo somethingelse
2016-03-06 16:41:28	osse	use an array
2016-03-06 16:41:38	Simbaclaws	and then a for loop?
2016-03-06 16:41:41	Simbaclaws	inside of the case?
2016-03-06 16:41:47	osse	list=( Lock Reboot Shutdown ); printf '%s\n' "${list[@]}"

2016-03-06 16:45:29	osse	case "$(...)" in 
2016-03-06 16:45:32	osse	I assume
2016-03-06 16:45:57	Simbaclaws	ok I'll try it out
2016-03-06 16:45:58	osse	rofi prints the choice to stdout right
2016-03-06 16:46:03	Simbaclaws	yeah I think so
2016-03-06 16:46:35	Simbaclaws	Run rofi in dmenu mode. This allows for interactive scripts. In dmenu mode, rofi reads from STDIN, and output to STDOUT. A simple example, displaying 3 pre-defined options:
2016-03-06 16:46:45	Simbaclaws	so yeah it probably does
2016-03-06 16:48:15	Simbaclaws	unexpected ( on line 2, which is list=(Lock Reboot Shutdown)
2016-03-06 16:48:23	Simbaclaws	I'll check the bash docs on how to setup arrays

2016-03-06 16:49:18	Simbaclaws	well the file has #!/usr/bin/env bash so it should force it to execute as bash, I'm using sh in fish shell
2016-03-06 16:49:20		enkeyz has joined #i3
2016-03-06 16:49:44	osse	the file has that in it, yep. but that doesn't matter if you execute it the wrong way
2016-03-06 16:49:56	Simbaclaws	then how should I execute it?
2016-03-06 16:50:14	osse	I don't know, because I'm not sure what you're trying
2016-03-06 16:50:21	osse	that's why I am asking how you do it at the moment
2016-03-06 16:50:22		binaryplease has joined #i3
2016-03-06 16:50:31	osse	you should do:  ./script  or /path/to/script
2016-03-06 16:50:34	osse	something like that
2016-03-06 16:50:43	Simbaclaws	yeah I did bash test.sh and it worked
2016-03-06 16:51:00	Simbaclaws	altho my lockscreen script seems to have some trouble I think I have to move some files around
2016-03-06 16:51:02	osse	then you're executing it the wrong way when it doesn't
2016-03-06 16:51:03	Simbaclaws	sec
2016-03-06 16:51:24	Simbaclaws	probably because sh is symlinked to fish
2016-03-06 16:51:30	Simbaclaws	I think...
2016-03-06 16:51:37	osse	and you're invoking sh ?
2016-03-06 16:51:47	Simbaclaws	I was, untill I invoked bash, which worked
2016-03-06 16:51:51		binaryplease has quit (Client Quit)
2016-03-06 16:52:58	osse	Simbaclaws: in both of those cases the #! line doesn't matter
2016-03-06 16:53:09	osse	it only matters when you run the script itself as an executable
2016-03-06 16:53:51	osse	symlinking sh to bash sounds like a neat way of breaking this
2016-03-06 16:53:53	osse	things
2016-03-06 16:54:02	Simbaclaws	I didn't symlink it to bash
2016-03-06 16:54:23	Simbaclaws	I didn't symlink anything I just assumed it was symlinked to the shell that I'm using
2016-03-06 16:55:52	osse	sorry for ruining your dreams :O
2016-03-06 16:56:06	Simbaclaws	no problem, dreams are there to be ruined
2016-03-06 16:56:53	osse	I meant "symlinking sh to fish sounds like a neat way of breaking things"
2016-03-06 16:57:08	Simbaclaws	ok so I got this script somewhere in $home/scripts and it uses some resources in that same folder. Whenever I run the script from within home it doesn't use those resources but it does when I'm inside that folder with cd, any way to fix that issue?
2016-03-06 16:57:13	osse	it probably *is* symlinked to bash. but if bash is invoked as sh it runs in "sh mode"
2016-03-06 16:57:26	Simbaclaws	ah ok
2016-03-06 16:57:46	osse	specify the resources with a fill path
2016-03-06 16:57:48	osse	full path
2016-03-06 16:57:57	Simbaclaws	lol ok, simple enough :)
2016-03-06 16:58:59	Simbaclaws	same issue, it needs to use bash instead of sh xD

2016-03-06 17:32:44	bendem	reqq456, i3-sensible-terminal chooses the terminal, it's just a script
2016-03-06 17:32:50		Airblader has quit (Quit: WeeChat 1.4)
2016-03-06 17:32:51	Simbaclaws	or should I simply install XFCE's power management tools?
2016-03-06 17:33:02	Simbaclaws	because cinnamon's power management doesn't seem to be working
2016-03-06 17:33:06	bendem	you could too, whatever works
2016-03-06 17:33:12	reqq456	then how do i know what terminal i am using?!
2016-03-06 17:33:22	Illusional	reqq456, type xprop
2016-03-06 17:33:26	michaelrose	i3 has nothing to do with shell colors
2016-03-06 17:33:27	Illusional	and click on your terminal
2016-03-06 17:33:30	michaelrose	it literally cannot effect that
2016-03-06 17:33:54	michaelrose	regarding needing admin rights to shutdown your computer read up on sudo
2016-03-06 17:34:43	michaelrose	its possible to configure sudo to run without a password for some or all commands
2016-03-06 17:34:56	Simbaclaws	bendem what do I do with these charge_full charge_now and status files? they have a number in them and status has Full in it
2016-03-06 17:35:32	Simbaclaws	I need to set my laptop to hibernate instead of suspend after a set period of time...
2016-03-06 17:35:34	bendem	Simbaclaws, charge_full contains the maximum charge, charge_current, the current charge, then it's a rule of 3 to get percents
2016-03-06 17:35:57	--	die_hand is now known as miup
2016-03-06 17:35:58	michaelrose	optimally you should only configure it for some commands like shutdown
2016-03-06 17:36:05	bendem	reqq456, for terminal in $TERMINAL x-terminal-emulator urxvt rxvt terminator Eterm aterm xterm gnome-terminal roxterm xfce4-terminal termite lxterminal mate-terminal terminology; do if command -v $terminal > /dev/null 2>&1; then echo $terminal; fi; done
2016-03-06 17:36:10	bendem	that'll tell you
2016-03-06 17:36:20	Simbaclaws	michaelros I already figured it out
2016-03-06 17:36:28		somis has joined #i3
2016-03-06 17:36:39	Simbaclaws	there were some dbus commands I could run to let it shutdown
2016-03-06 17:36:54	michaelrose	thus the annoyance with requiring admin rights to shut down is merely a configuration issue or a distro default issue if you prefer
2016-03-06 17:37:00	michaelrose	rather than a flaw in linux
2016-03-06 17:37:13	Simbaclaws	yup
2016-03-06 17:37:13	michaelrose	why and how would you shut down via dbus?
2016-03-06 17:37:21	Simbaclaws	dbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.login1 /org/freedesktop/login1 "org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.PowerOff" boolean:true
2016-03-06 17:37:29	Simbaclaws	that will shutdown my computer on my system
2016-03-06 17:37:29	Simbaclaws	:P
2016-03-06 17:37:53	michaelrose	that is an abomination
2016-03-06 17:37:57	Simbaclaws	true that
2016-03-06 17:38:36	michaelrose	that is so bad each time you run it your system should randomly delete one of your files to punish you
2016-03-06 17:38:41	Illusional	^^
2016-03-06 17:38:52		Mossepo has quit (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
2016-03-06 17:39:32	bendem	in this case, I'd say working > nicely written
2016-03-06 17:39:46	michaelrose	I would configure sudo
2016-03-06 17:40:01	michaelrose	which requires only minimal effort and works on more than one command
2016-03-06 17:41:33	brainwash	Simbaclaws: but that's via logind, and logind is part of systemd
2016-03-06 17:41:39	pllz	for me systemctl poweroff requires no priviledges
2016-03-06 17:42:16	bendem	systemctl needs systemd
2016-03-06 17:42:20	Simbaclaws	brainwash I was told that this is not the case and that it's explicitly a dbus command without systemd, I don't even have it installed
2016-03-06 17:42:21	bendem	god, why don't people read
2016-03-06 17:42:36	Simbaclaws	and the command works
2016-03-06 17:43:06	michaelrose	bendem, I think he was pointing out that systemd accomplishes shutting down without root privileges not suggesting it as a solution
2016-03-06 17:43:26	bendem	systemd has root privileges
2016-03-06 17:43:36	michaelrose	exactly
2016-03-06 17:43:40	brainwash	ok, but that means that logind is present on your system
2016-03-06 17:43:47	michaelrose	and it exposes some functionality to the user
2016-03-06 17:44:08	brainwash	and logind is part of systemd
2016-03-06 17:44:24	michaelrose	and does it on the users behalf with its elevated privileges
2016-03-06 17:44:25	okraits	bendem: people not reading is the reason also why we are talking about issues which have nothing to do with i3
2016-03-06 17:44:45	pllz	guys i wasn't able to read from all of the lines above if he has systemd or not
2016-03-06 17:45:13	pllz	okraits, that's true
2016-03-06 17:45:25	Simbaclaws	but if I type in systemd in my terminal it doesn't find it, nor does systemctl
2016-03-06 17:45:28	michaelrose	okraits, not having a full de entails doing some stuff manually, its not i3 related but its tangentially related
2016-03-06 17:45:55	brainwash	Simbaclaws: that's why I wonder
2016-03-06 17:46:16	michaelrose	I presume you have a non systemd distro, unless its old that makes it slackware, ubuntu lts, mint, gentoo/funtoo
2016-03-06 17:46:20	Simbaclaws	it's some ubuntu magic I suppose
2016-03-06 17:46:26	brainwash	maybe a standalone logind implementation
2016-03-06 17:46:26	michaelrose	ubuntu lts/mint is likely
2016-03-06 17:46:28	Illusional	michaelrose, mint
2016-03-06 17:46:31	Simbaclaws	I'm using mint actually
2016-03-06 17:46:35	brainwash	ohh
2016-03-06 17:46:42	Simbaclaws	linux mint 17.3
2016-03-06 17:46:53	okraits	michaelrose: then why use i3 and not a DE if i have no clue how to handle things without a DE?
2016-03-06 17:47:10	michaelrose	using i3 might likely prompt someone to learn
2016-03-06 17:47:22	Simbaclaws	which I'm more then willing to :D
2016-03-06 17:47:32	Illusional	Simbaclaws, https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd
2016-03-06 17:47:32		[ http://is.gd/qGuFqg ]
2016-03-06 17:47:33	michaelrose	which is a good thing
2016-03-06 17:47:36	brainwash	okraits: everyone starts as a noob and will learn as time passes
2016-03-06 17:47:41	Illusional	try reading this
2016-03-06 17:48:00	Simbaclaws	I'll put it in my bookmarks and read it later, I still have to fix some things :/
2016-03-06 17:48:05	michaelrose	incidentally if you stick with mint and keep up to date you will probably be using systemd next version
2016-03-06 17:48:30	Simbaclaws	so they are lacking behind on that part aswell huh?
2016-03-06 17:48:30	michaelrose	16.04 lts will use systemd by default, mint 18 will be based on it
2016-03-06 17:48:38	Simbaclaws	ah ok
2016-03-06 17:48:42	Simbaclaws	good to know
2016-03-06 17:48:45	michaelrose	well mint is based on a lts
2016-03-06 17:48:49	Simbaclaws	I have used systemd on other systems before
2016-03-06 17:48:50	okraits	brainwash: yes, by reading
2016-03-06 17:48:56	Illusional	Simbaclaws, tbh if you're interested in learning mint isn't ideal for that
2016-03-06 17:49:02	foolishmonkey	systemd will take over, that's sure :)
2016-03-06 17:49:20	Simbaclaws	Illusional I guess arch is?
2016-03-06 17:49:24		nnscr has joined #i3
2016-03-06 17:49:31	michaelrose	I would debate that you can't learn on ubuntu
2016-03-06 17:49:54	okraits	You can of course learn on ubuntu
2016-03-06 17:50:02	brainwash	foolishmonkey: it already did
2016-03-06 17:50:14	michaelrose	I would actually point out that it might be easier to learn things if your system was actually stable unlike arch
2016-03-06 17:50:15	foolishmonkey	brainwash, there are few distro that still don't use systemd
2016-03-06 17:50:24	foolishmonkey	arch is stable
2016-03-06 17:50:24	Illusional	michaelrose, it's largely the wiki though
2016-03-06 17:50:31	okraits	michaelrose: arch is stable
2016-03-06 17:50:35	michaelrose	you can use the wiki for reference
2016-03-06 17:50:48	foolishmonkey	maybe it wasn't stable, but today it's one of the most stable distro
2016-03-06 17:50:50	Simbaclaws	arch's wiki is awesome though
2016-03-06 17:51:08	michaelrose	tons of info is generally applicable
2016-03-06 17:51:20	brainwash	michaelrose: why wouldn't you be able to?
2016-03-06 17:51:27	okraits	i'm using Arch since over 10 years and it always has been stable
2016-03-06 17:51:40	michaelrose	the point is the wiki is a great thing but in and of itself its not a huge reason to use arch
2016-03-06 17:51:49	foolishmonkey	okraits, even in the past? I heard bad things about arch
2016-03-06 17:52:13	okraits	foolishmonkey: Yes, stable
2016-03-06 17:52:14	foolishmonkey	I used it for 2 years and 0 problems, but people said to me that in the past arc was unstable
2016-03-06 17:52:17	michaelrose	note that being able as an expert to ride out changes != stable
2016-03-06 17:52:18	Simbaclaws	anyone has an idea on how I can setup power management and lock screens when the lid of my laptop closes on i3 without using a application like xfce-power-management?
2016-03-06 17:52:27	Simbaclaws	because I want to run a custom script that handles my lockscreen
2016-03-06 17:52:36	foolishmonkey	michaelrose, I had more problems with ubuntu than with arch
2016-03-06 17:52:56	michaelrose	I use funtoo but don't pretend its the same amount of effort as ubuntu lts
2016-03-06 17:53:10	brainwash	Simbaclaws: you should probably ask in the mint channel
2016-03-06 17:53:31	Simbaclaws	thanks brainwash, I already did and they told me to either download that power management application or ask i3 :/
2016-03-06 17:53:47	Simbaclaws	so I'm kinda being redirected everywhere
2016-03-06 17:53:48	okraits	foolishmonkey: michaelrose about twice a year there's the need for manual intervention when updating, but i wouldn't call that unstable
2016-03-06 17:54:20	michaelrose	you know how much manual intervention of any kind is required for ubuntu twice a year, zero
2016-03-06 17:54:20	brainwash	Simbaclaws: why not use xfce-power-manager?
2016-03-06 17:54:50	Simbaclaws	brainwash, because... I can't choose which lockscreen to use (a script I have) and I can't choose to set it to hibernate.. Only suspend...
2016-03-06 17:55:06	okraits	michaelrose: of course, because it's supposed to be userfriendly
2016-03-06 17:55:12	michaelrose	of all the numerous things that you might want to learn, most of them are easier to learn while not also learning a fiddly distro
2016-03-06 17:55:25	okraits	michaelrose: FACK
2016-03-06 17:55:34	brainwash	Simbaclaws: hibernation is disabled by default in ubuntu, probably in mint too
2016-03-06 17:56:19	Simbaclaws	brainwash, I can make my machine hibernate with a command same dbus thingy... Can I set it up somehow? perhaps as a cronjob or something?
2016-03-06 17:56:32	foolishmonkey	Simbaclaws, if you do "echo mem >/sys/power/state" does it work
2016-03-06 17:56:34	Simbaclaws	or should I keep it on suspend?
2016-03-06 17:56:36	foolishmonkey	as root of course
2016-03-06 17:56:47		notis has joined #i3
2016-03-06 17:56:56	Simbaclaws	eeerm that sounds rather risky, should I really do this?
2016-03-06 17:56:59	brainwash	Simbaclaws: unlock it
2016-03-06 17:57:17	foolishmonkey	Simbaclaws, at worst it fail and you have to reboot
2016-03-06 17:57:24	Simbaclaws	ok
2016-03-06 17:57:26	Simbaclaws	I'll try
2016-03-06 17:57:43	brainwash	Simbaclaws: https://help.ubuntu.com/14.04/ubuntu-help/power-hibernate.html
2016-03-06 17:57:44		[ http://is.gd/p5uxgH ]
2016-03-06 17:57:48	foolishmonkey	I like that spirit
2016-03-06 17:58:03	Simbaclaws	hmm sudo echo mem > /sys/power/state tells me permission denied
2016-03-06 17:58:18	Simbaclaws	ah thanks brainwash!
2016-03-06 17:58:23	Simbaclaws	I think that's what I need
2016-03-06 17:58:36	Simbaclaws	altho I don't know if I should make my laptop hibernate or suspend :/
2016-03-06 17:58:54	brainwash	Simbaclaws: also, https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xfce#Lock_the_screen
2016-03-06 17:58:55		[ http://is.gd/RUCy2V ]
2016-03-06 17:59:05	Simbaclaws	it already suspends after a short period of time but I want it to run the lockscreen script right before that so that when I come back to my laptop it's locked

2016-03-06 18:00:03	foolishmonkey	That's what I do to suspend my laptop when not closing the lid
2016-03-06 18:00:05	brainwash	you can edit xflock4
2016-03-06 18:00:32	Simbaclaws	ok my screen went black for a split second and then it went back to normal
2016-03-06 18:00:47	foolishmonkey	Simbaclaws, with my command?
2016-03-06 18:00:52	Simbaclaws	yeah
2016-03-06 18:01:01	foolishmonkey	ubuntu or mint?
2016-03-06 18:01:04	Simbaclaws	mint
2016-03-06 18:01:18	foolishmonkey	that's why i find more unstable than arch, nothing work correctly :)
2016-03-06 18:02:02	foolishmonkey	they hack, patch and tweak everything
2016-03-06 18:02:05	michaelrose	I realized that I don't really care about lock screen security on my system and replaced my lockscreen keybind with a function that disables everything but a handful of keybinds and makes all windows transparent
2016-03-06 18:02:09	Simbaclaws	brainwash do you perhaps know where this script is located?
2016-03-06 18:02:10	foolishmonkey	they put their filthy hands everywhere
2016-03-06 18:02:36	brainwash	Simbaclaws: /usr/bin/xflock4
2016-03-06 18:02:41	Simbaclaws	ok thanks
2016-03-06 18:02:47	Simbaclaws	I'll check if I can edit it to my likings
2016-03-06 18:02:58	michaelrose	you know what would be neat if i3-lock had key bindings
2016-03-06 18:03:00	brainwash	you should copy it to /usr/local/bin/xflock4
2016-03-06 18:03:13	Simbaclaws	eeeerm... it's empty
2016-03-06 18:03:20	Simbaclaws	doesn't exist
2016-03-06 18:03:26	brainwash	mmh
2016-03-06 18:03:44	Simbaclaws	I probably don't have it installed
2016-03-06 18:04:04	Simbaclaws	I haven't installed xfce4 only the power management tool
2016-03-06 18:04:18	brainwash	in this case xfce4-power-manager will use a hardcoded lock screen list 
2016-03-06 18:05:14	brainwash	yeah, this can be a bit tricky :/
2016-03-06 18:05:35	Simbaclaws	should I just install xfce4 entirely? I don't really want to have a desktop environment if I can avoid it...
2016-03-06 18:05:39	Simbaclaws	extra resources and such
2016-03-06 18:05:46	brainwash	I guess no
2016-03-06 18:05:58	Simbaclaws	ok
2016-03-06 18:06:54	Simbaclaws	any way I can get xflock in there?
2016-03-06 18:07:15	Simbaclaws	or some dependencies for power management tool?
2016-03-06 18:07:20	Simbaclaws	just a few, not the entire DE
2016-03-06 18:07:40	brainwash	xflock4 is packaged in xfce4-session I think
2016-03-06 18:08:07	reqq456	somehow my bindings are not working, i have for example the follwing: 'bindsym Shift+up exec playerctl play-pause' but this isnt working, if i put the command into a terminal it is working what is wrong?
2016-03-06 18:08:14	Simbaclaws	so only xfce4-session
2016-03-06 18:09:01	Simbaclaws	installing xfce4-session
2016-03-06 18:09:02	brainwash	you will have to try it.
2016-03-06 18:09:28	brainwash	I cannot say if it will work fine in the end.
2016-03-06 18:10:11	Simbaclaws	yeah xflock4 is there now :)
2016-03-06 18:10:21	Simbaclaws	so I can change it to use my lockscreen yes?
2016-03-06 18:10:30	brainwash	try it
2016-03-06 18:10:57	brainwash	I assume that xfce4-power-manager will use xflock4 if present.
2016-03-06 18:11:06	Simbaclaws	good...
2016-03-06 18:11:20	brainwash	and xflock4 is just a simple shell script
2016-03-06 18:11:29	michaelrose	if you bind it to bash -c 'playerctl play-pause' does it work
2016-03-06 18:11:35	Simbaclaws	yeah I can put it on pastebin and show you
2016-03-06 18:12:01	brainwash	you can run xflock4 and test if it works after tweaking it
2016-03-06 18:12:24	Simbaclaws	http://pastebin.com/Tu8ePfPW
2016-03-06 18:12:41	Simbaclaws	that's the current script I suppose I just have to add my command to the for loops?
2016-03-06 18:13:04	brainwash	yeah
2016-03-06 18:14:31	Simbaclaws	awwwww yeah it works :D
2016-03-06 18:14:42	Illusional	\o/
2016-03-06 18:16:37	Simbaclaws	now I gotta go smoke and wait for my system to sleep to test if it does my lock screen aswell
2016-03-06 18:16:45	Simbaclaws	15 minutes
2016-03-06 18:17:01	brainwash	cool :)
2016-03-06 18:17:21	Simbaclaws	also I want to add a Logout option to my rofi dialog that I've created for shutdown
2016-03-06 18:17:32	Simbaclaws	I've checked how i3 does it and it asks nagbar to exit it
2016-03-06 18:17:39	Simbaclaws	not sure what nagbar does to logout :/
2016-03-06 18:17:42	Simbaclaws	I need that command
2016-03-06 18:18:44	Simbaclaws	then after that all I have to do is create another shut down icon in my navbar with i3blocks to have it open up the same dialog :D
2016-03-06 18:18:50	Simbaclaws	and then I think I'm finished messing around
2016-03-06 18:19:33	Simbaclaws	I'll probably find something else after that to change or add

2016-03-06 18:20:11	Simbaclaws	ok cool that's it :)
2016-03-06 18:20:18	Simbaclaws	pretty simple
2016-03-06 18:20:30	michaelrose	most of the time you actually don't want to log out
2016-03-06 18:21:44	Simbaclaws	why not xD?
2016-03-06 18:21:51	Simbaclaws	what if I want to switch to cinnamon for a sec

2016-03-06 18:23:04	michaelrose	reloading/restarting i3 is more useful for changing your i3 config

2016-03-06 18:24:27	Somelauw	What are the advantages of rofi over dmenu?
2016-03-06 18:24:56	Simbaclaws	it's prettier, that's one thing I don't know about the others, also it seems a little bit faster from my perspective
2016-03-06 18:24:59	michaelrose	more configurable looks nicer, configuring the font is not mentally damaged, has history
2016-03-06 18:25:03	michaelrose	built in window switcher
2016-03-06 18:25:24	michaelrose	way more keybindings including a binding to launch the given command in your terminal
2016-03-06 18:25:37	Simbaclaws	I had a small delay with i3-dmenu-desktop and with rofi that seems to be gone now
2016-03-06 18:26:39	Somelauw	reqq456: nm-applet works for me by only putting exec nm-applet in my .i3 config

2016-03-06 18:30:43	michaelrose	Somelauw, are you piping stuff like i3-dmenu-desktop to it or just by default
2016-03-06 18:31:49	michaelrose	personally I prefer to have rofi in run mode to have kb-accept-custom be bound to return and kb-accept-entry be bound to <C-j>
2016-03-06 18:32:23	michaelrose	so by default I just type the command I want to run and hit enter and complete a prior command with c-j
2016-03-06 18:33:03	michaelrose	what would be really neat would to have fish completion in rofi
2016-03-06 18:34:07	Somelauw	Simbaclaws: maybe you can use something like gksudo or another gui wrapper for sudo

2016-03-06 18:38:25	Bubo	is there a changelog for i3-gaps-next ?

2016-03-06 18:46:50	hilbert94	Somelauw: I tried the following, but it does not work: #bindsym $mod+r mode "resize"
2016-03-06 18:47:09	michaelrose	ok set it up to use fish history with rofi, not as nice as having real fish completion but I can do rfi history lilyterm to select from all shell history that includes lilyterm
2016-03-06 18:47:21	hilbert94	Sorry, this is was the line I commented out. Here is the new one:
2016-03-06 18:47:33	hilbert94	bindsym $mod+r exec "/usr/bin/xdotool key Next"
2016-03-06 18:47:38	hilbert94	But it does not work.
2016-03-06 18:48:11	michaelrose	first does xdotool key Next work for you
2016-03-06 18:48:21	hilbert94	What is the best way do test this? I tried to execute "xdotool key Next" in a terminal, but just get ^[[6~
2016-03-06 18:48:42	michaelrose	its not a character that would normally print
2016-03-06 18:48:51	hilbert94	With "Prior" I get ^[[5~ instead.
2016-03-06 18:49:59	michaelrose	oh btw I think you might need to have xdotool execute on key up
2016-03-06 18:50:11	brainwash	try xdotool click 4
2016-03-06 18:50:18	Somelauw	michaelrose: completely by default, I run it as 'rofi -show run'. dmenu-run puts 'man' on top, with rofi, 'man' is on the ninth spot.
2016-03-06 18:50:19	brainwash	and xdotool click 5
2016-03-06 18:50:33	michaelrose	that really isn't quite the same
2016-03-06 18:50:39	foolishmonkey	what does xdotool?
2016-03-06 18:50:43	michaelrose	that would be clicking the scroll wheel
2016-03-06 18:50:54	michaelrose	xdotool is the x automation tool
2016-03-06 18:50:55	Somelauw	I have been too lazy to configure it with some nice looking colors.
2016-03-06 18:51:02	michaelrose	it does a variety of things
2016-03-06 18:51:06		basepusher has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2016-03-06 18:51:10	foolishmonkey	x automation tool >> what does it mean?
2016-03-06 18:51:28	michaelrose	it can programically click buttons, move windows around close them, resize them etc
2016-03-06 18:51:40	foolishmonkey	i t can simulate human inputs?
2016-03-06 18:51:42	Somelauw	Does rofi have configurable keybindings, I would want to configure my own commands to jump through the list quickly.
2016-03-06 18:51:46	michaelrose	get the id of the currently active window is super useful function
2016-03-06 18:51:48		strcat1 has joined #i3
2016-03-06 18:51:48	Somelauw	Maybe I should write my own rofi
2016-03-06 18:51:53	michaelrose	Somelauw, it does
2016-03-06 18:52:38	michaelrose	xdotool with keybindings is a pain in the neck
2016-03-06 18:52:55	michaelrose	because it doesn't work while the key is grabbed so stuff has to execute when the key is released
2016-03-06 18:53:08	hilbert94	michaelrose: Do you want to say that there might not be an easy solution for this question using xdotool?
2016-03-06 18:53:20	brainwash	you can pass --clearmodifiers 
2016-03-06 18:53:25	Somelauw	hilbert94: there is a # before it. Other than that it's a default keybinding so it should work. Not sure what that has to do with scrolling.
2016-03-06 18:53:35	Somelauw	sorry, I'm slow with reading, so I respond when I see text
2016-03-06 18:53:41	michaelrose	in theory it should be xdotool --release key command
2016-03-06 18:54:04	michaelrose	basically you SHOULD just need to put --release after bindsym or bindcode
2016-03-06 18:54:45	hilbert94	I used $mod+r just to be sure that this part of the command works. Actually I want to abuse the Volume Lower/Rise keys, but I was not sure if they are correctly detected by i3. So I commented out the $mod+r and redefined it.
2016-03-06 18:54:59		strcat has quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
2016-03-06 18:55:03	Somelauw	hilbert94: key Next is probably pagedown, you want something like: xdotool click 4/5
2016-03-06 18:55:29	brainwash	that's what I said
2016-03-06 18:55:41	michaelrose	example bindsym --release z exec "bash -c 'xdootol key r'" should work
2016-03-06 18:55:47	michaelrose	I have never got this to work ever
2016-03-06 18:56:19	Somelauw	x automation tool means it doesn't work with wayland probably, but other than that in any i3 / gnome / kde / xfce desktop environment on any application
2016-03-06 18:56:28	michaelrose	however you CAN use xmodmap or xkb to change keys around
2016-03-06 18:56:40	michaelrose	xdotool will not work in wayland but neither does i3
2016-03-06 18:56:51	brainwash	xwayland?
2016-03-06 18:57:01	michaelrose	its not so much as it doesn't work as in wayland currently provides no way to ever create such a tool
2016-03-06 18:57:21	michaelrose	nor can anyone create a keybinding daemon, nor can someone even create a screencast or screenshot tool
2016-03-06 18:57:31	michaelrose	wayland segregates applications from another
2016-03-06 18:57:39	michaelrose	you also can't have a wm
2016-03-06 18:58:11	michaelrose	instead you have a compositor which is the only application that is allowed to have any of these privileges
2016-03-06 18:58:37	hilbert94	michaelrose: What is this example supposed to do? Make the key "z" act like "r"?
2016-03-06 18:58:43	michaelrose	in theory someone could create a standard methodology to delegate such responsability
2016-03-06 18:59:03	Somelauw	in that case I might have to skip on wayland if it becomes mainstream
2016-03-06 18:59:12	michaelrose	it would cause xdotool to emit a r whenever you press the other key which I can't type until I restart i3 lol
2016-03-06 18:59:27	brainwash	gnome/kde will offer a solution for this
2016-03-06 18:59:39	Somelauw	well, i3 can be implemented as compositor
2016-03-06 19:00:11	Somelauw	but making a single application do everything breaks unix philosofy
2016-03-06 19:00:32	hilbert94	For me apparently nothing happened when I pressed z.
2016-03-06 19:00:54	foolishmonkey	Somelauw, no we call that ip
2016-03-06 19:01:22	Somelauw	gnome is mad, they implement their own input method and default to using that instead of the input method globally configured
2016-03-06 19:01:28	brainwash	but GNU/Linux is not unix, or?
2016-03-06 19:01:34	hilbert94	Btw: Is the "bash -c" essential in this example? Could not one call xdotool directly?
2016-03-06 19:02:03	michaelrose	me too that SHOULD work
2016-03-06 19:03:03	Somelauw	foolishmonkey: ip?
2016-03-06 19:03:13	foolishmonkey	Somelauw, the program ip
2016-03-06 19:03:20	foolishmonkey	it does everything which is network related
2016-03-06 19:03:32	foolishmonkey	in few years it will be a firewall and a ssh server too
2016-03-06 19:04:06	hilbert94	My problem does not seem to have an easy solution. I fear that I will give up here. I try to be only a user.
2016-03-06 19:04:21	michaelrose	its good generally because exec foo has none of the useful features of your shell
2016-03-06 19:04:26	Somelauw	well, okay, there are many examples of such programs
2016-03-06 19:04:31		castlelore has quit (Quit: WeeChat 1.4)
2016-03-06 19:04:44	michaelrose	no env variables no shell functions aliases what have you
2016-03-06 19:04:59	hilbert94	Do you need them for xdotool?
2016-03-06 19:05:16	Somelauw	hilbert94: I lost track of you're problem. What are you currently trying and what does it do?
2016-03-06 19:05:31	Somelauw	your*
2016-03-06 19:05:39	michaelrose	brainwash, gnome kde are used to making all their own stuff and don't care if you can run a separate program to say take a screenshot
2016-03-06 19:06:09	michaelrose	someone is making an i3 compatible compositor for wayland called sway
2016-03-06 19:06:09	hilbert94	Somelauw: I want my Lower/Raise Volume keys act as PageUp/PageDown when combined with $mod.
2016-03-06 19:06:28	Somelauw	okay, and what does your command look like?
2016-03-06 19:07:05	michaelrose	I like having an audio mode and using hjkl change tracks and adjust volume
2016-03-06 19:07:09	hilbert94	I tried this, but it does not work: bindsym $mod+XF86AudioRaiseVolume exec "/usr/bin/xdotool key Next"
2016-03-06 19:07:11	michaelrose	space play/pause
2016-03-06 19:07:35	michaelrose	n move all running streams between outputs and make the next output the default
2016-03-06 19:08:53	Somelauw	hilbert94: does /usr/bin/xdotool key Next work when typed in a terminal?
2016-03-06 19:09:06	hilbert94	No.
2016-03-06 19:09:15	hilbert94	We discussed this above.
2016-03-06 19:09:29	Somelauw	I don't know if volume buttons can be combined with modifier keys
2016-03-06 19:10:11	michaelrose	btw shouldn't need to use entire path to xdotool supposing /usr/bin is in your path
2016-03-06 19:10:32	hilbert94	For this reason I tried to abuse $mod+r for this first (commented out the resize command first). But it does not work neither.
2016-03-06 19:10:46	michaelrose	don't know about you but the multimedia keys are not very conveiniently located for that purpose for me
2016-03-06 19:11:19	michaelrose	there is a program called xcape which allows you to make a key do something different when pressed alone vs with a modifier
2016-03-06 19:11:20	Somelauw	for me, volume requires pressing fn, so I would really be surprised if that worked here
2016-03-06 19:11:38	hilbert94	I have a wheel on my keyboard that is very conveniently located. It acts as volume modifier. It would be great to use it as a scroll wheel like the one on a mouse.
2016-03-06 19:11:38	michaelrose	personally I have left control do page down if pressed by itself
2016-03-06 19:11:43	michaelrose	and left alt do page up
2016-03-06 19:12:32	hilbert94	michaelrose: How did you realize these keybindings?
2016-03-06 19:13:00	michaelrose		/opt/bin/xcape -t 250 -e 'Alt_L=Page_Up'
2016-03-06 19:13:00	michaelrose		/opt/bin/xcape -t 250 -e 'Control_L=Page_Down
2016-03-06 19:13:14	michaelrose	xcape has few requirements and compiles easily

2016-03-06 19:13:22	Somelauw	hmm, I might want to use xcape for an easier to reach escape button
2016-03-06 19:13:39	michaelrose	personally caps lock is great for that
2016-03-06 19:13:49	hilbert94	michaelrose: Do you think xcape works with multimedia keys?
2016-03-06 19:14:00	michaelrose	no its only good for modifier keys
2016-03-06 19:14:15	michaelrose	they have one function when pressed with another key and one alone
2016-03-06 19:14:21	michaelrose	multimedia keys are always used alone
2016-03-06 19:14:43	Somelauw	well, caps lock isn't a modifier
2016-03-06 19:14:59	michaelrose	Yes thats why you rebind it

2016-03-06 19:15:13	michaelrose	sorry perhaps that was hard to understand
2016-03-06 19:15:22	michaelrose	I'm not using xcape with Caps
2016-03-06 19:15:25	michaelrose	just xmodmap
2016-03-06 19:16:05	michaelrose	although some people use xcape to make caps serve as both control and escape
2016-03-06 19:16:21	Somelauw	so xmodmap in .Xsession I guess?
2016-03-06 19:16:29	Simbaclaws	hmm seems like my laptop still doesn't suspend when I leave it on... I've tested it and I've used xfce power management on 15 minutes after half an hour it's still on the regular desktop :/
2016-03-06 19:16:39	michaelrose	this however implies a small delay for escape
2016-03-06 19:16:47	michaelrose	I prefer to keep control where it is
2016-03-06 19:16:53	michaelrose	and just bind caps to escape
2016-03-06 19:16:55	foolishmonkey	Simbaclaws, if you close it, does it suspend?
2016-03-06 19:17:08	Simbaclaws	close the lid? I've set it to go to the lock screen
2016-03-06 19:17:11	michaelrose	read the man for xmodmap
2016-03-06 19:17:11	Simbaclaws	that works
2016-03-06 19:17:26	foolishmonkey	you should suspend your laptop when closing the lid
2016-03-06 19:17:28	Somelauw	maybe I can make the super key when pressed on itself open dmenu or rofi
2016-03-06 19:17:32	Simbaclaws	hmm ok

2016-03-06 19:17:45	Simbaclaws	dunno if that is possible because I couldn't change it for some reason, lemme check again
2016-03-06 19:18:01	Somelauw	or I can use one of my modifiers as tmux escape sequence
2016-03-06 19:18:12	michaelrose	anyway take care all
2016-03-06 19:18:13	Somelauw	too much potential for abuse here
2016-03-06 19:18:43	Simbaclaws	hmm odd, it told me it wasn't running when I opened it up. Let me see if whenever I close it it will stop running
2016-03-06 19:19:45	hilbert94	Thank you all for your help. I am off.

2016-03-06 19:22:24	foolishmonkey	Simbaclaws, isn't there leds?
2016-03-06 19:22:37	foolishmonkey	try to run a program and see if the program did things
2016-03-06 19:22:42	Somelauw	Simbaclaws: if you awake from suspend there is a full screen visible forme
2016-03-06 19:22:44	Simbaclaws	yeah but those are for wifi and bluetooth and yes it does work I've tried peeking under it
2016-03-06 19:22:51	Somelauw	and it loses wireless connexxion
2016-03-06 19:23:18	Simbaclaws	I saw it working
2016-03-06 19:23:34	Simbaclaws	but I guess I'll have to start xfce4-power-manager with i3 when my computer boots
2016-03-06 19:23:52	Simbaclaws	I'm gonna do the "away" test again... not do anything for 15 minutes and see if it suspends like it should
2016-03-06 19:24:08	Somelauw	bah, rofi has run-exact and run in terminal but not run-exact match in terminal

2016-03-06 19:31:28	Somelauw	if you can add scripts to rofi, I would except there is also a better way to implement a shutdown/sleep/hibernate script
2016-03-06 19:32:27	Somelauw	something better than using your own switch like this http://pastebin.com/JpqYv9B6

2016-03-06 19:54:28	Simbaclaws	not a question about i3 but: does anyone know of a linux app that displays all characters in a font so you can search for them and copy them? I'm looking for a shutdown icon in a font I'm using
2016-03-06 19:55:28	foolishmonkey	all characters?
2016-03-06 19:55:38	foolishmonkey	they're a legion
2016-03-06 19:55:38	Simbaclaws	well I guess yeah...
2016-03-06 19:55:49	Simbaclaws	well preferably icons
2016-03-06 19:56:38	Simbaclaws	I just need a app that opens up a font and let's me search through it's characters and also gives me the right character so I can simply copy and paste it
2016-03-06 19:57:33	brainwash	gnome-characters
2016-03-06 19:57:52	Simbaclaws	thanks
2016-03-06 19:58:29	brainwash	or maybe it's still named gucharmap
2016-03-06 19:58:55	Simbaclaws	there is one called font-manager, not sure if that's it...
2016-03-06 19:59:42	brainwash	"font management application for the GNOME desktop"
2016-03-06 19:59:50	brainwash	could be it

2016-03-06 20:00:51	Simbaclaws	I don't think that's it, looking at the screenshots it seems like a program that only "manages" fonts you currently have
2016-03-06 20:01:10	Simbaclaws	ah lol I have gucharmap already installed, didn't even know that
2016-03-06 20:01:18	stryakr	when setting fonts for i3, it seems like the font sizes are far too large even with small settings.  I have the font line set to "font pango:$font-name $font-size". Is there something I could be doing differently to fix this?

2016-03-06 20:06:41	foolishmonkey	stryakr, what is the size of the screen? what is your resolution? do the math
2016-03-06 20:06:49	Simbaclaws	found it! :D
2016-03-06 20:06:58	stryakr	foolishmonkey: got it
2016-03-06 20:07:24	Simbaclaws	what does U+F011 mean? is that the code I should put in to get this character?
2016-03-06 20:07:28	Simbaclaws	how do I do that?
2016-03-06 20:07:43	foolishmonkey	Simbaclaws, ?
2016-03-06 20:08:03	Simbaclaws	I found the character in the font that I want to use using gucharmap or whatever it was called
2016-03-06 20:08:10	Simbaclaws	now I don't know how to copy it
2016-03-06 20:08:19	Simbaclaws	oh nevermind I think I got it
2016-03-06 20:08:21	foolishmonkey	Simbaclaws, do you have the unicode?
2016-03-06 20:08:23	Simbaclaws	there is a copy button xD

2016-03-06 21:19:03	sageinventor	is this shutdown block a button?
2016-03-06 21:19:37	Simbaclaws	well it should just be something I can click on but I've seen that you don't need to turn it into a button, like with the [volume] one
2016-03-06 21:19:51	Simbaclaws	when I click on [volume] a sound manager appears
2016-03-06 21:20:14	Simbaclaws	even though that script doesn't link to it
2016-03-06 21:20:28	Simbaclaws	so I'm thinking there is something else I also have to configure but I don't know what
2016-03-06 21:20:46		pez has joined #i3
2016-03-06 21:20:52	sageinventor	so the volume block has a script that finds the current volume level, but it also produces a sound manager? are you sure that isn't in the script?
2016-03-06 21:20:56	sageinventor	that dosn't make sense to me
2016-03-06 21:21:26	Simbaclaws	well yeah it does which is kind of weird... I have no idea how Airblader did it, but these are his dotfiles
2016-03-06 21:22:01	Simbaclaws	I think there is some script I might have copied that I'm missing entirely but I'm not sure :/
2016-03-06 21:22:09	sageinventor	ohhhh gotcha. I think he had a magical command at the begining somewhere?
2016-03-06 21:22:27	Simbaclaws	seperator_block_width?
2016-03-06 21:22:40	Simbaclaws	I don't know what you're talking about :P sorry
2016-03-06 21:22:50	sageinventor	one second, im looking now
2016-03-06 21:23:40	sageinventor	do you know what instance does?
2016-03-06 21:23:57	Simbaclaws	no :S no idea I'm quite new to i3 entirely
2016-03-06 21:24:45	--	[ace]_ is now known as [ace]
2016-03-06 21:24:47	sageinventor	hmm, im stuck as well. ill keep playing though
2016-03-06 21:25:52	Simbaclaws	I think it could be somewhere in the scripts folder... Some script that's causing it to work the way it's intended
2016-03-06 21:26:17	sageinventor	pastebin the script for me too? and the audio one for good measure pls
2016-03-06 21:26:45	Simbaclaws	that's the thing I don't know which script it is, I just copied all his scripts from his scripts folder into my own
2016-03-06 21:27:04	Simbaclaws	I'll pastebin the volume script I wrote that with help from him because it wasn't working as intended for me
2016-03-06 21:27:09	Simbaclaws	since I'm using a different shell
2016-03-06 21:27:54	sageinventor	what shell?
2016-03-06 21:28:04	Simbaclaws	#!/usr/bin/env bash
2016-03-06 21:28:18	sageinventor	oh thats still bash
2016-03-06 21:28:19	Simbaclaws	ups
2016-03-06 21:28:24	Simbaclaws	well that's in the file
2016-03-06 21:28:26	Simbaclaws	I'm using fish
2016-03-06 21:28:35	Simbaclaws	but that ensures it's running in bash when I have it in the command
2016-03-06 21:28:40	Simbaclaws	http://pastebin.com/ptsJh1Ex
2016-03-06 21:29:01	Simbaclaws	but I don't think it has anything to do with my problem though :P
2016-03-06 21:29:04	sageinventor	ahh, see the script has the button stuff in it
2016-03-06 21:29:11	Simbaclaws	ah ok
2016-03-06 21:29:23	sageinventor	so the shutdown script probably needs some button code somewhere
2016-03-06 21:29:32	Simbaclaws	hmmm ok
2016-03-06 21:29:41	sageinventor	its also got another python script that it links too
2016-03-06 21:29:46	sageinventor	so can I see the shutdown script?
2016-03-06 21:30:06	Simbaclaws	yeah sure, it's a script that basically starts rifo as some sort of dialog
2016-03-06 21:30:23	Simbaclaws	it doesn't have ${BLOCK_BUTTON} in it anywhere so that's probably my issue
2016-03-06 21:30:33	Simbaclaws	I have no idea how to script it with block buttons though
2016-03-06 21:31:06	sageinventor	I wonder if you can just make it a button with the option in the regular config
2016-03-06 21:31:15	Simbaclaws	http://pastebin.com/UvM5aALE
2016-03-06 21:31:18	sageinventor	like this: command=echo button=$BLOCK_BUTTON x=$BLOCK_X y=$BLOCK_Y
2016-03-06 21:31:35	Simbaclaws	that is possible I think...
2016-03-06 21:32:06	Simbaclaws	also I'm not quite sure where the block will be put, whether it will be put in front of my [time] or not :/
2016-03-06 21:32:17	Simbaclaws	oh yes it would it's in chronological order
2016-03-06 21:32:19	Simbaclaws	nevermind
2016-03-06 21:33:18	Simbaclaws	ok if I add button=$BLOCK_BUTTON in my [shutdown] it will cause status_command to fail
2016-03-06 21:33:51	sageinventor	right, I got that too
2016-03-06 21:34:06	sageinventor	#BLOCK_BUTTON is an enviroment var, so maybe you have to set it?
2016-03-06 21:34:27	Simbaclaws	would be strange because in the volume.sh it's also being refered to

2016-03-06 21:35:48	sageinventor	this has good stuff on buttons, but Im still confused
2016-03-06 21:36:02	Simbaclaws	hmm I'll take a look
2016-03-06 21:45:48	Simbaclaws	I think it has something to do with seperator_block_width
2016-03-06 21:46:20	Simbaclaws	the only one that has it is the first one from the right, I've tried changing it to be my [shutdown] but that causes status_command process to fail
2016-03-06 21:47:02	sageinventor	my issue with the status command fail was trying to set the BLOCKS var
2016-03-06 21:47:16	sageinventor	so parse through your config file and make sure nothing stupid is getting in the way of it launchign
2016-03-06 21:47:29	sageinventor	did it just start when you started making shutdown a button?
2016-03-06 21:47:34	sageinventor	cause that is probably why it broke
2016-03-06 21:48:04	Simbaclaws	did what start?
2016-03-06 21:48:20		somis has quit (Quit: WeeChat 1.4)
2016-03-06 21:48:31	sageinventor	the status_command fail
2016-03-06 21:48:35	Simbaclaws	I didn't get any issues when I used both button and x and y it just worked but didn't display
2016-03-06 21:48:42	sageinventor	oh gotcha. I have no clue then
2016-03-06 21:48:48	Simbaclaws	I didn't get it until I changed the seperator_block_width
2016-03-06 21:49:06	Simbaclaws	I think that is used to seperate the blocks and is causing it to not show my block
2016-03-06 21:49:14	Simbaclaws	but now I need to get it working again...
2016-03-06 21:53:51	Simbaclaws	ok so this is really weird, as soon as I remove seperator_block_width=0 from [time] it starts to fail. then when I put it back it keeps on failing. Only if I copy and paste the entire script back again from the dot file it seems to work as expected again :/
2016-03-06 21:54:10	Simbaclaws	reallllly strange stuff happening here
2016-03-06 21:56:15	Simbaclaws	nevermind I misstyped it every time
2016-03-06 21:56:21	Simbaclaws	didn't change a thing
2016-03-06 22:00:16	Simbaclaws	ok good I got the button to display! :D
2016-03-06 22:00:25	Simbaclaws	now I need to check whether I can make it a button
2016-03-06 22:00:56	osse	I want a small program that just gives me a window I can type in and use what I typed. Something like how i3-input works except it (for example) just prints the result to stdout. Any suggestions?
2016-03-06 22:06:04	Simbaclaws	hmm seems like my button only displays when I echo out text...
2016-03-06 22:11:05	Simbaclaws	ok I got it working to the point where I can see the button and I can click on it, but as soon as I close the program the button dissapears, I think this is because it needs some sort of output
2016-03-06 22:11:13	Simbaclaws	I think I can get it to work
2016-03-06 22:12:08	Simbaclaws	YAY I got it to work! :D

2016-03-07 00:18:04	P-G	I've got a silly question. I have two containers arranged horizontally. IRC on the right, left container has tabs for music player and web browser with web browser on the left. How can I get fom the web browser tab to IRC without displaying my music player while typing in IRC?

2016-03-07 00:18:43	P-G	I've found this "go_to_window" bindsym but I'm not sure that's the right approach.
2016-03-07 00:19:17	P-G	If it is, would I just have one shortcut to assign a window number then another shortcut to jump to that number?
2016-03-07 00:19:19		tasse has joined #i3
2016-03-07 00:23:06	P-G	Or I guess it's better to focus the parent container then focus right?

2016-03-07 11:49:34	trunk_monkey	Hey Guys, I installed i3 on Arch the other day, and when I log in, the mouse spins for about a minute acting like something is loading. I thought it was because I didn't have --no-startup-id on exec compton -b, but adding --no-startup-id to compton caused i3 to load incorecttly and become unresponsive
2016-03-07 11:50:11	trunk_monkey	So I removed --no-startup-id in tty and i3 launched, but still spinning mouse..
2016-03-07 11:51:28	e^1	anyone using i3 on arch, can say how many total packages you guys have ?
2016-03-07 11:51:37	SardemFF7	trunk_monkey: you don’t have any other exec in your config?

2016-03-07 11:53:11	SardemFF7	trunk_monkey: then it’s compton. Try removing the "-b" maybe? (it’s not needed here)
2016-03-07 11:54:03	trunk_monkey	Oh ok, I had screen tearing issues, that seemed to be resolved by adding that
2016-03-07 11:54:40	SardemFF7	by adding "-b" to compton? that’s weird

2016-03-07 11:55:25	trunk_monkey	IDK it seemed like it fixed it, but per the wiki the -b just means background process for session
2016-03-07 11:55:57	trunk_monkey	I could probably remove it entirely and create a systemctl for it
2016-03-07 11:56:05	trunk_monkey	compton that is
2016-03-07 12:00:29	trunk_monkey	That fixed it

2016-03-07 13:05:19	Simbaclaws	what should I use to seperate this output to individual variables? 1;0⏎ the 1 and 0 should be in seperate variables, should I use sed or grep or something?
2016-03-07 13:05:50		ArchNoob has quit (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
2016-03-07 13:06:04	Simbaclaws	it could become any number
2016-03-07 13:06:17	Simbaclaws	so for example 21;3⏎
2016-03-07 13:06:54		irco has joined #i3
2016-03-07 13:10:32	Simbaclaws	I should probably use grep with a regular expression, still not that famillair with it but I'll check the docs

2016-03-07 13:13:57	osse	Simbaclaws: in a shell script you mean?
2016-03-07 13:14:25	Simbaclaws	basically I want to execute grep on /usr/lib/update-notifier/apt-check
2016-03-07 13:14:41	Simbaclaws	so up to the ; character is for the first variable
2016-03-07 13:14:50	Simbaclaws	and up to the ⏎ character for the second variable
2016-03-07 13:14:54	Simbaclaws	and yes in a shell script
2016-03-07 13:15:02	Simbaclaws	not including those chars btw
2016-03-07 13:15:05	osse	does that file only contain one line like that?
2016-03-07 13:15:36	Simbaclaws	yes like I said previously it displays for example: 1;0⏎ for 1 regular upgrade and 0 security upgrades
2016-03-07 13:16:10	osse	Simbaclaws: IFS=\; read reg sec </usr/lib/update-notifier/apt-check
2016-03-07 13:16:25	osse	printf '%s regular upgrades available\n' "$reg"
2016-03-07 13:16:27	osse	etc.
2016-03-07 13:17:04	Simbaclaws	so wait IFS contains 1?
2016-03-07 13:17:25	osse	IFS contains a ; for the duration of that command
2016-03-07 13:17:47	Simbaclaws	isn't there an easier way to do it with grep?
2016-03-07 13:18:12	osse	not that I can think of
2016-03-07 13:18:19	Simbaclaws	like for example: update= /usr/lib/update-notifier/apt-check | grep -o '^[^;]*'
2016-03-07 13:18:23	osse	it's doable with sed. but it won't be "easier" in my opinion
2016-03-07 13:18:27	Simbaclaws	or something along those lines

2016-03-07 13:19:24	osse	if you wish
2016-03-07 13:19:33	osse	but it's longer, and heavier
2016-03-07 13:19:55	Simbaclaws	so what exactly happens when I use the IFS thingy? are they put in seperate variables?
2016-03-07 13:20:36		Morley has quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
2016-03-07 13:20:40	osse	'read' reads a line. it assigns what it reads into variables 
2016-03-07 13:20:45	Simbaclaws	also I think that regular expression I put in doesn't work the way it's intended
2016-03-07 13:20:52	osse	it splits what it reads based on the contents of IFS
2016-03-07 13:21:07	Simbaclaws	ah ok
2016-03-07 13:21:33	Simbaclaws	so \; would seperate it and read both the first and the second number

2016-03-07 13:21:51		Morley has joined #i3
2016-03-07 13:22:00	Simbaclaws	but then what happens to the last character in the line? ⏎
2016-03-07 13:22:10	Simbaclaws	you see the arrow?
2016-03-07 13:22:23	Simbaclaws	or don't you have a iconic font configured?
2016-03-07 13:22:27	osse	i see it
2016-03-07 13:22:31	Simbaclaws	hmm ok
2016-03-07 13:22:37	Simbaclaws	so I would need to filter that out aswell

2016-03-07 13:22:43	osse	it's where read stops reading. it won't be included in the last varaible
2016-03-07 13:22:47	osse	no
2016-03-07 13:22:50	osse	it works just fine
2016-03-07 13:22:51	Simbaclaws	hmm ok
2016-03-07 13:22:52	osse	try it
2016-03-07 13:22:54	Simbaclaws	ok sec
2016-03-07 13:23:59	Simbaclaws	so wait $reg contains the second one and %s contains the first one?
2016-03-07 13:24:07	Simbaclaws	because I need to add them to eachother
2016-03-07 13:24:11	Simbaclaws	and then use that
2016-03-07 13:24:36	osse	now you're imagining things
2016-03-07 13:24:52	Simbaclaws	sorry for being such a noob :/
2016-03-07 13:24:53	osse	'read' is the one reading the file. there is no %s there
2016-03-07 13:25:07	osse	if you're unfamiliar with printf then just ignore it
2016-03-07 13:25:16	Simbaclaws	I am a tiny bit famillair with it
2016-03-07 13:25:18	osse	you can do  sum=$(( reg + sec ))
2016-03-07 13:25:26	Simbaclaws	aaaaah it's stored in reg and sec
2016-03-07 13:25:28	Simbaclaws	duh

2016-03-07 13:33:56	Simbaclaws	osse told me this was the way to do it. I have no idea what I'm doing xD
2016-03-07 13:34:02	Simbaclaws	I'm a little bit of a noob
2016-03-07 13:34:11	binamkayastha	Anyone want to help me with a 3200x1800 problem? xD.  I've tried: xrandr -dpi 192, and xrandr -- -dpi 192, yet programs like firefox and baobab still turn out to be super tiny
2016-03-07 13:34:29	Kelsar	<(command) instead < file
2016-03-07 13:34:35	Kelsar	@Simbaclaws
2016-03-07 13:35:11	Kelsar	or command | read ...
2016-03-07 13:35:17	Simbaclaws	ah ok
2016-03-07 13:35:18	Simbaclaws	thanks
2016-03-07 13:35:23	Simbaclaws	got it
2016-03-07 13:35:28	Simbaclaws	just got to pipe it to read
2016-03-07 13:36:41	Simbaclaws	hmm seems like if I change it to: IFS=\; /usr/lib/update-notifier/apt-check | read reg sec it doesn't display anything
2016-03-07 13:37:04	Simbaclaws	or should I put \; before read?

2016-03-07 13:37:27	Simbaclaws	nope doesn't work either :/
2016-03-07 13:39:10	Kelsar	Simbaclaws: that looks stange, what should you field divider be?
2016-03-07 13:39:38	Simbaclaws	well the output of /usr/lib/update-notifier/apt-check is: 1;0⏎
2016-03-07 13:39:43	Simbaclaws	it could be any number for 1 and 0
2016-03-07 13:39:54	Simbaclaws	and I need to get these 2 values in seperate variables
2016-03-07 13:40:11	Kelsar	so your IFS is ;
2016-03-07 13:40:15	Simbaclaws	yeah
2016-03-07 13:40:36	Kelsar	Simbaclaws: did you expect read to output something?
2016-03-07 13:41:09	Kelsar	ypu should have the values inside your variables
2016-03-07 13:41:11	Simbaclaws	well I expect it to use reg and sec with the values from apt-check
2016-03-07 13:41:27	Simbaclaws	but it doesn't show up...
2016-03-07 13:41:31	Kelsar	ah wait i see your failer
2016-03-07 13:41:40	Simbaclaws	what is it?
2016-03-07 13:42:00	Simbaclaws	is it the icon at the end?
2016-03-07 13:42:07	Kelsar	the way you pipe IFS is only set for apt-check, not read. write it in front of read or do an erxpoert
2016-03-07 13:42:08	Simbaclaws	osse told me it'd filter that with read
2016-03-07 13:42:31	Simbaclaws	aaaah ok
2016-03-07 13:42:35	Simbaclaws	so read | apt-check
2016-03-07 13:42:36	Simbaclaws	like that
2016-03-07 13:42:40	Kelsar	no...
2016-03-07 13:42:43	Simbaclaws	oh...
2016-03-07 13:42:58	Simbaclaws	could you give an example?
2016-03-07 13:42:58	Kelsar	apt-check ... | IFS=\; read fuu
2016-03-07 13:43:05	Simbaclaws	aaaah ok
2016-03-07 13:43:07	Simbaclaws	thanks :D

2016-03-07 13:44:16	Simbaclaws	it's an i3block script

2016-03-07 13:52:59	osse	you said apt-check was a file with those numbers in it! is it a program?
2016-03-07 13:53:10	Simbaclaws	I think it's a program yes, I never said it was a file :P
2016-03-07 13:53:21	Simbaclaws	I said the output was numbers

2016-03-07 13:53:48	Simbaclaws	ah thanks
2016-03-07 13:53:52	Simbaclaws	I'll check if that works
2016-03-07 13:54:32	Kelsar	osse: that still is a pipe

2016-03-07 13:54:46	Simbaclaws	still doesn't seem to work
2016-03-07 13:55:25	osse	Kelsar: kind of. but in this case it works
2016-03-07 13:55:27	Simbaclaws	I think I must be doing something wrong :/
2016-03-07 13:56:12	Simbaclaws	when I do: UPDATES= $(( reg + sec )) UPDATES = 0 or at least it exists, while I do have 1 in it I think
2016-03-07 13:56:20	Simbaclaws	wait let me check if I can echo it before I do the check
2016-03-07 13:56:30	osse	you cannot have spaces around the =
2016-03-07 13:56:38	Simbaclaws	I don't have them
2016-03-07 13:56:41	Kelsar	osse: yes, but not because of the pipe, subshell invocation is the problem, read reads form stdin
2016-03-07 13:56:52	Simbaclaws	it's like this: UPDATES=$(( reg + sec ))
2016-03-07 13:57:07	Kelsar	but i must admit, forgot about this
2016-03-07 13:58:08	osse	Simbaclaws: show the full script as it is now

2016-03-07 13:59:23	Simbaclaws	I've already tried changing reg and sec inside UPDATES with a $
2016-03-07 13:59:28	Kelsar	instead < <() you want <()
2016-03-07 13:59:34	Simbaclaws	hmm ok
2016-03-07 13:59:46	osse	nope
2016-03-07 13:59:54	Simbaclaws	it says syntax error when I do that
2016-03-07 14:00:17	Simbaclaws	oh nvm
2016-03-07 14:00:19	Simbaclaws	it was the space
2016-03-07 14:00:28	Simbaclaws	but still same issue, doesn't display anything
2016-03-07 14:00:35	Simbaclaws	it exits because it thinks UPDATES = 0
2016-03-07 14:00:39		rok has quit (Quit: rok)
2016-03-07 14:00:52	Simbaclaws	probably because reg and sec contain no numerical values of some sort

2016-03-07 14:01:59	Simbaclaws	hmm odd, it seems not to work with either of those
2016-03-07 14:02:19	osse	Simbaclaws: google tells me apt-check uses a : and not a ;
2016-03-07 14:02:24	osse	is that true?
2016-03-07 14:02:28	Simbaclaws	my shell does something different...
2016-03-07 14:02:37	Simbaclaws	1;0⏎
2016-03-07 14:02:42	Simbaclaws	tells me this in the shell
2016-03-07 14:02:53	Simbaclaws	could it be because I'm using fish that it generates a ; instead of a :?
2016-03-07 14:03:07	Simbaclaws	would be strange :/
2016-03-07 14:03:10	osse	nope
2016-03-07 14:03:49	Simbaclaws	this is frustrating xD
2016-03-07 14:03:52	osse	Simbaclaws: instead of  <(/usr/...)  put  <(echo '5;7')  to test. does that work?
2016-03-07 14:04:04	Simbaclaws	ok sec I'll try
2016-03-07 14:04:28	Simbaclaws	yeah that works
2016-03-07 14:04:40	osse	then the problem is that apt-check does not print what you think
2016-03-07 14:04:40	Simbaclaws	I think it's because of the arrow character at the end...

2016-03-07 14:07:43	Simbaclaws	could it be that the newline character messes up?
2016-03-07 14:07:52	Simbaclaws	or is this a stupid assumption
2016-03-07 14:09:22	osse	ugh, hexdump defaults confuse me

2016-03-07 14:10:56	Simbaclaws	yay! it works
2016-03-07 14:10:57	osse	the Enter arrow thingy is probably something fish prints precisely because this command does *not* print a newline at the end
2016-03-07 14:11:14	Simbaclaws	hmm ok
2016-03-07 14:12:00	osse	the problem all along has been that apt-check prints to standard error instead of standard output
2016-03-07 14:12:25	Simbaclaws	what does it mean to print to standard error?
2016-03-07 14:13:08	Simbaclaws	hmmm now to make it more beautiful I should find a security icon and a update icon

2016-03-07 14:13:44	osse	by default all programs can write to two different places. one is meant for regular output, one is meant for errors, logging and diagnostics. Usually you will see both printed to the terminal
2016-03-07 14:14:12	Simbaclaws	ah ok thanks for the explenation osse :)
2016-03-07 14:14:14	Simbaclaws	<3

2016-03-07 14:15:16	Simbaclaws	ah I see, learned something new today :D
2016-03-07 14:15:23	Kelsar	to be exact, it sends Filedescriptor 2 to 1
2016-03-07 14:15:53	Simbaclaws	I'll check what file descriptors are

2016-03-07 14:18:14	Kelsar	Simbaclaws: yes and no, they work everywhere beside lemonbar
2016-03-07 14:19:00	Simbaclaws	I'm not famillair with lemonbar enough to help you out though, I've never used it
2016-03-07 14:19:09	Simbaclaws	is it like a xft font?
2016-03-07 14:19:24	Kelsar	lemonbar is a statusbar
2016-03-07 14:19:37	Simbaclaws	yeah I know that :P

2016-03-07 14:20:32	Kelsar	could be a powerline bindings fail also, i don't know. asked in the powerline google group, no usefull response till today
2016-03-07 14:20:35	Simbaclaws	what if you do bar -f "font family name:size=10"
2016-03-07 14:20:53	Kelsar	no symbols, it uses the font 
2016-03-07 14:21:01	Simbaclaws	so no error messages?
2016-03-07 14:21:10	Kelsar	nope, that would make things easy ;)
2016-03-07 14:21:12	Simbaclaws	are you sure you're using the xft patched version of lemonbar?
2016-03-07 14:21:18	Kelsar	yes
2016-03-07 14:21:23	Simbaclaws	hmmm odd :/
2016-03-07 14:22:06	Simbaclaws	is there a way of debugging lemonbar with specific fonts? I wouldn't know honestly

2016-03-07 14:24:49	p-x	^andrea^: which browser?
2016-03-07 14:25:22	^andrea^	it can be done easily in firefox but opera and chrome/chromium have removed  that funcionality and they suggest changing it system wide...
2016-03-07 14:25:40	^andrea^	which I don't want to do
2016-03-07 14:25:43	p-x	using command line --proxy=127.0.0.1:9050
2016-03-07 14:26:17	^andrea^	you mean starting the browser everytime with that command instead
2016-03-07 14:26:27	p-x	yes
2016-03-07 14:26:39	^andrea^	is there not a config file somewhere  that can be modified?

2016-03-07 14:42:46	*	Kelsar waiting for his really expensive pizza...
2016-03-07 14:42:49	Somelauw	How can I configure i3 to find my path?
2016-03-07 14:43:06		minnesotags has joined #i3
2016-03-07 14:44:03	m1nty	I put what I wanted in $HOME/.profile then in $HOME/.bash_profile did `source $HOME/.profile` at the bottom :)
2016-03-07 14:44:46	m1nty	idk if that's the right way / best way. You might just need .profile idk. But you definitely gotta log out and log back in
2016-03-07 14:44:59	Somelauw	but I don't use bash
2016-03-07 14:45:07	Kelsar	Somelauw: where did you change your PATH?
2016-03-07 14:45:09	m1nty	i use zsh :3
2016-03-07 14:45:29	Kelsar	and how do you start i3?
2016-03-07 14:45:38	Somelauw	Kelsar: I use lightdm
2016-03-07 14:45:42	m1nty	maybe (?) had trouble with just .profille idk
2016-03-07 14:45:50	Somelauw	I defined my path .xsessionrc
2016-03-07 14:46:15	Kelsar	how?
2016-03-07 14:46:18	Somelauw	roca seems to find the script I want to run, but a keybinding from .i3 doesnt
2016-03-07 14:46:50	m1nty	yeah .. I use zsh .. I haave to have ~/.bash_profile or else it doesn't source .. default  shell  for me is zsh, too
2016-03-07 14:47:18	Kelsar	m1nty: your suggestion would only change path for started shells, not for the X session
2016-03-07 14:47:51	Somelauw	In .xessionrc I have '. ~/.environment', then in .environment I have PATH=~/bin:~/bin/*/:~/.i3/bin:~/.local/bin:~/.gem/ruby/2.1.0/bin:/sbin/:/usr/sbin/:$PATH
2016-03-07 14:47:58	m1nty	huh and nvm I am just having problems all around now for some reason?
2016-03-07 14:48:05	Kelsar	Somelauw: you are missing a "expor"
2016-03-07 14:48:13	Kelsar	export
2016-03-07 14:49:01	Kelsar	either say export PATH=fuu
2016-03-07 14:49:08	Kelsar	or later just export PATH

2016-03-07 14:49:52	Somelauw	oh, I see I already fixed it
2016-03-07 14:50:01	Somelauw	.xsessionrc
2016-03-07 14:50:18	Somelauw	It might be lightdm or even debian specific, I don't know
2016-03-07 14:50:35	Somelauw	I don't have an export in front of PATH
2016-03-07 14:50:51	Kelsar	without export it won't persist for child processes
2016-03-07 14:52:50	m1nty	lol now it is I that has problems with sourcing
2016-03-07 14:53:10	Kelsar	what?!

2016-03-07 15:44:02	Somelauw	Kelsar: sorry, the root of my problem with path as that I was using wildcards in my path, which zsh understands, but xsession probably doesn't.
2016-03-07 15:44:19	Somelauw	and it really works without export
2016-03-07 15:44:38	Kelsar	only for the program you start witch exec itself
2016-03-07 15:50:55	Somelauw	Kelsar: I don't know how to test that
2016-03-07 15:51:07	Somelauw	although putting an export there probably wouldn't hurt anyone

2016-03-07 19:56:57	Illusional	I use mpd + ncmpcpp
2016-03-07 19:57:08	Simbaclaws	yeah I've heard others using that aswell
2016-03-07 19:57:16	Illusional	It's pretty comfy
2016-03-07 19:57:19	Simbaclaws	what config do you use for your i3 with it?
2016-03-07 19:57:30	Simbaclaws	got keybinds for next/prev pause/play?
2016-03-07 19:57:35	Illusional	yeah
2016-03-07 19:57:37	Simbaclaws	cool
2016-03-07 19:57:43	Simbaclaws	I think I'll go with that aswell
2016-03-07 19:57:46	Illusional	I have my media keys bound to control mpc
2016-03-07 19:57:53	Simbaclaws	yeah I thought so :P
2016-03-07 19:57:55	Illusional	and have ncmpcpp open on key 0
2016-03-07 19:58:01	jcalve	same here
2016-03-07 19:58:15	jcalve	other than opening with 0
2016-03-07 19:58:42	Illusional	I just have it run on startup
2016-03-07 19:58:43	Simbaclaws	installing mpd mpc and ncmpcpp
2016-03-07 19:58:58	Simbaclaws	what is ncmpcpp for?
2016-03-07 19:59:07	Illusional	It's a graphical frontend for mpd
2016-03-07 19:59:13	Illusional	mpd is the daemon that plays music
2016-03-07 19:59:21	Illusional	mpc is a command line way to control mpd
2016-03-07 19:59:34	jcalve	it's a bit confusing at the beggining
2016-03-07 19:59:39	Simbaclaws	and the other is the interface?
2016-03-07 19:59:44	Illusional	kinda
2016-03-07 19:59:53	Simbaclaws	I see it's terminal based? no gui
2016-03-07 20:00:18	Simbaclaws	also a visualizer would be cool, in the terminal ofcourse
2016-03-07 20:00:22	strcat	Simbaclaws: mpd is a service, mpc is the official frontend which is cli
2016-03-07 20:00:36	strcat	Simbaclaws: ncmpcpp has that
2016-03-07 20:00:42	Simbaclaws	cool
2016-03-07 20:00:45	Simbaclaws	thanks strcat
2016-03-07 20:01:44	Simbaclaws	hmmm I have my linux distro installed on a usb and would like to add music from the hard drive is this a smart idea to do?
2016-03-07 20:01:56	Simbaclaws	it's a ntfs hard drive
2016-03-07 20:02:23	Simbaclaws	it will probably not find my music on another computer but will it persist? as in I go back to my own computer and it's back
2016-03-07 20:02:26	Illusional	Simbaclaws: use ntfs-3g
2016-03-07 20:02:32	Illusional	that's what I do
2016-03-07 20:02:36	Simbaclaws	ntfs-3g?
2016-03-07 20:02:42	michaelrose	Simbaclaws, don't quite understand what you mean
2016-03-07 20:02:44	Illusional	It's for mounting NTFS
2016-03-07 20:02:51	Simbaclaws	hmm ok
2016-03-07 20:02:59	Simbaclaws	sec, maybe it's already in pcmanfm let me check
2016-03-07 20:03:07	michaelrose	incidentally you are probably already using ntfs-3g by default
2016-03-07 20:03:13	Simbaclaws	yeah it's automatically mounted...
2016-03-07 20:03:20	Simbaclaws	probably :)
2016-03-07 20:03:29	michaelrose	if you look at your fstab and it says ntfs in the filesystem type it is ACTUALLY using ntfs-3g
2016-03-07 20:03:32	michaelrose	mint does that
2016-03-07 20:03:37	Illusional	Simbaclaws: you define the libary in the mpd config
2016-03-07 20:03:52	Simbaclaws	ah ok
2016-03-07 20:04:17	Simbaclaws	hmm kinda forgot where I put my music, gotta search for a bit :P
2016-03-07 20:05:34	Illusional	You can find a guide on how to setup ncmpcpp easily
2016-03-07 20:05:50	Simbaclaws	ok I'll take a look, first let me manage my music for a sec it's all over the place in my drive
2016-03-07 20:06:23	michaelrose	You can organize stuff and tag it automatically with beats

2016-03-07 20:08:35	Simbaclaws	lol seems like I don't have that much music on my drive I think I formatted it some time ago and forgot to download music
2016-03-07 20:09:05	Simbaclaws	pffff gotta download a lot of music now :/
2016-03-07 20:10:02	Simbaclaws	lol I have no idea how to do stuff in ncmpcpp I just wanted to do a browse but I guess I'll have to check the internet :P
2016-03-07 20:10:17	indeedwatson	can i put scripts somewhere to make them show up with rofi?
2016-03-07 20:10:18	Simbaclaws	have no idea about the keybinds
2016-03-07 20:10:26	Illusional	Simbaclaws: check a cheatsheet
2016-03-07 20:10:31	Illusional	or just mash keys until it works
2016-03-07 20:10:33	Simbaclaws	ok will do illusional
2016-03-07 20:10:43	indeedwatson	no, DO NOT mash keys in ncmpcpp
2016-03-07 20:10:47	Simbaclaws	:P
2016-03-07 20:10:49	Simbaclaws	should I?
2016-03-07 20:10:50	Illusional	:^)
2016-03-07 20:10:54	indeedwatson	i almost changed the artist of my entire library once

2016-03-07 20:41:47	Simbaclaws	is it okay to setup mpd with pulse audio?
2016-03-07 20:41:58	Illusional	yes
2016-03-07 20:42:01	Simbaclaws	I am using a ubuntu guide where they are telling me to use pulse instead of alsa
2016-03-07 20:42:04	Simbaclaws	ok good
2016-03-07 20:42:08	Illusional	hmm
2016-03-07 20:42:10	Illusional	I used also
2016-03-07 20:42:13	Illusional	and I use pulseaudio
2016-03-07 20:42:15	Illusional	just try with both
2016-03-07 20:42:20	Illusional	and go with the workign one
2016-03-07 20:44:29	Simbaclaws	hmm when I start mpd it tells me: permission denied

2016-03-07 20:45:05	Illusional	change permissions?
2016-03-07 20:45:07	Illusional	oh
2016-03-07 20:45:13	Illusional	change the config
2016-03-07 20:45:22	Simbaclaws	eeerm what should I change in the config?
2016-03-07 20:45:25	Illusional	use your own config
2016-03-07 20:45:27	Illusional	in .config/mpd
2016-03-07 20:45:35	Simbaclaws	ah so simple cp it
2016-03-07 20:45:49	Illusional	yh
2016-03-07 20:46:29	indeedwatson	what's the difference between alsa and pulse
2016-03-07 20:46:56	Simbaclaws	what the hell, now I get Failed to open ~/.config/mpd/mpd.conf permission denied :/
2016-03-07 20:47:54	michaelrose	basically every sound producing app doesn't need to know how to talk to every sound card in existence so alsa was born a a framework to talk to sound card drivers
2016-03-07 20:48:34	michaelrose	if the sound card doesn't actually handle mixing multiple sources into one , it also does that
2016-03-07 20:49:09	indeedwatson	that reminds me i can't listen to music on mpd and something else at the same time
2016-03-07 20:49:10	michaelrose	this wasn't nearly complicated enough, AND lacked features like sending sound over the network, over blutooth, individual volume levels for each stream
2016-03-07 20:49:42	michaelrose	the ability for multiple streams to be routed to different devices, moved between devices etc
2016-03-07 20:49:47	michaelrose	so pulse was born
2016-03-07 20:50:01	michaelrose	I think it actually uses alsa drivers under the hood
2016-03-07 20:50:13	indeedwatson	maybe i should try pulse
2016-03-07 20:50:33	michaelrose	what distro are you on again?
2016-03-07 20:50:46	indeedwatson	fedora22
2016-03-07 20:50:57	michaelrose	congrats you are already running pulse

2016-03-07 20:51:31	indeedwatson	huh
2016-03-07 20:51:37	indeedwatson	well not with mpd
2016-03-07 20:51:46	indeedwatson	cause the config is set up with alsa
2016-03-07 20:51:55	Simbaclaws	I think I have to change permissions of mpd.conf because I need sudo to even edit it with vim
2016-03-07 20:52:23	Simbaclaws	755 would be enough?
2016-03-07 20:52:45	Simbaclaws	oh wait I made it executable with that xD
2016-03-07 20:54:58	Simbaclaws	ok different issue, now mpd can't access mpd.log :/?
2016-03-07 20:55:03	Simbaclaws	is there something I'm doing wrong?
2016-03-07 20:58:27	indeedwatson	in my experience, if you're having trouble setting up mpd + ncmpcpp, you're on the right path :p
2016-03-07 20:58:50	indeedwatson	did you put the log in the same folder as the .conf?

2016-03-07 21:02:08	Simbaclaws	yeah
2016-03-07 21:02:16	Simbaclaws	and I've made sure the .conf pointed to the log file
2016-03-07 21:02:18	Simbaclaws	it now says this:
2016-03-07 21:02:23	Simbaclaws	errno: failed to open log file "/home/hylke/.config/mpd/mpd.log" (config line 37): Permission denied
2016-03-07 21:02:29	Simbaclaws	and when I do ls -l it shows this:

2016-03-07 21:02:45	Simbaclaws	should I change the ownership to hylke?
2016-03-07 21:03:17	indeedwatson	try
2016-03-07 21:03:32	Simbaclaws	it now says hylke root, does this mean I have to change the group aswell?
2016-03-07 21:03:39	Simbaclaws	how do I change the group?
2016-03-07 21:03:46	Simbaclaws	is there like a chown for group?
2016-03-07 21:03:47	Illusional	chmod
2016-03-07 21:03:54	Illusional	wait no
2016-03-07 21:04:00	Simbaclaws	chmod is for permissions

2016-03-07 21:07:49	Illusional	ignore it
2016-03-07 21:08:55	Simbaclaws	hmm I did sudo killall mpd and this caused the error to dissapear so it was already started
2016-03-07 21:09:11	Simbaclaws	now when I start it it says: Failed to create pid file "/run/mpd/pid" permission denied
2016-03-07 21:09:17	Simbaclaws	should I change the location of my pid file?
2016-03-07 21:09:24	Simbaclaws	like in .config/mpd?

2016-03-07 21:11:49	Illusional	try pressing u

2016-03-07 21:12:29	Simbaclaws	how do I pause it?
2016-03-07 21:12:33	Simbaclaws	the sound is too hard xD
2016-03-07 21:12:52	Simbaclaws	I still have to add a bindsym for my soundlevel
2016-03-07 21:12:55	Illusional	press p to pause
2016-03-07 21:13:34	Simbaclaws	ok seems simple enough
2016-03-07 21:14:08	Illusional	just bindsym your pause media key to mpc toggle

2016-03-08 14:55:17	osse	But seriously though: Factual errors like that don't reflect very well, no matter how harmless (imho)
2016-03-08 14:56:58	Illusional	surely the target audience of i3 would know about freenode, and would find this chan anyway?

2016-03-08 17:59:14	Airblader	Chicken_Wrap: Not really.
2016-03-08 17:59:28	Airblader	Chicken_Wrap: Just don't install it
2016-03-08 17:59:33	Airblader	Chicken_Wrap: Keep the binary local
2016-03-08 17:59:33	Chicken_Wrap	?

2016-03-08 17:59:52	Airblader	yeah
2016-03-08 18:00:08	Airblader	Of course you need to start i3 from the local binary then
2016-03-08 18:00:43	Chicken_Wrap	How would I go about doing that?
2016-03-08 18:01:27	Airblader	Chicken_Wrap: … maybe wait for the PPA. :)

2016-03-08 19:04:10	xpt	in background == without any terminal opened
2016-03-08 19:13:42		p-x has joined #i3
2016-03-08 19:14:07	pllz	well actually running a command from dmenu works... just checked with "echo asd > ~/zzz"
2016-03-08 19:14:25	pllz	so maybe if you don't need interaction you are fine with that
2016-03-08 19:15:19	^andrea^	for example, I'd like to open opera using a proxy
2016-03-08 19:15:45	^andrea^	which means running "opera --proxy=123.123.123.123:8080"
2016-03-08 19:15:53	geosmin	the spacing between my items in i3blocks seems to be broken since the recent update, is this a known issue?

2016-03-08 19:16:06	pllz	^andrea^, and is it working?
2016-03-08 19:16:19	^andrea^	from a normal terminal yes
2016-03-08 19:16:24	^andrea^	not from the dmenu
2016-03-08 19:17:06	^andrea^	I have to open a terminal and then run my alias (eg: operaWithProxy)
2016-03-08 19:17:13	pllz	^andrea^, it should work, i can pass arguments to iceweasel via dmenu
2016-03-08 19:17:21	pllz	but idk opera
2016-03-08 19:17:27	^andrea^	and then I would have an extra  hanging terminal in the background
2016-03-08 19:17:56	^andrea^	ok, tell me what I should type in dmenu please
2016-03-08 19:17:58	pllz	^andrea^, i'd suggest to create a little script and put it in an executable path
2016-03-08 19:18:11	^andrea^	I see
2016-03-08 19:18:21	^andrea^	like? /usr/local/bin/ ?
2016-03-08 19:18:37	pllz	or if you use dmenu_run create a .desktop file and put it where appropriate
2016-03-08 19:18:46	pllz	^andrea^, yeah
2016-03-08 19:19:03	pllz	^andrea^, for my system even ~/bin
2016-03-08 19:19:34	^andrea^	I tried playing with the .desktop file with no luck
2016-03-08 19:19:49	indeedwatson	is there an active bash irc? I'm trying to make a simple script with no success
2016-03-08 19:20:04	^andrea^	but to be honest, I'd much rather user the alias so that I can always open opera normally if I want to
2016-03-08 19:20:25	^andrea^	indeedwatson, try ##linux maybe
2016-03-08 19:20:27	pllz	^andrea^, how would you call the alias?
2016-03-08 19:20:41	^andrea^	right now from the terminal
2016-03-08 19:20:44	xpt	indeedwatson: isn't #bash active?
2016-03-08 19:20:53	indeedwatson	I'll try both
2016-03-08 19:21:13	pllz	no i mean its name...
2016-03-08 19:21:24	pllz	isn't the same for you calling an alias or a script?
2016-03-08 19:21:26	^andrea^	xpt is right, #bash is probably more appropriate, but ##linux is very active...
2016-03-08 19:21:33	^andrea^	sometime even too active! :-D
2016-03-08 19:22:09	^andrea^	from the terminal it would be the same, yes
2016-03-08 19:22:19	^andrea^	but aliases in dmenu don't work
2016-03-08 19:22:29	^andrea^	hopefully scripts will
2016-03-08 19:22:38	pllz	and that's why you should do a script :)

2016-03-08 19:24:03	pllz	oh no, at most you would do a new one
2016-03-08 19:24:09	^andrea^	ok
2016-03-08 19:25:10	pllz	which you can name the same way you are going to name your alias/script :)

2016-03-08 19:31:38	^andrea^	I created a super simple script in /usr/local/bin/operaProxied

2016-03-09 20:59:08	somis	mekhami: as for the i3bar installing the iconic font was all i did to make it work. 
2016-03-09 20:59:43	mekhami	oh you know what i think it is somis
2016-03-09 20:59:54	mekhami	i think the apt-get installs v4.0
2016-03-09 20:59:58	mekhami	and the icons i want are in 4.2+
2016-03-09 21:00:08	somis	omg. 
2016-03-09 21:00:39	somis	that's why it showed the chrome one. i was wondering about the one icon for a while.
2016-03-09 21:02:11	mekhami	hmm that didn't seem to fix anything
2016-03-09 21:02:41	somis	you don't have any other iconic font installed that has the chrome icon?
2016-03-09 21:02:50	mekhami	its entirely possible i do
2016-03-09 21:02:55	mekhami	i've tried several

2016-03-09 21:03:19	mekhami	PowerlineSymbols, terminesspowerline

2016-03-09 21:25:13	mekhami	yeah nothin
2016-03-09 21:25:22	somis	mekhami: i have no other ideas or guesses. maybe someone in #ubuntu knows more :-). good luck

2016-03-09 21:31:43	michaelrose	wasutton3, I don't think you would normally be able to use Super_L
2016-03-09 21:32:23	mekhami	somis: okay now i...
2016-03-09 21:32:28	mekhami	i have working icons excep tfor chrome
2016-03-09 21:32:30	mekhami	which makes sense
2016-03-09 21:32:34	mekhami	because chrome is in 4.4
2016-03-09 21:32:39	mekhami	and fonts-fontawesome is 4.3
2016-03-09 21:32:55	michaelrose	wasutton3, you would want to use Mod4
2016-03-09 21:34:10	michaelrose	Basically alt is Mod1 super or windows is Mod4
2016-03-09 21:35:21	wasutton3	right, windows is mod4
2016-03-09 21:36:30	wasutton3	hey that works! thanks

2016-03-09 21:59:25	somis	maybe upload the config?

2016-03-09 22:35:00	somis	lol
2016-03-09 22:35:46	somis	i can copy your names in my i3 config. (i set the same $worksapce variables and it works. so they're good

2016-03-09 22:38:18	somis	dpkg -s i3-gaps should show the version
2016-03-09 22:44:23	mekhami	4.11
2016-03-09 22:44:27	mekhami	gaps-next
2016-03-09 22:45:41	mekhami	btw dpkg didn't do it, but i3-msg --version did
2016-03-09 22:45:46	mekhami	just for future reference
2016-03-09 22:46:28	somis	mine is i3-gaps-next-git 4.12.5.g3764415-1
2016-03-09 22:46:43	mekhami	yeah but what we're talking about shouldn't have changed in 4.12
2016-03-09 22:46:50	mekhami	4.12 is very recent
2016-03-09 22:47:09	somis	so it's not "old". i thought maybe you miss a feature you use in the config.
2016-03-09 22:47:30	somis	true.
2016-03-09 22:48:47	somis	font pango:Hack Sans Mono 8, FontAwesome
2016-03-09 22:49:19	somis	remove the fontawesome?
2016-03-09 22:49:59	somis	since my config  works without it
2016-03-09 22:50:39	mekhami	mine odes not
2016-03-09 22:51:25	somis	but the "1:" shows again?
2016-03-09 22:51:30	mekhami	no
2016-03-09 22:51:33	mekhami	just icons
2016-03-09 22:51:41	mekhami	but
2016-03-09 22:51:43	mekhami	i didn't move the workspaces
2016-03-09 22:51:46	mekhami	so hold on
2016-03-09 22:51:59	mekhami	yeah nothing

2016-03-09 22:52:45	johnzorn	It seems like some programs force a shadow, how can I prevent this?
2016-03-09 22:52:51	mekhami	nothing
2016-03-09 22:53:28	johnzorn	Example programs that cast a shadow are chromium and mysql-workbench
2016-03-09 22:55:53	johnzorn	chromium incognito doesnt cast the shadow, weird
2016-03-09 22:57:27	somis	mekhami: it worked before? no iconic font and just call a workspace1 "terminal"
2016-03-09 22:58:20	mekhami	sure
2016-03-09 22:58:26	mekhami	with no iconic font i can use text names for workspaces
2016-03-09 22:58:40	somis	ok.
2016-03-09 22:59:50	somis	fonts should be simple. lol sorry i'm bad at font problems. it should be something obvious.
2016-03-09 23:04:18	johnzorn	ok it wasn't i3 but compton...

2016-03-10 12:40:08	mekhami	hi folks. so i'm having this weird problem still where I have a workspaced named "1: " and only the icon shows up, not the '1: '
2016-03-10 12:40:15	mekhami	it happens for all workspaces named this way
2016-03-10 12:40:28	mekhami	https://gist.github.com/mekhami/4f62c646de5aa1003cb9 here's my config file

2016-03-10 13:07:54	qball	bind it to that using i3
2016-03-10 13:08:14	SardemFF7	qball: rofi doesn’t support startup-notification? as a *starter* I mean
2016-03-10 13:08:16	mekhami	i don't know how to make rofi run
2016-03-10 13:08:21	mekhami	so i'm not sure what to bind
2016-03-10 13:08:22	mekhami	qball ^
2016-03-10 13:08:26	qball	bindsym $mod+d exec rofi -show combi
2016-03-10 13:08:42	qball	or -show run
2016-03-10 13:08:45	qball	or -show window
2016-03-10 13:08:49	qball	whatever you want.
2016-03-10 13:09:08		shibari_ has joined #i3
2016-03-10 13:09:11	mekhami	perfect.
2016-03-10 13:09:24	mekhami	thanks
2016-03-10 13:10:14	indeedwatson	qball: some programs take a while to load. Me and someone else here had a problem that you open a program in workspace 1, go to another workspace and since the program is slow, it opens in the current workspace
2016-03-10 13:10:29	indeedwatson	you can prevent this when you execute a program via i3
2016-03-10 13:11:24	qball	aah make a bug report explaining how to wolve this.
2016-03-10 13:11:28	qball	solve
2016-03-10 13:11:38	qball	guess it  needs i3 specific code?
2016-03-10 13:12:01	qball	mekhami: man rofi might have helped
2016-03-10 13:12:07	SardemFF7	qball: no, just startup-notification support, so we have half the code needed already :-)
2016-03-10 13:12:13	qball	aah
2016-03-10 13:12:30	qball	when you execute a program via i3 <-- sounded like i3 ipc
2016-03-10 13:12:38	shibari_	Is there a way to make i3status transparent? I've tried with i3gaps but that actually didn't work for me(I might've done it wrong). Just wondering if i3status bar got the transparency support or is there any workaround?
2016-03-10 13:12:54	indeedwatson	i have no idea how to solve it sorry :(
2016-03-10 13:12:56	SardemFF7	something like "code = sn_get_magic_code(); setenv("MAGIC_CODE", code);"
2016-03-10 13:13:13	qball	SardemFF7: kay will look at it next week
2016-03-10 13:13:15	qball	when in DE
2016-03-10 13:13:48	qball	indeedwatson: still make bug report.
2016-03-10 13:14:34	qball	hmmm cannot repoduce,, machine to quick.
2016-03-10 13:15:08	indeedwatson	i never made a bug report! i'll try :p
2016-03-10 13:15:13	indeedwatson	qball: try with steam

2016-03-10 13:15:19	indeedwatson	tht's bound to be slow to start
2016-03-10 13:15:26	SardemFF7	you can test by running a script that "sleep 3 && xterm" for example
2016-03-10 13:15:57	SardemFF7	I’ll see if I can add it quickly
2016-03-10 13:16:20	qball	kay

According to the website of i3 the maintainer decided to only use a Makefile instead of automake etc. I just wanted to know the reason for this. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to change the build system of i3 but wanted to know what the design decision

2016-03-10 17:41:32	michaelrose	install dmenu or one of its alternatives
2016-03-10 17:41:53	hailhydra	shouldn't I have i3-dmenu-desktop by default?

2016-03-10 17:42:36	hailhydra	I've always had it before but this is a new install
2016-03-10 17:42:55	michaelrose	hailhydra, define don't have it
2016-03-10 17:43:08	okraits	i3 is a window manager and it's up to the distro to decide which packages are a dependency
2016-03-10 17:43:13	michaelrose	does it not exist or do you mean nothing happens with you press mod+d
2016-03-10 17:43:48	michaelrose	if you mean the latter install dmenu
2016-03-10 17:44:06	hailhydra	which says it is in /usr/bin/i3-dmenu-desktop 
2016-03-10 17:44:15	Chicken_Wrap	So you do have it.
2016-03-10 17:44:24	hailhydra	so it looks like mod4+d just doesn't do anything
2016-03-10 17:44:33	michaelrose	did you install dmenu?
2016-03-10 17:44:39	hailhydra	no
2016-03-10 17:44:42	hailhydra	should I>
2016-03-10 17:44:44	hailhydra	?
2016-03-10 17:44:46	Chicken_Wrap	If you want it.
2016-03-10 17:44:49	Chicken_Wrap	And it seems like you do.

2016-03-10 17:45:20	Chicken_Wrap	p-x: You need to make your own review site.
2016-03-10 17:45:23	Chicken_Wrap	I'd visit it.
2016-03-10 17:45:39	hailhydra	k mod4+d works now
2016-03-10 17:45:41	michaelrose	ok look i3-dmenu-desktop is a script which figures out what apps are available and pipes this list to dmenu
2016-03-10 17:45:57	Chicken_Wrap	So everything is solved, hailhydra?
2016-03-10 17:46:05	hailhydra	yup we are all good
2016-03-10 17:46:10	Chicken_Wrap	Great. :^)
2016-03-10 17:46:14	hailhydra	thanks Chicken_Wrap 
2016-03-10 17:46:21	Chicken_Wrap	I didn't really do anything.
2016-03-10 17:46:32	hailhydra	meh you rubber ducked me through it
2016-03-10 17:46:34	Chicken_Wrap	But you're welcome all the same.
2016-03-10 17:47:29	hailhydra	what are some of the more popular launchers?
2016-03-10 17:47:45	michaelrose	forks of dmenu, rofi, synapse
2016-03-10 17:48:03	michaelrose	the latter depends on gnome junk you may or may not want to install
2016-03-10 17:48:09	Chicken_Wrap	Rofi has fuzzy search.
2016-03-10 17:48:14	Ruff	clear
2016-03-10 17:48:26	p-x	rxvt-unicode is the best launcher

2016-03-10 17:51:14	Chicken_Wrap	So Bashrun is just a terminal emulator, but made extra small?
2016-03-10 17:51:22	Chicken_Wrap	Or does it exit after a successful launch?
2016-03-10 17:51:48	michaelrose	i think it hides itself after running the command

2016-03-10 18:33:43	Simbaclaws	how can I make it so that the same key I've binded to rofi also closes rofi? so that I can basically press it once to open rofi and press it again if I want to close it
2016-03-10 18:34:33	Simbaclaws	now if I want to close rofi because I actually didn't want to open a program I would have to press escape
2016-03-10 18:34:37	Simbaclaws	which is quite cumbersome
2016-03-10 18:34:51	michaelrose	Personally I turn capslock into escape

2016-03-10 18:35:47	Simbaclaws	sometimes not always

2016-03-10 18:40:04	michaelrose	basically the button has to start rofi and switch to an i3 mode in which the same key you just pressed is bound to kill rofi and exit the mode
2016-03-10 18:40:32	Simbaclaws	hmmm haven't done much with i3 modes yet I'll have to read up on it
2016-03-10 18:40:48	michaelrose	you really should they are awesome
2016-03-10 18:40:58	michaelrose	but you should probably not bother doing that with rofi
2016-03-10 18:41:06	Simbaclaws	ok
2016-03-10 18:41:10	Simbaclaws	why not though?
2016-03-10 18:41:52	michaelrose	because the number of times you need to leave rofi without running things should be 0.001% of the time
2016-03-10 18:42:27	michaelrose	and I think it might be complicated by rofi grabbing input

2016-03-10 18:42:40	Simbaclaws	well it happens a lot, mostly because my first workspace is almost full and I always forget to make extra workspaces and then I decide not to start it in the first but the second workspace
2016-03-10 18:42:45	brainwash	or a script which runs pgrep/pidof rofi and then either starts rofi or kills it
2016-03-10 18:43:01	michaelrose	the challenge is rofi would actually grab the keys you need
2016-03-10 18:43:35	michaelrose	actually you could probably just bind rofi to have that key leave it
2016-03-10 18:43:57	rawa	michaelrose:

2016-03-10 18:44:30	rawa	Makes caps escape on tap and alt gr on hold

2016-03-10 18:45:38	michaelrose	there is a slight delay
2016-03-10 18:45:38	rawa	brainwash: Not really, it applied escape when you lift the key
2016-03-10 18:46:00	rawa	So if you tap the key, it wont register until you let it go
2016-03-10 18:46:06	brainwash	yeah, thought so. on key release
2016-03-10 18:46:23	rawa	and hold will generate alt gr
2016-03-10 18:46:29	michaelrose	I use vim so I use escape a lot so I don't use xcape on escape(what used to be caps)

2016-03-10 18:48:09	michaelrose	right shift triggers a command mode where only some keys actually exit the command mode
2016-03-10 18:48:39	michaelrose	so if I hit h it focuses one window left but doesn't exit, if I hit ot it opens $appkey-t

2016-03-10 19:31:03	michaelrose	i3-save-tree | sed 's-^\([[:blank:]]*\)//\([[:blank:]]"class".*\),$-\1\2-' > ~/.i3/layouts/{$argv}.json
2016-03-10 19:31:40	michaelrose	it also creates a script file with a shebang in ~/.i3/sessions/name and opens in editor
2016-03-10 19:31:50	michaelrose	and makes it executable
2016-03-10 19:33:04	michaelrose	basically saveme foo creates a layout in ~/.i3/layouts/foo.json and creates a script in ~/.i3/sessions/foo which is immediately opened, you fill in the blanks

2016-03-10 19:39:08	F1skr	Hello guys, I have found what I believe is a bug in the `move` command, the problem is described here: https://github.com/SirCmpwn/sway/pull/500#issuecomment-190809216 my problem is, that I can't find a way to trigger it, it just sort of happens after some time (I'm sure I'm doing something special, I just don't know what). I would like to open an issue but I feel like I need a bit more evidence before it's
2016-03-10 19:39:09		[ http://is.gd/G0sn9L ]

2016-03-10 19:55:02	michaelrose	nope
2016-03-10 19:57:39	michaelrose	actually yes
2016-03-10 19:59:04	michaelrose	didn't notice because I would rarely move stuff between workspaces that way
2016-03-10 20:00:17	michaelrose	more particularly issuing move direction almost always retains focus
2016-03-10 20:01:41	michaelrose	well to be particularly a binding set to move direction does so but rarely fails to do so
2016-03-10 20:02:00	F1skr	For me, once the bug occur, it will always leave focus on the old output, even if I move all windows to another output, that behavior stops when restarting inplace
2016-03-10 20:02:52	F1skr	Then focus will always follow the window to the new output, until it goes wrong again for some reason
2016-03-10 20:03:33	dreamerboy	when i run i3-save-tree i get "Can't locate AnyEvent/I3.pm"
2016-03-10 20:03:52	dreamerboy	the error is on lie 19 where it's written use AnyEvent or smth

2016-03-10 20:04:31	michaelrose	afaik that never happens for me
2016-03-10 20:05:05	F1skr	Right now it does for me, but that's a good point, I will check when I see the bug again
2016-03-10 20:05:10	michaelrose	Requires perl ≥ v5.10, AnyEvent::I3 and JSON::XS

2016-03-10 20:06:32	michaelrose	you must install those perl packages
2016-03-10 20:06:52	michaelrose	ideally through your package manager
2016-03-10 20:06:53	dreamerboy	oh ya
2016-03-10 20:07:12		TheAnachron has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2016-03-10 20:07:53	michaelrose	its dev-perl/JSON-XS and dev-perl/AnyEvent-I3 non gentoo/funtoo people will have different naming schemes
2016-03-10 20:08:10	michaelrose	can be installed via cpan if its not in your repo
2016-03-10 20:08:44	dreamerboy	what in gentoo you install by writing AnyEvent::I3
2016-03-10 20:08:47	dreamerboy	?
2016-03-10 20:09:02	michaelrose	no
2016-03-10 20:09:11	dreamerboy	was curious
2016-03-10 20:09:25	michaelrose	sudo emerge dev-perl/AnyEvent-I3
2016-03-10 20:09:32		notis has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2016-03-10 20:09:36	michaelrose	emerge is like apt
2016-03-10 20:12:11	michaelrose	deb package files are basically a zip like archive with a set of binary files with instructions on where to put them, metadata that tells apt what it needs to install first in order for the package to work, and scripts to run before and after install
2016-03-10 20:12:16	dreamerboy	ya i'm on arch
2016-03-10 20:12:39	dreamerboy	metadata?
2016-03-10 20:13:13	michaelrose	its prebuilt so if anything is compiled you will have one package for each type of processor it supports and debian/ubuntu likes to divide a given library into several different pices
2016-03-10 20:13:31	michaelrose	somelib-dev somelib-help and so forth
2016-03-10 20:14:10	dreamerboy	by processor you mean either x86 or amd?
2016-03-10 20:14:10	michaelrose	gentoo/funtoo use ebuilds which are instructions on how to download and build the package along with the forementioned metadata
2016-03-10 20:14:42	michaelrose	dreamerboy, yes but it breaks down waaay more than that
2016-03-10 20:14:57	dreamerboy	:o
2016-03-10 20:15:04	michaelrose	example https://www.debian.org/ports/
2016-03-10 20:16:02	michaelrose	debian supports 15 different varieties by default unofficial ports include as many more

2016-03-10 20:16:30	dreamerboy	wow
2016-03-10 20:17:31	michaelrose	ebuilds being instructions for building from source only require one ebuild, although gentoo doesn't support as many architectures
2016-03-10 20:17:57	michaelrose	it it has whats called use flags wherein you can define different build settings for a given package
2016-03-10 20:18:30	michaelrose	so if you want a certain package set up differently change a flag and reinstall and you're done
2016-03-10 20:20:09	dreamerboy	it's the way it compile that make it so important
2016-03-10 20:20:34	dreamerboy	or they could make fast algortihm to make it universal
2016-03-10 20:20:56	michaelrose	you could of course do this for software on any distro but building a given package from source and keeping it up to date is inconveinient
2016-03-10 20:20:56	dreamerboy	i've installed json and anyevent still same error
2016-03-10 20:21:19	michaelrose	sure you got the right package?

2016-03-10 21:13:19	Tuxfuk	i'm having a problem with i3 gaps with workspace specific modifiers
2016-03-10 21:14:07	Tuxfuk	if i post my modifiers section of the config and give some more info of the problem, could you guys help me out?
2016-03-10 21:15:10	Tuxfuk	the  funny thing is it worked in workspace 1, but i didnt like it  so i set it to zero, i went to put a small gap 30 mins later and now it hasent taken any of my workspace 1 modifiers
2016-03-10 21:16:03	Tuxfuk	this is the section in question http://pastebin.com/R2VzZZwZ i'm confused why it isnt working when it did in the past
2016-03-10 21:16:49	michaelrose	gaps is a fork of i3
2016-03-10 21:17:18	Tuxfuk	that is correct
2016-03-10 21:17:39	michaelrose	its not actually a supported feature would refer to the home page of the fork for correct syntax
2016-03-10 21:17:45	Tuxfuk	per instructions i emerged i3, then compiled i3 gaps

2016-03-10 21:32:04	michaelrose	idle curiousity anyone who is paying attention please say gaps or regular depending on what you are running

2016-03-10 21:34:41	somis	gaps
2016-03-10 21:36:32	michaelrose	basically gaps provides a few additional features most notably gaps between windows which some people prefer aesteticly and others feel are a waste of time
2016-03-10 21:37:02	dreamerboy	regular
2016-03-10 21:37:23	michaelrose	regular, I prefer to use my pixels for drawing my apps
2016-03-10 21:37:30	dreamerboy	eactly
2016-03-10 21:37:53	dreamerboy	well gaps is good if you have few big screen
2016-03-10 21:38:24	michaelrose	I also couldn't get it to draw the 1 pixel highlight around my focused app when I tried it

2016-03-10 21:39:16	Tuxfuk	so much lighter, too
2016-03-10 21:39:21	dreamerboy	oh michaelrose i img-msg border none but there is still 1px border how can I use it to highlight?
2016-03-10 21:40:31	michaelrose	border is what I meant
2016-03-10 21:40:56	dreamerboy	like highlight when we select the window
2016-03-10 21:41:07	michaelrose	as in the focused window has a different color 1pixel border
2016-03-10 21:41:18	dreamerboy	ya
2016-03-10 21:41:20	michaelrose	good for not closing the wrong app accidentally
2016-03-10 21:42:08	dreamerboy	when I'll be decent i'll code it so my bg is black when not selected and grey when selected
2016-03-10 21:42:30	somis	dreamerboy: you just use a color for client.focused  border. the example in the i3 docs should have that.
2016-03-10 21:43:13	michaelrose	grey is hard to see
2016-03-10 21:43:23	michaelrose	unless your border is fairly wide
2016-03-10 21:43:46	dreamerboy	well in my them  I clearly see the difference between my grey g and black border

2016-03-10 21:45:53	michaelrose	a lot of cool stuff is in behavior and workflow as opposed to stuff that is visually obvious
2016-03-10 21:46:59	somis	i use 2px grey for active and transparent inactive borders.

2016-03-11 20:54:47	ddelony	I installed i3 in Ubuntu, but it showed an Ubuntu background when I logged in.
2016-03-11 20:56:04	Simbaclaws	ddelony have you tried replacing it with feh?
2016-03-11 20:56:59		raphyduck has joined #i3
2016-03-11 20:58:56	ddelony	The login manager?
2016-03-11 20:59:07	Simbaclaws	oh it's the background of your login manager?
2016-03-11 20:59:33	ddelony	It's not a dealbreaker. Just a little odd. I can probably change it in the configuration file.
2016-03-11 20:59:55	Simbaclaws	you mean the desktop wallpaper or the login manager wallpaper?
2016-03-11 21:00:09	Simbaclaws	because the desktop wallpaper can be changed with something like feh
2016-03-11 21:00:14	ddelony	The login manager wallpaper. I believe Ubuntu uses lightdm.
2016-03-11 21:00:21	Simbaclaws	hmm ok sec
2016-03-11 21:00:41	ddelony	It's only a VM anyway.
2016-03-11 21:00:41	Simbaclaws	do you have a application called login window?
2016-03-11 21:00:55	Simbaclaws	there you should be able to change the theme
2016-03-11 21:02:06	Simbaclaws	do you have i3-dmenu-desktop? if you do you should be able to launch dmenu and type login window
2016-03-11 21:02:24	Simbaclaws	or rofi running as dmenu for that matter
2016-03-11 21:02:35	Simbaclaws	something that recognizes application names from desktop files

2016-03-12 17:00:19	Illusional	peteyy: I think it's because gaps go against the i3 philosophy

2016-03-12 17:00:48	somis	crahan1: i use i3blocks. try and ask. maybe others use it too.
2016-03-12 17:01:12	peteyy	Illusional: but if that is an optional extension I don't get why is that a bad thing

2016-03-12 17:01:43	Illusional	peteyy: because i3 is about making the maximum use out of your screenspace
2016-03-12 17:01:49	Illusional	gaps defeat the point of that
2016-03-12 17:01:57	crahan1	somis: in the i3status.conf i use this : format_up = "Wifi: %ip@%essid (%quality)"  for the wifi format, but i did found a "format" propertie for wifi in i3blocks, is there one ?
2016-03-12 17:02:45	crahan1	it just displays "ip.ip.ip.ip xx%" without ssid
2016-03-12 17:02:46	peteyy	Illusional: do you use gaps? :)
2016-03-12 17:02:54	Illusional	peteyy: yup :^)
2016-03-12 17:03:14	peteyy	Illusional: does it miss anything, or commits get pulled from upstream?
2016-03-12 17:03:31	Illusional	peteyy: I'm pretty sure airblader also works with i3
2016-03-12 17:03:38	Illusional	so it's up to date
2016-03-12 17:03:45	Illusional	I'm pretty sure it had 4.12 before vanilla i3
2016-03-12 17:03:58	peteyy	so it's even moving faster
2016-03-12 17:04:20	peteyy	I gave it a try a couple minutes ago but I was not feeling too efficient on a 13" laptop
2016-03-12 17:04:27	peteyy	maybe it's good for bigger ones
2016-03-12 17:04:37	Illusional	It depends what size it is
2016-03-12 17:04:49	Illusional	It's ok on my 13" as I just have small gaps in between
2016-03-12 17:04:53	Illusional	to make things prettier
2016-03-12 17:05:01	jj53k__	Illusional: thanks, just read your advice, worked well.

2016-03-13 14:13:32	bashnoob	pllz: I see lots of screenshots where people are using the non-default round thingy, so I was wondering if that's possible.. Are you sure?
2016-03-13 14:14:38	pllz	bashnoob, well you question is not clear enough... you may manage to use a ascreenshot taken at the time the i3lock launches, and use that as background image (maybe applying some effects to it)
2016-03-13 14:15:42	pllz	but if you want to see the windows running a script (that is what i understood from your question), i'm not aware of this possibility
2016-03-13 14:16:05	bashnoob	pllz: no, that wont do it.  Are there any lockscreen applications compatible with i3 that are able to do this?
2016-03-13 14:16:50	pllz	bashnoob, to be clear, do you want a "transparent" lock screen then?
2016-03-13 14:17:37	pllz	bashnoob, what images are you referring to?
2016-03-13 14:18:31	bashnoob	I don't understand - I want something like i3lock which goes "on top" but with an i3 window running instead of the round thing

2016-03-13 17:43:58	abs25	now I am not sure if I must run the programs alone or layout will do that?
2016-03-13 17:43:59	somis	abs25: uncomment the "things" under "swallows". then try and see if your programm gets swallowed in the container.
2016-03-13 17:44:57	somis	you append the layout then run the program which then if the "swollow" matches gets in the container.
2016-03-13 17:45:37	somis	abs25: and if it stays the same you can automate it.
2016-03-13 17:45:46	abs25	somis: I run program from i3 config layout itself wont run it?
2016-03-13 17:46:01	abs25	its always the same, I want it to be launched on boot
2016-03-13 17:46:08	somis	try. it gives you "black boxes"
2016-03-13 17:46:17	abs25	yes gives me black boxes
2016-03-13 17:46:41	abs25	known bug?
2016-03-13 17:47:03	somis	no. (it does that since i use it)
2016-03-13 17:47:38	eeemsi_	might it be a bug that if one switches from fullscreen video (chromium) to another workspace that this workspace does not update?
2016-03-13 17:48:21	abs25	somis: why it does that though, also it doesnt alignem them  properly
2016-03-13 17:48:25	somis	now launch something and if the swallow-criteria matches it should go in a "black-box".

2016-03-13 17:54:10	abs25	Somelauw: thats the thing, there is no inside htop alsamixer or weechat
2016-03-13 17:54:20	abs25	even though I generated layout while they were open its weird
2016-03-13 17:54:23	abs25	I just placed them in instances

2016-03-13 17:54:31	abs25	just need default font name for i3
2016-03-13 17:54:36	abs25	its failing to load custom ones I set
2016-03-13 17:54:40	Somelauw	terminals are more difficult
2016-03-13 17:55:21	Somelauw	fire up terminals with the program running, otherwise if you use tmux, you can use tmuxinator
2016-03-13 17:56:06	Somelauw	make sure terminals rename window title to whatever you are running in it
2016-03-13 17:56:53	abs25	eh idk how to do that Somelauw , anyway why it cant find the font I am providing it?
2016-03-13 17:56:56	abs25	i3 config

2016-03-13 19:16:15	wwalker	It seems I would need a way to find out what the current container's mark is.  is there an easy way to do this, or would I have to write an api app?

2016-03-15 13:57:37	Inv1s1ble	Hey question, so I have cups with zeroconf compiled in. I need to setup a network printer (company's network). I know the hostname/IP but it's an Cannon Image runner and I can't figure out the queue name. Sending Postscript to its Jetdirect port doesn't work. All the guides out there for detecting printers rely on Gnome/KDE GUIs I don't have/want to install
2016-03-15 13:58:01	Neko`	cups :/
2016-03-15 13:58:03	Inv1s1ble	Are there any command line tools or lightweight GUIs for setting cup CUPS printers via autoconf?
