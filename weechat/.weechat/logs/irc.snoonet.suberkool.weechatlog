2016-01-03 23:09:52	inddwtsn	ty :)
2016-01-03 23:09:58	Suberkool	idk why I just didn't want to put my full name on the public irc :)
2016-01-03 23:10:26	inddwtsn	for the longest time i thought it was Swole and that it was a joke last name
2016-01-03 23:10:29	Suberkool	even though it probably would've been fine lol
2016-01-03 23:10:39	Suberkool	I know hahaha
2016-01-03 23:11:10	inddwtsn	i never put my full name on irc either
2016-01-03 23:11:13	inddwtsn	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2016-01-03 23:11:46	Suberkool	:) ok cool, I'm not crazy then :)
2016-01-03 23:12:01	Suberkool	remember when you got on hangouts for like ten seconds and waved
2016-01-03 23:12:40	inddwtsn	yes how could i forget
2016-01-03 23:13:15	Suberkool	"the rise, rule, and fall of inddwtsn lasted a solid ten seconds, hope you didn't miss it but you probably did"
2016-01-03 23:13:28	inddwtsn	haha
2016-01-03 23:13:35	inddwtsn	are those still going on regularly?
2016-01-03 23:14:49	Suberkool	kind of, like I've made some pretty good friends through all of this, and we skype pretty often now, but a full on hangout through irc with new people and stuff seems to only happen every couple weeks
2016-01-03 23:15:07	inddwtsn	oh nice
2016-01-03 23:15:36	Suberkool	I wish it happened more. I love when some one new comes on
2016-01-03 23:15:53	Suberkool	it'a fun to meet a new person
2016-01-03 23:16:05	Suberkool	oOoOOOH SHINY
2016-01-03 23:16:55	inddwtsn	we haven't had many new regulars in irc lately
2016-01-03 23:16:58	inddwtsn	shiny wat
2016-01-03 23:18:51	inddwtsn	have you worked out today
2016-01-03 23:23:40	Suberkool	ok true. we are the same. we need fresh bloops
2016-01-03 23:23:58	Suberkool	ohh shiny is how I feel when there's a new person on hangouts :)
2016-01-03 23:24:17	Suberkool	I'm going to train in about an hour. you? how often do you train ? what are you goals ?
2016-01-03 23:25:14	inddwtsn	oh nice
2016-01-03 23:25:29	inddwtsn	how's your shoulder? you had some pain there right?
2016-01-03 23:25:35	Suberkool	haha I said fresh bloops
2016-01-03 23:25:42	Suberkool	but I meant fresh blood
2016-01-03 23:25:43	Suberkool	haha
2016-01-03 23:25:51	Suberkool	what if we called all new people bloops
2016-01-03 23:25:54	inddwtsn	im training 3 times a week, goals are better HS and idk, just be stronger and not fat
2016-01-03 23:26:03	inddwtsn	hahah yeah i thought that was just you being crazy
2016-01-03 23:26:14	inddwtsn	we should do that, start calling people bloops out of nowhere
2016-01-03 23:26:48	Suberkool	well yeah I think I actually would say something random like that so you've got my figured out. actually, my goals probably can be summed as the way you sum yours lol. "be stronger and not fat"
2016-01-03 23:27:08	Suberkool	*got me
2016-01-03 23:27:50	Suberkool	shoulder still needs specific rehab probably forever. but just two weeks of rehab and I was able to get my first pull up.
2016-01-03 23:28:06	inddwtsn	wow nice
2016-01-03 23:28:16	inddwtsn	did i ask how you hurt it? i dont recall
2016-01-03 23:28:20	Suberkool	are you seeing continual strength progression? you've been training for a while now, I imagine you are hitting some stalls
2016-01-03 23:29:20	Suberkool	yeah I don't know how it happened. well I think it was from a benching "accident" but I'm not sure 100%. but it started flaring up after continual handstand practice last summer
2016-01-03 23:29:33	inddwtsn	ye, my pullups are just impossible to improve, i think that's part of why my trainer put me on circuits, to be less stressed about reps
2016-01-03 23:30:05	Suberkool	so then I stopped handstand practice. also hanging leg lifts hurt too. so basically that's why I kind of quit bwf
2016-01-03 23:30:09	Suberkool	and started lifting more
2016-01-03 23:30:24	inddwtsn	interesting
2016-01-03 23:30:34	Suberkool	do you add weights to your pull-ups ?
2016-01-03 23:30:44	inddwtsn	i did at some point
2016-01-03 23:30:51	inddwtsn	but now im not doing weighted anything
2016-01-03 23:31:01	Suberkool	also, I think minimizing stress with training is important. mental health above all else
2016-01-03 23:31:19	inddwtsn	yeah i felt like qutting often, or at least quitting pullups
2016-01-03 23:32:55	Suberkool	why?
2016-01-03 23:33:53	Suberkool	I didn't train for 2-3 weeks this last month in order to recenter myself and be healthy mentally/emotionally. I'm so glad I did it dear god. the strength loss and fat gain sucks but shmeh. worth it in the long run
2016-01-03 23:34:21	inddwtsn	mostly it was that one time that i hit like 10, 8, 6, 6, 4 pullups, and then about 2 weeks later i basically lost the 1st set, so lost 10 reps for apparently no reason, and i was really frustrated
2016-01-03 23:34:52	inddwtsn	i don't think you would've lost much muscle in just 3 weeks
2016-01-03 23:36:28	Suberkool	ah yes. it's easy to get trapped in negative thinking/"failure". and then beat yourself up about it, be discouraged, and then freeze and feel like quitting
2016-01-03 23:36:54	Suberkool	yeah my lifts went down about 5 lbs each so not too bad.
2016-01-03 23:37:11	inddwtsn	what lifts do you do
2016-01-03 23:37:39	Suberkool	well this is all of it:
2016-01-03 23:39:25	Suberkool	pull ups, DB rows, DB bench press, tricep push downs, chest flys, ohp, back squats, lunges, RDL's, barbell glute bridges, front squat
2016-01-03 23:40:01	Suberkool	see it's basically body building not really bwf anymore lol. I see myself in the future, when I'm leaner and stronger, transitioning back to more cool body weight stuff
2016-01-03 23:40:25	Suberkool	what does your routine look like?? we've talked about it briefly but if you have more detail id be interested to know !
2016-01-03 23:40:27	inddwtsn	thats nice
2016-01-03 23:40:36	inddwtsn	do you miss bwf skills?
2016-01-03 23:42:56	inddwtsn	i warmup, then HS (sometimes chest to wall, sometimes back to wall), then elbow lever or frogstand, and then the circuits are: A) hollow body pushups, pullups, shrimp squat, hollow hold; B) Elevated pike pushup, tuck front lever pulls, pistol squats, arch hold. And then some light stretching
2016-01-03 23:43:06	inddwtsn	I alternate A and B 
2016-01-03 23:52:03	Suberkool	yeah you are like full on body weight purist!
2016-01-03 23:52:19	Suberkool	do you consider using weights for like squats ?
2016-01-03 23:52:31	Suberkool	yep I miss practicing handstands the most :(
2016-01-03 23:52:50	inddwtsn	i only have two 7kg dumbbells... so it's not gonna do much for squats, and I never been to a gym
2016-01-03 23:52:56	inddwtsn	i should go but im so lazy
2016-01-03 23:53:12	Suberkool	when I was depressed last year, practicing handstands everyday was literally the only thing I looked forward to, what kept me going one more day :p
2016-01-03 23:53:36	Suberkool	you mentioned you have a trainer, is it not a trainer at a gym?
2016-01-03 23:53:43	inddwtsn	you're gonna make me do hs now
2016-01-03 23:53:54	inddwtsn	no, it's online with a meeting every 3 weeks
2016-01-03 23:54:25	Suberkool	yeah you have to do them! do them because I can't lol.
2016-01-03 23:54:33	Suberkool	yay for online training
2016-01-03 23:54:46	Suberkool	Alex is my trainer. and that's all online obviously. and it works
2016-01-03 23:54:52	Suberkool	so I'm happy about it.
2016-01-03 23:55:03	inddwtsn	ok gonna warmup my wrists
2016-01-03 23:55:05	Suberkool	I feel so fucking lucky to have met all of you I'm so serious
2016-01-03 23:55:12	inddwtsn	i should've done this earlier
2016-01-03 23:55:16	inddwtsn	:D
2016-01-03 23:55:42	Suberkool	yeah before I train I'm going to sprint, and do my shoulder rehab. 5 more minutes and I'll get off my lazy ass.
2016-01-03 23:55:53	Suberkool	THE INTERNET RULES
2016-01-03 23:56:19	inddwtsn	it totally does
2016-01-03 23:56:32	inddwtsn	how long does the rehab take you
2016-01-03 23:57:37	Suberkool	just long enough that I feel like it's too long lol
2016-01-03 23:57:41	Suberkool	15 minutes
2016-01-03 23:58:54	inddwtsn	that's not bad
2016-01-03 23:59:15	inddwtsn	im lucky i never had shoulder problems
2016-01-03 23:59:25	inddwtsn	somewhat wrists and elbows but not shoulders
2016-01-04 00:05:48	Suberkool	I swear like...EVERYBODY has shoulder issues
2016-01-04 00:06:08	Suberkool	I'm lucky I never had wrist issues, I suppose :)

2016-01-04 00:07:08	Suberkool	haha you guys all force me to learn military time
2016-01-04 00:07:30	inddwtsn	tho not pronounced the same as "person from Germany"
2016-01-04 00:07:39	inddwtsn	it's more like Herrman idk
2016-01-04 00:07:52	inddwtsn	yes, 24h clock is better!
2016-01-04 00:07:58	inddwtsn	now learn metric too 
2016-01-04 00:08:17	Suberkool	I'm definitely more familiar with metric because of irc lol
2016-01-04 00:08:42	Suberkool	it's let's see...let me translate my time...17:00?
2016-01-04 00:08:52	inddwtsn	so 5pm?
2016-01-04 00:08:53	Suberkool	7 hours past noon
2016-01-04 00:08:57	Suberkool	oh damn
2016-01-04 00:09:01	inddwtsn	haha
2016-01-04 00:09:05	Suberkool	see I still don't have it down
2016-01-04 00:09:09	Suberkool	19:00 :)
2016-01-04 00:09:27	inddwtsn	yes, so 5 hours before me
2016-01-04 00:09:51	Suberkool	so ether you're up really late or up really early
2016-01-04 00:10:15	inddwtsn	i wouldn't call it really late, i normally go to be around 2am
2016-01-04 00:10:41	inddwtsn	unless i work the next day, in which case i go around 11pm or a bit later
2016-01-04 00:18:19	Suberkool	haha sounds like my weekend schedule
2016-01-04 00:18:31	Suberkool	on NYE, I stayed up until 7am
2016-01-04 00:19:07	Suberkool	which is...what time in military time...
2016-01-04 00:19:30	inddwtsn	7
2016-01-04 00:19:32	inddwtsn	lol
2016-01-04 00:19:38	Suberkool	700?
2016-01-04 00:19:50	inddwtsn	everything before pm is the same
2016-01-04 00:19:55	Suberkool	oh
2016-01-04 00:20:04	inddwtsn	i mean, in true military time, i dont know
2016-01-04 00:20:14	inddwtsn	but the way we say it here is just 7
2016-01-04 00:20:20	Suberkool	military time and 24 hour are different ?
2016-01-04 00:20:25	inddwtsn	yes
2016-01-04 00:20:34	inddwtsn	at least in practice
2016-01-04 00:20:35	Suberkool	sigh.
2016-01-04 00:20:38	Suberkool	I give up
2016-01-04 00:20:43	inddwtsn	i guess the saying out loud is different
2016-01-04 00:20:49	inddwtsn	cause when it
2016-01-04 00:21:06	inddwtsn	it's 19, we still say "it's seven" out loud
2016-01-04 00:21:22	Suberkool	wow
2016-01-04 00:21:31	Suberkool	complicated
2016-01-04 00:21:37	Suberkool	I'll have to figure it out though
2016-01-04 00:21:53	Suberkool	probably would only take one hour of concentration to learn it
2016-01-04 00:22:16	inddwtsn	it's not a very useful skill to learn lol
2016-01-04 00:22:37	Suberkool	it is for when I travel outside of the US though
2016-01-04 00:23:16	inddwtsn	do you do that often
2016-01-04 00:27:50	Suberkool	haha no. but I will
2016-01-04 00:28:05	Suberkool	do you want to travel out of Argentina
2016-01-04 00:28:14	Suberkool	so do you speak
2016-01-04 00:29:16	Suberkool	Spanish? seriously that could be an extremely ignorant I have no fucking clue. I don't actually know what Argentina's national language is. fuck it's probably Argentinian if that's a language
2016-01-04 00:29:35	Suberkool	I'M DUMB AMERICAN HEAR ME ROAR
2016-01-04 00:30:04	Suberkool	I'm going to train I'll check back later
2016-01-04 00:35:45	inddwtsn	hahahaha
2016-01-04 00:35:50	inddwtsn	yes spanish
