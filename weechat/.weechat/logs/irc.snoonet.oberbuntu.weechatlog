2015-10-15 20:57:22	Oberbuntu	bruv
2015-10-15 20:57:42	indeedwatson	wut
2015-10-15 20:58:03	Oberbuntu	have you tried tinder by you
2015-10-15 20:58:12	Oberbuntu	i just installed it this morning
2015-10-15 20:58:19	Oberbuntu	it's so easy dude
2015-10-15 20:58:32	Oberbuntu	and i've been talking to a few qtsloots all day
2015-10-15 21:00:08	indeedwatson	i dont wanna use fb for it
2015-10-15 21:00:22	Oberbuntu	why?
2015-10-15 21:00:49	indeedwatson	i don't like fb
2015-10-15 21:00:55	indeedwatson	i don't wanna have a pic of me
2015-10-15 21:01:01	indeedwatson	and a full decent profile
2015-10-15 21:01:16	Oberbuntu	there isn't a profile really
2015-10-15 21:01:34	Oberbuntu	and you can set a picture on fb that's permission is set to only you
2015-10-15 21:01:39	Oberbuntu	and then use that for tinder
2015-10-15 21:01:49	Oberbuntu	and it uses your likes
2015-10-15 21:01:53	indeedwatson	i dont like login into shit with fb
2015-10-15 21:01:56	Oberbuntu	that's basically it
2015-10-15 21:02:38	Oberbuntu	meh you do you
2015-10-15 21:02:38	indeedwatson	that and fb having access to all your flirty tinder convos
2015-10-15 21:02:49	Oberbuntu	does fb own tinder?
2015-10-15 21:03:04	indeedwatson	dunno
2015-10-15 21:03:08	indeedwatson	but they don't need to
2015-10-15 21:03:11	Oberbuntu	don't think so
2015-10-15 21:03:26	Oberbuntu	and using fb for auth doesn't give them access to other things from the app
2015-10-15 21:03:32	Oberbuntu	that's totally illogical
2015-10-15 21:04:09	indeedwatson	why does it even require fb
2015-10-15 21:04:28	Oberbuntu	to lessen how many duplicate accts get made
2015-10-15 21:04:45	Oberbuntu	because fb has better acct creation standards than what most startups can cook up
2015-10-15 21:06:41	indeedwatson	and what does fb get in return
2015-10-15 21:07:26	Oberbuntu	to know when people are logged into an app and higher acct retention on their own site because other things that their users depend on are tied to their mainland fb acct
2015-10-15 21:08:33	indeedwatson	why would you trust fb tho
2015-10-15 21:08:45	Oberbuntu	trust?
2015-10-15 21:08:47	Oberbuntu	trust how
2015-10-15 21:09:22	indeedwatson	that they're just doing that and not snooping on messages for data
2015-10-15 21:09:55	Oberbuntu	because i've used their api before and i understand what oauth2 is and how it's implemented -_-
2015-10-15 21:10:04	Oberbuntu	what you're saying doesn't make sense
2015-10-15 21:10:13	Oberbuntu	it sounds like some fox news fear mongering
2015-10-15 21:11:03	Oberbuntu	using fb oauth doesn't give fb access to the app's servers at all
2015-10-15 21:11:11	Oberbuntu	it's a 3rd party library/sdk
2015-10-15 21:11:14	indeedwatson	have you never had fb ads about something you googled recently
2015-10-15 21:11:38	Oberbuntu	i have
2015-10-15 21:11:52	Oberbuntu	but i also understand how ad networks work
2015-10-15 21:11:57	Oberbuntu	and you're being paranoid
2015-10-15 21:12:46	Oberbuntu	ad networks only work like that because you allow them to run and see so much of your web traffic from their iframes on the front end
2015-10-15 21:13:09	indeedwatson	https://np.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/3nxjwt/discussion_facebook_listening_to_conversations/
2015-10-15 21:13:30	Oberbuntu	ad networks are totally separate from fb as auth
2015-10-15 21:13:51	Oberbuntu	the only way they intersect is browser fingerprinting
2015-10-15 21:13:54	Oberbuntu	to isolate you
2015-10-15 21:14:33	indeedwatson	so tinder doesn't ask for your fb pass?
2015-10-15 21:15:21	Oberbuntu	it asks for you to authorize with facebook yeah, but it has facebook deal with that
2015-10-15 21:15:59	indeedwatson	mm, last thing i used oauth with fb generated a pass for that app
2015-10-15 21:16:32	Oberbuntu	we don't use oauth anymore it's all oauth2
2015-10-15 21:16:45	Oberbuntu	and fb using your mic would need to be the fb app itself
2015-10-15 21:16:58	Oberbuntu	not authorization in another app
2015-10-15 21:17:01	indeedwatson	ye
2015-10-15 21:17:09	indeedwatson	im just saying the kind of shit fb does
2015-10-15 21:17:18	indeedwatson	so i dont trust it or like it
2015-10-15 21:17:24	Oberbuntu	#yolo
2015-10-15 21:17:27	Oberbuntu	everyone does it
2015-10-15 21:17:29	indeedwatson	and even less when other apps force me to use it
2015-10-15 21:17:35	indeedwatson	that's the most bs excuse
2015-10-15 21:17:36	Oberbuntu	it's unavoidable
2015-10-15 21:18:04	indeedwatson	meh
2015-10-15 21:18:13	indeedwatson	literally only talk to 2 people there
2015-10-15 21:18:20	indeedwatson	one of which i talk somewhere else too
2015-10-15 21:18:26	indeedwatson	and another who i haven't talked in a while
2015-10-15 21:18:58	Oberbuntu	regardless it's cool
2015-10-15 21:19:09	indeedwatson	fb?
2015-10-15 21:19:10	indeedwatson	or tinder
2015-10-15 21:19:11	indeedwatson	?
2015-10-15 21:19:23	Oberbuntu	it forces the sloots to concede some to swipe people right and be proactive in that way
2015-10-15 21:19:30	Oberbuntu	so it's nice that way
2015-10-15 21:19:47	indeedwatson	it also forces to judge quick on appearance alone
2015-10-15 21:20:01	Oberbuntu	you can assume that they are talking to less people that way because they aren't being bombarded with messages
2015-10-15 21:20:08	Oberbuntu	yeah but that's kind of a good thing i think
2015-10-15 21:20:14	Oberbuntu	appearance is important
2015-10-15 21:20:29	indeedwatson	but it's literally the most important, and only important thing for the app
2015-10-15 21:21:33	Oberbuntu	right and if a grill matches you, you can feel free to be you because she already finds you physically attractive
2015-10-15 21:21:46	Oberbuntu	you know you can get away with a lot more in this scenario
2015-10-15 21:22:23	indeedwatson	meh, same applies in okc
2015-10-15 21:22:26	indeedwatson	just go full chad
2015-10-15 21:22:34	indeedwatson	pls tell me you've seen chad 
2015-10-15 21:25:24	Oberbuntu	i know what a chad is
2015-10-15 21:25:38	Oberbuntu	but i'm not sure i fully know what you're talking about
2015-10-15 21:25:53	Oberbuntu	i'm sure i've read a chad thundercock greentext before
2015-10-15 21:31:04	indeedwatson	http://imgur.com/gallery/F9hRS
2015-10-15 21:39:06	Oberbuntu	prolly gonna diaper up and watch some cartoons B)
2015-10-15 21:39:10	Oberbuntu	jesus that's funny

2015-10-15 21:40:21	Oberbuntu	lol i'm not good looking enough to get away with such things
2015-10-15 21:40:24	Oberbuntu	not even close
2015-10-15 21:41:05	indeedwatson	just grow lats
2015-10-15 21:41:50	indeedwatson	so when are you meeting tg

2015-10-15 21:50:18	Oberbuntu	kinda don't feel like messaging her to see where we're going
2015-10-15 21:50:29	indeedwatson	just fucking do it
2015-10-15 21:50:57	Oberbuntu	maybe
2015-10-15 21:51:27	indeedwatson	or you can stay home and fap to midget porn again

2015-10-15 21:53:04	Oberbuntu	sexing a tall grill is on the bucket list for sure
2015-10-15 21:53:50	Oberbuntu	if we are meeting that means i have to take a nap
2015-10-15 21:53:56	Oberbuntu	she doesn't get off work till 11

2015-10-15 21:55:52	Oberbuntu	nah this would just be meeting up for coffee or something and talking
2015-10-15 21:56:03	Oberbuntu	all we've had is super nerdy talks about philosophy and astrophysics

2015-10-15 21:58:48	Oberbuntu	that sounds like good plan right
2015-10-15 21:59:29	indeedwatson	why would you not wanna
2015-10-15 21:59:36	indeedwatson	a cute tall female wants to talk to you irl

2015-10-15 22:06:26	indeedwatson	not it's not
2015-10-15 22:06:30	indeedwatson	it's running away
2015-10-15 22:07:00	Oberbuntu	it's not running away it's making it so that i can actually get coffee tonight wihtout falling asleep on the grill
2015-10-15 22:07:13	indeedwatson	maybe she likes that
2015-10-15 22:07:19	indeedwatson	wants to touch youy while you sleep
2015-10-15 22:07:34	Oberbuntu	i'd be okay with that
2015-10-15 22:07:41	Oberbuntu	though not on a first date ;)
2015-10-15 22:08:47	Oberbuntu	wow

2015-10-15 22:10:20	Oberbuntu	s/sleep/nap
2015-10-15 22:11:16	indeedwatson	from interacting with a female
2015-10-15 22:12:52	Oberbuntu	that's potentially after napping
2015-10-15 22:12:55	Oberbuntu	but whatever
2015-10-15 22:12:56	Oberbuntu	nn
2015-10-15 22:16:16	Â«	Oberbuntu (OberonTheSe@Snoonet-n2p.rvp.rahg2g.IP) has quit (Quit: http://www.kiwiirc.com/ - A hand crafted IRC client)
2015-10-15 23:23:45	Oberbuntu	nigga
2015-10-15 23:23:48	Oberbuntu	i can't sleep
2015-10-15 23:23:56	Oberbuntu	i think it's the curse of the watson sham
2015-10-15 23:23:59	Oberbuntu	shame
2015-10-15 23:24:00	Oberbuntu	-_-
2015-10-15 23:30:05	indeedwatson	wut
2015-10-15 23:30:23	Oberbuntu	knowing that you were dissapoint
2015-10-15 23:30:36	indeedwatson	so you already know you won't see her
2015-10-15 23:30:51	Oberbuntu	i just messaged her to see if she's still down
2015-10-15 23:30:55	Oberbuntu	and she said yeah
2015-10-15 23:31:10	indeedwatson	then i won't be disappoint
2015-10-15 23:36:18	Oberbuntu	ugh this is too much work
2015-10-15 23:36:29	Oberbuntu	i could have jacked off in about 15 minutes
2015-10-15 23:36:33	indeedwatson	stop fucking whinning
2015-10-15 23:36:42	Oberbuntu	and then gone to get dinner and watched some bjj on youtube
2015-10-15 23:36:44	Oberbuntu	called it a night
2015-10-15 23:36:52	Oberbuntu	lol why
2015-10-15 23:37:02	indeedwatson	would you not give up all that for a kiss
2015-10-15 23:37:15	Oberbuntu	a kiss? prob would not give that up for a kiss
2015-10-15 23:38:35	Oberbuntu	watson how many different grills have you had sex with
2015-10-15 23:38:44	indeedwatson	you might be gayt
2015-10-15 23:38:46	indeedwatson	gay
2015-10-15 23:38:57	indeedwatson	uh not enough to tell
2015-10-15 23:39:50	Oberbuntu	is the number >= 1?
2015-10-15 23:40:09	Oberbuntu	i'm trying very nicely to ask if you're a virgin
2015-10-15 23:42:00	indeedwatson	no
2015-10-15 23:42:11	Oberbuntu	so then what's the number
2015-10-15 23:42:25	indeedwatson	im not telling
2015-10-15 23:42:30	Oberbuntu	lmao why
2015-10-15 23:42:40	Oberbuntu	you're being a weirdo
2015-10-15 23:42:48	Oberbuntu	i'm only at 5, hardly a playboy
2015-10-15 23:44:29	indeedwatson	you don't accept me in fb but im the weirdo
2015-10-15 23:44:52	Oberbuntu	tbf you're not a real human on fb
2015-10-15 23:45:22	indeedwatson	why would you give a shit
2015-10-15 23:45:26	indeedwatson	it's a stupid site
2015-10-15 23:45:28	Oberbuntu	you're a picture of a retreiver with 50 friends
2015-10-15 23:45:40	Oberbuntu	and a pseudoname
2015-10-15 23:46:16	indeedwatson	and you're pictures of gay sex in robes
2015-10-15 23:46:42	Oberbuntu	because privacy is a two way street, the more i think about it it's weird for me to give you unwavering access to pictures of me over the past ten years and cliffnotes of all the places i've been when i don't really have any clue what you look like or what your name is
2015-10-15 23:46:59	indeedwatson	you know what i look like
2015-10-15 23:47:04	indeedwatson	an my name isn't a secret
2015-10-15 23:47:09	Oberbuntu	i might have seen you for a moment once
2015-10-15 23:47:15	Oberbuntu	but i don't even think it was a whole face
2015-10-15 23:47:38	indeedwatson	and why you care about privacy when it comes to someone you know for months but you don't care about privacy from strangers who can read your whole message history and more
2015-10-15 23:47:43	Oberbuntu	well if it's not a secret i don't know it
2015-10-15 23:47:46	indeedwatson	ive posted pics, im sure you've seen it
2015-10-15 23:48:00	Oberbuntu	js
2015-10-15 23:48:03	indeedwatson	my name's German Prida
2015-10-15 23:48:09	indeedwatson	you just don't pay attention i guess
2015-10-15 23:48:13	Oberbuntu	you're my e-brother for sure
2015-10-15 23:48:26	Oberbuntu	fair enough
2015-10-15 23:48:27	Oberbuntu	ty
2015-10-15 23:48:28	indeedwatson	i really don't get that privacy thing tho
2015-10-15 23:48:31	indeedwatson	pot does the same
2015-10-15 23:48:44	indeedwatson	doesn't want to share pics showing her face on irc
2015-10-15 23:49:08	indeedwatson	but any pic posted in fb or even saved in fb in private can be seen by some stranger
2015-10-15 23:49:11	Oberbuntu	yeah i totally didn't mean to put that picture in the main channel that day
2015-10-15 23:49:18	Oberbuntu	it was an accident with newlines
2015-10-15 23:49:28	indeedwatson	which pic
2015-10-15 23:49:30	Oberbuntu	but after that the floodgates were kinda open
2015-10-15 23:49:41	Oberbuntu	the first and only time i've put my face in irc
2015-10-15 23:49:46	Oberbuntu	you were there for sure
2015-10-15 23:50:02	indeedwatson	i mean with her i sort of get it because she doesn't know much i guess, or is naive about internet privacy
2015-10-15 23:50:39	indeedwatson	i just find it weird
2015-10-15 23:50:49	Oberbuntu	lol we're all naive about privacy in general
2015-10-15 23:50:54	Oberbuntu	no one understands the whole system
2015-10-15 23:51:01	indeedwatson	but you are tech-savvy
2015-10-15 23:51:18	Oberbuntu	i obviously understand the internet and software more than you but the hardware issues are way over my head
2015-10-15 23:51:20	indeedwatson	i mean pot maybe doesn't even know who Snowden is
2015-10-15 23:51:31	Oberbuntu	and i've succumbed to a lot of it
2015-10-15 23:51:48	Oberbuntu	i only do the stuff that takes the least effort
2015-10-15 23:51:55	Oberbuntu	privacy badger and ghostery and what not
2015-10-15 23:51:57	Oberbuntu	vpn
2015-10-15 23:52:05	indeedwatson	i don't think it's a secret or that you need to know much to know google and fb aren't private
2015-10-15 23:52:12	Oberbuntu	lol right
2015-10-15 23:52:29	Oberbuntu	but imo it's worth it to give up that privacy for the convenience
2015-10-15 23:52:38	Oberbuntu	my uncle got rid of his cell phone and computer
2015-10-15 23:52:46	Oberbuntu	insisted that i send him postal mail to talk to him
2015-10-15 23:52:55	Oberbuntu	i just stopped talking to him because it's too much work
2015-10-15 23:53:15	indeedwatson	so it's worth a random NSA dude looking at your donger whenever he wants but someone you talk to for months seeing that you were in las vegas with hookers is crossing a line?
2015-10-15 23:53:18	Oberbuntu	i have a fb chat with my two best friends that we talk in every single day all day.
2015-10-15 23:53:58	indeedwatson	yeah i use fb too for that convenience, i just don't upload my life to it
2015-10-15 23:54:05	Oberbuntu	that's worth the tradeoff for me. well yeah there needs to be a tradeoff between you and i too right?
2015-10-15 23:54:10	indeedwatson	not just cause of privacy, i just don't enjoy it
2015-10-15 23:54:32	indeedwatson	i dont like taking pics of me, i don't like writing random posts
2015-10-15 23:54:44	Oberbuntu	if you go on my facebook you'll see that almost the only things that get posted are either friends posting bjj techniques or me looking for people to go watch ufc with :P
2015-10-15 23:55:31	indeedwatson	well the downside of that is that strangers can know your hobbies and the places and times you will be
2015-10-15 23:55:47	Oberbuntu	well at least the strangers thing should be fairly minimized
2015-10-15 23:56:01	Oberbuntu	without being my friend you shouldn't be able to see much on my facebook right?
2015-10-15 23:56:16	Oberbuntu	they make it kinda hard to be sure that everything is always set to friends only
2015-10-15 23:56:24	indeedwatson	im talking about people who have access to your fb that you don't know about
2015-10-15 23:56:37	Oberbuntu	like what scraping bots?
2015-10-15 23:56:47	Oberbuntu	agency that have infiltrated fb
2015-10-15 23:57:03	indeedwatson	dunno
2015-10-15 23:57:27	Oberbuntu	shit i refuse to talk about drugs over facebook chat, i know that there is business going on
2015-10-15 23:57:35	Oberbuntu	but it's still worth the freedom
2015-10-15 23:57:37	Oberbuntu	imo
2015-10-15 23:57:45	indeedwatson	i just don't see what the worst possible scenario of me seeing that information could be, compared to people who already could have access
2015-10-15 23:58:17	Oberbuntu	my grandma posted on a picture of me with world bjj champion roberto 'cyborg' abreu and told me that we are both handsome men
2015-10-15 23:58:20	Oberbuntu	that shit is priceless
2015-10-15 23:58:27	indeedwatson	lol
2015-10-15 23:58:38	Oberbuntu	chill out nigga i added you
2015-10-15 23:58:55	indeedwatson	im chill it's just weird to me like i said
2015-10-15 23:59:12	Oberbuntu	and i actually do recognize your mug
2015-10-15 23:59:15	Oberbuntu	i must have seen it once
2015-10-15 23:59:19	Oberbuntu	-_-
2015-10-15 23:59:31	indeedwatson	im not mad or anything, and the main reason is cause you're so bipolar with irc nicks i don't know where to write you when you're offline
2015-10-15 23:59:49	indeedwatson	i told you, you don't pay attention
2015-10-15 23:59:55	indeedwatson	and those pictures are very old
2015-10-16 00:00:01	indeedwatson	and not taken by me
2015-10-16 00:00:22	Oberbuntu	well now you can write me on fb
2015-10-16 00:00:31	Oberbuntu	i have fb messaging on 24/7
2015-10-16 00:00:57	Oberbuntu	if you can't get a hold of me their i'm either legitimately indisposed or am ignoring you for reals :P
2015-10-16 00:01:04	Oberbuntu	there*
2015-10-16 00:02:00	Oberbuntu	i agree with you about taking pictures though
2015-10-16 00:02:11	Oberbuntu	i really do wish someone would force me to take a picture :P
2015-10-16 00:02:23	indeedwatson	if im out i fb scarcely cause i don't have the app, only the slow ass browser
2015-10-16 00:02:26	Oberbuntu	besides my bjj pictures i don't have anything remotely recent or satisfying
2015-10-16 00:02:44	indeedwatson	none of my irl friends are picture people either
2015-10-16 00:03:11	indeedwatson	those pics on fb where with a group of people i don't see anymore
2015-10-16 00:03:58	Oberbuntu	ah
2015-10-16 00:04:36	indeedwatson	my friends only take pictures of memes
2015-10-16 00:04:36	Oberbuntu	#bwf irc attracts some weirdos
2015-10-16 00:04:40	Oberbuntu	you and i not exempt
2015-10-16 00:04:55	indeedwatson	i added rhine recently cause im curious
2015-10-16 00:05:12	Oberbuntu	curious about what
2015-10-16 00:05:20	Oberbuntu	she's probably a legit insane person
2015-10-16 00:05:40	indeedwatson	why she insists on referring to herself as a dude
2015-10-16 00:05:51	Oberbuntu	she likes the game and the attention
2015-10-16 00:06:05	indeedwatson	but she was quiet for a long time
2015-10-16 00:06:09	indeedwatson	liek rudantu
2015-10-16 00:06:29	indeedwatson	im not sure if you were here back then but he was quiet and normal
2015-10-16 00:06:36	indeedwatson	and suddenly he became a memelord
2015-10-16 00:07:17	Oberbuntu	rudantu is super next level
2015-10-16 00:07:35	Oberbuntu	how long have you been coming to this chat? longer than me i think right?
