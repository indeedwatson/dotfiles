2015-10-01 10:19:27	JacolynDandreano	so it sounds like an easy win
2015-10-01 10:19:36	yama	is it? what if she wrote it for another reason

2015-10-01 10:47:10	yama	i want to know if it's actually good or everyone's raving about it just cause of the movie
2015-10-01 10:47:30	yama	and i want to be able to possibly say "the book was better"
2015-10-01 10:47:36	JacolynDandreano	never heard of it
2015-10-01 10:47:43	JacolynDandreano	the book is always better
2015-10-01 10:47:58	JacolynDandreano	i have never seen a movie that was better than the book as far as i recall

2015-10-01 14:29:07	yama	plus you'll probably find the guy attractive
2015-10-01 14:29:14	yama	or maybe not cause he lacks his left arm lol

2015-10-07 22:37:05	JacolynDandreano	Tho if we had waited to read the article til tomorrow we would have been REALLY shocked
2015-10-07 22:37:20	JacolynDandreano	But I had no idea it would happen so soon
2015-10-07 22:37:38	JacolynDandreano	No no it is nice to read related articles
2015-10-07 22:38:02	JacolynDandreano	when I finish the book, I want to read one or two articles analyzing the judge

2015-10-07 22:40:40	JacolynDandreano	Not really. I probably will be when it actually happens. But some ppl are starting to be more absent and also occasionally rude so I'm not jealous now
2015-10-07 22:40:58	JacolynDandreano	most of my favorite ppl aren't going anyway :P

2015-10-07 22:48:09	JacolynDandreano	Why
2015-10-07 22:48:35	JacolynDandreano	No, sod isn't. And there is another in ur original who isnt
2015-10-07 22:49:08	JacolynDandreano	Also I like the ones who are most helpful and who are still friendly to me. In addition to being friends
2015-10-07 22:49:37	JacolynDandreano	I don't really talk much with Antranik compared to the other mods. As much as I heart him
2015-10-07 22:49:42	JacolynDandreano	He can be sixth
2015-10-07 22:49:51	JacolynDandreano	What
2015-10-07 22:49:55	JacolynDandreano	see now ur judging
2015-10-07 22:50:03	JacolynDandreano	and I feel bad even saying it
2015-10-07 22:50:42	JacolynDandreano	I like u. Is that weird?
2015-10-07 22:51:29	JacolynDandreano	No. And I don't think the others are either
2015-10-07 22:51:36	JacolynDandreano	for the most part
2015-10-07 22:51:47	JacolynDandreano	I picked ppl I'm friends with
2015-10-07 22:52:04	JacolynDandreano	tho I am not sure if sod even counts because he ignores me
2015-10-07 22:52:16	JacolynDandreano	Kaye wasn't even there
2015-10-07 22:52:27	JacolynDandreano	Anyway I don't want to talk about this
2015-10-07 22:52:43	JacolynDandreano	i feel bad saying it because I DO like Antranik and kayr
2015-10-07 22:52:46	JacolynDandreano	kaye
2015-10-07 22:53:50	JacolynDandreano	If it makes u feel better I was originally starting to list my favs and u were the first person I thought of
2015-10-07 22:54:34	JacolynDandreano	I like Antranik a lot. He is super nice and helpful and awesome. But he has occasionally made comments that made me feel bad so he is a close sixth
2015-10-07 22:54:41	JacolynDandreano	Along with kaye
2015-10-07 22:55:26	JacolynDandreano	Don't be silly Germán. There's a reason why you're the only person I'm talking to
2015-10-07 22:55:56	JacolynDandreano	Lol phi is funny. And he doesn't mean it like that. And I've accepted it
2015-10-07 22:56:07	JacolynDandreano	But yes
2015-10-07 22:56:27	JacolynDandreano	not worse as in meaner but worse as in "made me feel worse"

2015-10-10 22:25:39	JacolynDandreano	and can't move

2015-10-12 18:58:06	JacolynDandreano	Are you here
2015-10-12 19:08:03	yama	hello
2015-10-12 19:08:03	--	[JacolynDandreano] is away: Offline
2015-10-12 19:08:07	yama	whats up
2015-10-12 19:08:22	JacolynDandreano	I finished the book. Did you
2015-10-12 19:12:03	JacolynDandreano	Are you at work? Why are you not responding :(
2015-10-12 19:12:26	JacolynDandreano	I finished the book and I need to talk about it. It is so weird and disturbing
2015-10-12 19:12:30	JacolynDandreano	And dark
2015-10-12 19:21:26	yama	yes just now
2015-10-12 19:21:33	yama	wtf was the epilogue
2015-10-12 19:21:51	JacolynDandreano	I don't know what any of it was
2015-10-12 19:22:03	yama	haha
2015-10-12 19:22:05	JacolynDandreano	Maybe something to do with trains?
2015-10-12 19:22:09	JacolynDandreano	I dunno
2015-10-12 19:22:22	yama	I'm kinda sad it's over
2015-10-12 19:22:29	JacolynDandreano	It made me sad that he shot the kid. I expected it
2015-10-12 19:22:52	JacolynDandreano	but still he didn't have to detail how the little brother was all alone and how sad he looked afterward
2015-10-12 19:23:34	yama	that bit was weird too
2015-10-12 19:24:12	JacolynDandreano	The whole ending was weird
2015-10-12 19:24:53	JacolynDandreano	so does the judge represent unbridled violence? Or death? Or what
2015-10-12 19:25:56	yama	nah i don't think it's like that
2015-10-12 19:26:27	yama	I feel him being a representation of one thing would be too simple
2015-10-12 19:26:34	yama	too fable-like
2015-10-12 19:27:02	JacolynDandreano	Yeah but why is he the only one left dancing
2015-10-12 19:27:12	JacolynDandreano	forever and always
2015-10-12 19:27:36	JacolynDandreano	He must symbolize something. Even if not entirely
2015-10-12 19:30:06	yama	i guess i should read some articles about it

2015-10-12 19:31:14	yama	I'm trying to decide whether to read another book by him already or take a break
2015-10-12 19:31:48	yama	I'm also confused as to why he got so antagonistic towards the kid after the massacre
2015-10-12 19:33:39	yama	btw the kindle has a built in dictionary/translator that's pretty neat
2015-10-12 19:34:32	yama	apparently there's a theory that at the end the judge buttfucks the kid
2015-10-12 19:34:33	yama	lol
2015-10-12 19:37:01	JacolynDandreano	Yeah I like the dictionary. And I think you can choose which one it uses
2015-10-12 19:37:13	JacolynDandreano	That's what I thought happened watts
2015-10-12 19:37:28	JacolynDandreano	because of the way he grabbed him
2015-10-12 19:37:43	JacolynDandreano	But at the very least he must have killed him....
2015-10-12 19:38:18	JacolynDandreano	I'm gonna go back to reading the count more consistently. I'm 38% done with it. Haha
2015-10-12 19:39:08	JacolynDandreano	But I want to find another classic to read with you. But it needs to be on my 1001 books list. Unless you don't want to because I'm too slow or boring to talk to
2015-10-12 19:39:19	JacolynDandreano	Which I'm ok with
2015-10-12 19:40:59	yama	yeah you're so boring to talk to that's why i'm talking to you right now
2015-10-12 19:41:03	yama	show me the list
2015-10-12 19:49:41	JacolynDandreano	Haha I basically begged you to go on fb to talk to me
2015-10-12 19:49:46	JacolynDandreano	ill show you tomorrow
2015-10-12 19:49:50	JacolynDandreano	If I can
2015-10-12 19:50:08	JacolynDandreano	I gotta go in a minute
2015-10-12 19:55:45	yama	:(
2015-10-12 19:55:52	yama	where are you going
2015-10-12 19:55:58	yama	you will miss my pizza
2015-10-12 19:56:03	JacolynDandreano	Hanging out with some friends
2015-10-12 19:56:06	JacolynDandreano	post it here
2015-10-12 19:56:45	JacolynDandreano	Ugh I wish I could talk more about the book but I'm at such a loss to try to analyze it
2015-10-12 19:57:54	JacolynDandreano	I sense that there must be a meaning tied in with the judge, particularly since there was so much philosophy inserted around his character
2015-10-12 19:58:14	yama	that's why i wanna read about it and why i'll probably read it again in the future
2015-10-12 19:58:26	JacolynDandreano	But I feel like i would need to read a bunch of articles and then reread a bunch to get it at all
2015-10-12 19:58:29	yama	that kinda stuff won't happen with The Martian probably lol
2015-10-12 19:58:38	JacolynDandreano	Lol
2015-10-12 19:58:55	yama	i should stop reading it
2015-10-12 19:59:07	yama	it's like BM was my "main" currently reading thing and the martian secondary
2015-10-12 19:59:47	JacolynDandreano	Yeah not many books are this dense. It is funny that the plot itself is so...Uneventful?.... But every other aspect is so rich
2015-10-12 19:59:57	JacolynDandreano	With detail
2015-10-12 19:59:57	JacolynDandreano	With detail
2015-10-12 20:00:46	JacolynDandreano	and the language/style, my god, is just superior to anything else I've read
2015-10-12 20:00:47	yama	that's the thing with a lot of art, if it's vague it leads to more interpretation 
2015-10-12 20:01:32	JacolynDandreano	I like ambiguity better than vagueness, but yeah the best books create questions I guess
2015-10-12 20:02:09	yama	it's gotta feel like it's vague but that there is some meaning that we're not aware of, almost like if the meaning is beyond the author himself
2015-10-12 20:02:29	yama	like he didn't just make it up, he was just a door
2015-10-12 20:02:42	yama	i feel that way about some movies and even some games
2015-10-12 20:03:12	yama	i'd say the judge is ambiguous, but the character of the kid is pretty vague
2015-10-13 11:57:58	JacolynDandreano	ok i thought it was. but then i was thinking that maybe you did actually want to read it
2015-10-13 11:57:58	JacolynDandreano	ok i thought it was. but then i was thinking that maybe you did actually want to read it
2015-10-13 11:58:03	JacolynDandreano	:)
2015-10-13 11:58:07	JacolynDandreano	so what is your pick?
2015-10-13 12:00:16	yama	im not sure, I'd add The Idiot to the list I said because it was mostly Sci Fi
2015-10-13 12:00:16	--	[JacolynDandreano] is away: Offline
2015-10-13 12:01:04	yama	I'd also like to read some Tolstoi but Anna Karenina and War and Peace are very long iirc
2015-10-13 12:01:33	JacolynDandreano	ugh don't give me a list. pick the book you're most interested in.... I'm up for anything. as long as i can get a copy of it
2015-10-13 12:01:54	yama	wow i feel like a dictator
2015-10-13 12:02:18	yama	ok Neuromancer
2015-10-13 12:22:40	yama	did u die
2015-10-13 12:27:44	JacolynDandreano	yes
2015-10-13 12:27:48	JacolynDandreano	also my boss was talking to me
2015-10-13 12:27:58	JacolynDandreano	let me see if i can get neuromancer
2015-10-13 12:29:01	yama	if you don't want to read it you can totally say the Neuromancer section of the library burned down
2015-10-13 12:34:57	yama	thanks for the mental image
2015-10-13 13:36:35	JacolynDandreano	i can get neuromancer. should i request it?
2015-10-13 13:40:21	yama	yes
2015-10-13 13:40:39	JacolynDandreano	ok. yay! do you think i will be completely lost when i read it? lol
2015-10-13 13:40:59	yama	idk, i haven't read it
2015-10-13 13:41:15	yama	all i know it's that it's a classic of scifi and cyberpunk
2015-10-13 13:41:29	yama	i don't think you'd be lost, i don't imagine it's harder to read than BM
2015-10-13 13:42:25	JacolynDandreano	true :D
2015-10-13 13:42:28	JacolynDandreano	ok ill order it
2015-10-14 21:22:27	JacolynDandreano	That's better :)
2015-10-15 21:49:28	JacolynDandreano	I was irc-ing because I was doing h2t
2015-10-15 21:49:42	JacolynDandreano	i also did Antranik's yoga video
2015-10-15 21:49:48	JacolynDandreano	Now I'm reading
2015-10-15 21:50:01	yama	did you like the yoga
2015-10-15 21:50:01	--	[JacolynDandreano] is away: Offline
2015-10-15 21:50:04	JacolynDandreano	I never read Lolita. Did you?
2015-10-15 21:50:09	yama	yes
2015-10-15 21:50:18	JacolynDandreano	yeah it felt really really good
2015-10-15 21:50:25	JacolynDandreano	was nice stretching
2015-10-15 21:50:44	yama	i liked it except the downward doges
2015-10-15 21:50:56	yama	im talking about yoga no Lolita
2015-10-15 21:51:32	JacolynDandreano	I didn't think there were downward doges in lolita
2015-10-15 21:51:32	JacolynDandreano	I didn't think there were downward doges in lolita
2015-10-15 21:51:32	JacolynDandreano	I didn't think there were downward doges in lolita
2015-10-15 21:51:38	JacolynDandreano	tho maybe other positions
2015-10-15 21:51:41	JacolynDandreano	eh eh?
2015-10-15 21:51:48	yama	well not explicit
2015-10-15 21:52:13	JacolynDandreano	Oh. I heard it is about some old man's affair with a little girl
2015-10-15 21:52:24	JacolynDandreano	And I heard it is disturbing
2015-10-15 21:52:26	yama	ye
2015-10-15 21:52:28	JacolynDandreano	And strange
2015-10-15 21:52:35	JacolynDandreano	Did you like it
2015-10-15 21:52:35	yama	in a way it's kinda like BM
2015-10-15 21:52:43	yama	i mean in a very farfetched way
2015-10-15 21:53:01	yama	because it's told by him and it's kinda poetic at times, and uses elaborate words
2015-10-15 21:53:07	JacolynDandreano	It draws you in but you feel disturbed reading it?
2015-10-15 21:53:09	yama	i really like the opening, let me quote it
2015-10-15 21:53:16	JacolynDandreano	Oh I see
2015-10-15 21:53:36	JacolynDandreano	Should I talk to you or should i read :P
2015-10-15 21:53:56	yama	“Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta. She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four feet ten in one sock. She was Lola in slacks. She was Dolly at school. She was Dolores on the dotted line. But in my arms she was always Lolita."
2015-10-15 21:53:58	JacolynDandreano	I'm only 7 pages in and a bit confused about this world and the characters
2015-10-15 21:54:07	yama	fine, read u.u
2015-10-15 21:54:19	JacolynDandreano	I'm reading this quote
2015-10-15 21:54:21	JacolynDandreano	don't leave
2015-10-15 21:55:08	yama	i can't say it's that's disturbing cause it's told from his pov and he's an unreliable narrator and sort of makes excuses
2015-10-15 21:55:13	JacolynDandreano	Yes I see what you mean by the melody of the prose
2015-10-15 21:55:23	«	JacolynDandreano (100000303216174@facebook) has quit (localhost.localdomain gmail.com)
2015-10-15 21:55:29	»	JacolynDandreano (100000303216174@facebook) is back on server
2015-10-15 21:55:34	JacolynDandreano	Oh unreliable narrators! I love those
2015-10-15 21:55:48	yama	i read it because it appeared A LOT in top novels of all time
2015-10-15 21:55:55	yama	and because of that it disappointed me a bit
2015-10-15 21:56:02	JacolynDandreano	I like a tricky complex narrator
2015-10-15 21:56:15	yama	but i might like it more upon a 2nd read
2015-10-15 21:56:22	yama	and you probably should read it
2015-10-15 21:58:26	JacolynDandreano	One book at a time ;) tho I wouldn't mind reading it with u in the future if you're up for it
2015-10-15 21:58:39	JacolynDandreano	It IS on my reading list I think
2015-10-15 21:58:59	JacolynDandreano	How far are you in neuromancer
2015-10-15 21:59:05	yama	there's 1000 books in your list if it isn't there you should burn that list
2015-10-15 21:59:10	yama	chapter 3
2015-10-15 21:59:13	yama	i didn't read anymore
2015-10-15 21:59:18	yama	cause SOMEONE told me not to
2015-10-15 21:59:25	JacolynDandreano	Good :P
2015-10-15 21:59:36	JacolynDandreano	❤️
2015-10-15 21:59:43	JacolynDandreano	You can now tho
2015-10-15 21:59:54	JacolynDandreano	because what if I fly past you tonight
2015-10-15 22:00:07	yama	i will look up at the sky and wave
2015-10-15 22:00:19	JacolynDandreano	:D you're funny
2015-10-15 22:00:36	yama	you're right, since i dont work until next week i wont read that much
2015-10-15 22:00:45	yama	plust im reading articles and essays on the kindle too
2015-10-15 22:00:52	yama	you should get one :D
2015-10-15 22:00:58	JacolynDandreano	So did u find the world confusing too at the beginning?
2015-10-15 22:01:04	yama	yes
2015-10-15 22:01:07	JacolynDandreano	i have my kindle fire
2015-10-15 22:01:13	yama	that's just a tablet
2015-10-15 22:01:19	JacolynDandreano	What essays are you reading
2015-10-15 22:01:33	JacolynDandreano	it is a tablet that I can read kindle stuff on
2015-10-15 22:01:51	yama	the world is a bit confusing and sometimes a bit cheesy, but that's because it was a huge pioneer in things cyberpunk 
2015-10-15 22:01:52	JacolynDandreano	prob the main difference is just mine is worse on eyes
2015-10-15 22:01:58	yama	i can read kindle stuff on my phone
2015-10-15 22:02:10	yama	a kindle fire is closer to a normal phone than to an ebook
2015-10-15 22:02:15	JacolynDandreano	:( shutup you
2015-10-15 22:02:37	JacolynDandreano	I like it
2015-10-15 22:02:42	JacolynDandreano	doesnt bother me
2015-10-15 22:02:47	yama	it's a normal tablet
2015-10-15 22:02:54	yama	do you not prefer the look of real pages?
2015-10-15 22:03:00	yama	cause that's what the paperwhite looks like
2015-10-15 22:03:35	JacolynDandreano	Meh I prefer turning real pages
2015-10-15 22:04:11	yama	@slap
2015-10-15 22:04:33	yama	i thought you said you didn't even see one irl
2015-10-15 22:04:43	JacolynDandreano	I haven't
2015-10-15 22:04:47	JacolynDandreano	so
2015-10-15 22:04:58	yama	...
2015-10-15 22:05:16	JacolynDandreano	shhh
2015-10-15 22:05:48	JacolynDandreano	I'm cold and I'm bundled in two thick comforters
2015-10-15 22:06:17	yama	get a third one
2015-10-15 22:06:19	yama	or a doge
2015-10-15 22:06:58	JacolynDandreano	I need both. I'm lying on a third one actually but I don't want to move to get under it
2015-10-15 22:08:50	JacolynDandreano	Did you leave
2015-10-15 22:08:51	yama	i thikn i need a new pillow
2015-10-15 22:08:59	yama	no i was yelling at oberino
2015-10-15 22:08:59	JacolynDandreano	Why
2015-10-15 22:09:08	JacolynDandreano	And why
2015-10-15 22:09:30	yama	because i have one that feels too thin and another one that feels too thick
2015-10-15 22:09:48	yama	and because he has this girl who wants to meet up but he keeps beating around the bush
2015-10-15 22:10:10	JacolynDandreano	Oh I already yelled at him for that
2015-10-15 22:10:19	JacolynDandreano	he apparently ignored me
2015-10-15 22:11:22	yama	:/
2015-10-15 22:11:39	yama	today's train ride was weird
2015-10-15 22:11:53	JacolynDandreano	How so
2015-10-15 22:12:23	yama	first two guys almost get into a fight
2015-10-15 22:12:42	yama	then a guy said something with a girl and she was all like WHAT DID YOU SAY, SAY THAT AGAIN IDIOT
2015-10-15 22:12:46	yama	which was hot
2015-10-15 22:12:59	yama	and then a guy tried to steal a purse and get off the train in movement
2015-10-15 22:13:08	JacolynDandreano	How is that hot? Lol
2015-10-15 22:13:13	yama	but luckily the girl kep the purse
2015-10-15 22:13:23	JacolynDandreano	Do things like this normally happen
2015-10-15 22:13:29	yama	well, she was hot, and it was nice that she spoke out
2015-10-15 22:13:30	yama	no
2015-10-15 22:13:47	JacolynDandreano	Ah it was hot because she was hot
2015-10-15 22:13:55	JacolynDandreano	step 1 and step 2
2015-10-15 22:14:33	yama	well that made her hotter
2015-10-15 22:14:49	JacolynDandreano	interesting
2015-10-15 22:15:06	yama	but see, that's why i don't talk to women on the train :)
2015-10-15 22:15:32	JacolynDandreano	Because they'll yell at you?
2015-10-15 22:15:48	yama	because i don't think they'd like it
2015-10-15 22:16:13	JacolynDandreano	Depends on what you say
2015-10-15 22:16:33	yama	i almost said something to the girl with the purse
2015-10-15 22:16:42	JacolynDandreano	Best case is to start up a convo with a girl who is reading
2015-10-15 22:16:52	yama	cause yesterday's trip she was standing next to me, and she gets off on the same station
2015-10-15 22:16:55	JacolynDandreano	bwcause common interests
2015-10-15 22:17:06	yama	usually it's old women reading 
2015-10-15 22:17:11	yama	and girls are texting
2015-10-15 22:18:19	JacolynDandreano	Well those girls aren't worth your time. If I took a train, i would always be reading
2015-10-15 22:18:50	yama	what if they're reading 50 shades of grey
2015-10-15 22:19:00	JacolynDandreano	-.-
2015-10-15 22:19:11	JacolynDandreano	I don't count that as reading
2015-10-15 22:19:19	JacolynDandreano	also I skimmed the series fyi
2015-10-15 22:19:27	yama	woa
2015-10-15 22:19:32	JacolynDandreano	before I knew what it was about
2015-10-15 22:19:39	JacolynDandreano	And how crappy it was
2015-10-15 22:19:42	yama	i guess every girl is into that ;)
2015-10-15 22:20:03	JacolynDandreano	i just knew it was a best seller so I wanted to see what the buzz was about
2015-10-15 22:20:11	yama	suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure
2015-10-15 22:20:20	JacolynDandreano	Yes it is true
2015-10-15 22:20:37	JacolynDandreano	and I can confirm it was the worst book I ever read
2015-10-15 22:20:50	JacolynDandreano	in terms of sounding like a 5 year old wrote it
2015-10-15 22:21:24	JacolynDandreano	It literally sounded like it was written for an audience of preteens. Except for the content obv
2015-10-15 22:26:26	JacolynDandreano	guess I'll go read
2015-10-15 22:26:44	yama	sorry i was watching the talk
2015-10-15 22:26:59	yama	oberon insist that i make a tinder
2015-10-15 22:27:06	JacolynDandreano	Ok that's fine. I should read anyway
2015-10-15 22:27:15	yama	but yes go read, i am boring compared to the book
2015-10-15 22:27:49	JacolynDandreano	Not at all. I just don't want to interrupt what you are doing by saying stupid things :)
2015-10-15 22:28:11	JacolynDandreano	Also I think tinder is shallow and stupid, but whatever you want
2015-10-15 22:28:27	yama	i like when you interrupt me
2015-10-15 22:29:08	yama	his point was that because girls are force to give a like/dislike based on appearance, if a girl does like me that takes pressure off cause i know she finds me attractive
2015-10-15 22:29:28	JacolynDandreano	I suppose
2015-10-15 22:29:38	JacolynDandreano	so try it for a week
2015-10-15 22:29:40	JacolynDandreano	I guess
2015-10-15 22:30:26	yama	haha i like how you're so reluctant 
2015-10-15 22:30:33	yama	almost more than me
2015-10-15 22:30:38	JacolynDandreano	:)
2015-10-15 22:31:05	JacolynDandreano	yes I am
2015-10-15 22:32:38	yama	why
2015-10-15 22:32:54	JacolynDandreano	Because tinder is shallow
2015-10-15 22:33:29	yama	my lesbian friend found some decent dates with it
2015-10-15 22:33:53	JacolynDandreano	I'm not saying it won't get you dates

2015-10-15 22:50:01	yama	unless you wanna date them
2015-10-15 22:50:11	JacolynDandreano	It would still annoy you

2015-10-15 22:52:33	yama	did i tell you i liked how the pizza dough turned out
2015-10-15 22:52:38	yama	and i tried the broiler
2015-10-15 22:53:08	JacolynDandreano	Oh good! Pics?
2015-10-15 22:53:18	yama	none, sorry
2015-10-15 22:53:24	yama	i don't usually have my phone in the kitchen
2015-10-15 22:53:30	JacolynDandreano	:'(
2015-10-15 22:53:34	yama	and then i just eat it
2015-10-15 22:53:43	yama	cause im hungry and it gets cold
2015-10-15 22:53:51	yama	and looks like it wants to be in my mouth

2015-10-15 22:54:41	yama	i still have 2 doughs left
2015-10-15 22:55:11	yama	separating the 1kg into 4 doughs from the start and putting them in plastic bags was a good idea btw
2015-10-15 22:55:17	JacolynDandreano	remind me what was diff about this one
2015-10-15 22:55:56	yama	i made it and put the whole flour and water with correct measurements from the start, and then just mixed and kneaded
2015-10-15 22:56:10	yama	whereas usually i "eye" it and add flour/water as i go along
2015-10-15 22:56:29	yama	but it turned out very smooth and very moist but not super sticky
2015-10-15 22:56:42	yama	then i cut it in 4 and put it in bags in the fridge
2015-10-15 22:56:50	JacolynDandreano	Ah yes

2015-10-16 20:44:55	JacolynDandreano	Because you left?
2015-10-17 21:29:37	JacolynDandreano	What are you up to in neuro
2015-10-17 21:30:44	yama	i haven't read anymore, i was with friends
2015-10-17 21:30:44	--	[JacolynDandreano] is away: Offline
2015-10-17 21:30:47	yama	you?
2015-10-17 21:31:20	JacolynDandreano	Just started chapter 4 last night. A few pages in...
2015-10-17 21:31:32	yama	are you liking it?
2015-10-17 21:31:33	JacolynDandreano	I'll read more tonight tho
2015-10-17 21:31:37	JacolynDandreano	yes!
2015-10-17 21:31:45	yama	good :)
2015-10-17 21:31:52	JacolynDandreano	but I find the technical jargon a bit confusing
2015-10-17 21:32:08	JacolynDandreano	Like trying to figure out what simstim is.
2015-10-17 21:32:11	yama	afaik most of it is just made up
2015-10-17 21:32:22	JacolynDandreano	i guessed it was simulated stimulator
2015-10-17 21:32:26	JacolynDandreano	or something
2015-10-17 21:32:49	yama	yeah that's made up for the book
2015-10-17 21:32:53	JacolynDandreano	Ok I wasn't sure if he made up those terms or if it is just terms nerds know
2015-10-17 21:33:10	JacolynDandreano	i thought maybe you knew all of that stuff ;)
2015-10-17 21:33:24	yama	lol nah, it's really fucking old
2015-10-17 21:34:01	yama	so he was imagining a future world and had to make up stuff
2015-10-17 21:34:10	JacolynDandreano	Ok good
2015-10-17 21:34:17	yama	afaik you're supposed to fill in the gaps with imagination and clues 
2015-10-17 21:34:19	JacolynDandreano	so that's what makes me read slower
2015-10-17 21:34:28	JacolynDandreano	but the plot itself is very interesting
2015-10-17 21:34:36	yama	i like that as opposed to having everything explained in forced dialog
2015-10-17 21:35:33	JacolynDandreano	Me too. When authors try to explain with dialog it can be really boring
2015-10-17 21:35:57	yama	i can't not imagine the girl as Trinity 
2015-10-17 21:36:30	JacolynDandreano	I'm only slightly imagining her as trinity
2015-10-17 21:36:35	JacolynDandreano	just the body I think
2015-10-17 21:36:44	JacolynDandreano	But maybe shorter
2015-10-17 21:36:56	JacolynDandreano	With slightly bigger boobs
2015-10-17 21:37:01	yama	hah
2015-10-17 21:37:08	JacolynDandreano	but thin and boyish I guess
2015-10-17 21:37:16	yama	i don't think i went into that much detail in my imagination
2015-10-17 21:37:44	JacolynDandreano	I can't help but base her on trinity tho. Trinity with weird ass sunglasses
2015-10-17 21:38:04	JacolynDandreano	but case in my mind is more bulky muscular than neo
2015-10-17 21:38:26	yama	the watchowskis probably had this girl in mind when they made trinity
2015-10-17 21:38:30	yama	i can't recall her name
2015-10-17 21:38:31	yama	mindy?
2015-10-17 21:38:39	JacolynDandreano	Molly
2015-10-17 21:38:42	JacolynDandreano	like the drug
2015-10-17 21:38:48	JacolynDandreano	How can you forget
2015-10-17 21:38:53	yama	oh yeah

2015-10-23 15:36:36	yama	lots of drama last night
2015-10-23 15:36:36	JacolynDandreano	yeah
2015-10-23 15:36:44	JacolynDandreano	what happened last night
2015-10-23 15:36:53	yama	no, i was doing stupid linux stuff during the morning and then i had lunch
2015-10-23 15:36:53	JacolynDandreano	tell me the whole thing
2015-10-23 15:37:14	JacolynDandreano	was it about me at all
2015-10-23 15:37:20	yama	first cummisar complained about m092 being a dick and that he was driving him away from the community
2015-10-23 15:37:21	JacolynDandreano	did anyone mention me
2015-10-23 15:37:28	JacolynDandreano	ok go on
2015-10-23 15:37:32	yama	yes, but wait
2015-10-23 15:37:41	yama	then later, unrelated
2015-10-23 15:37:44	yama	foxlet came in
2015-10-23 15:37:49	yama	and said hi
2015-10-23 15:38:07	yama	and right away _688 called him a furry and started insulting him
2015-10-23 15:38:15	yama	and foxlet kicked him
2015-10-23 15:38:19	JacolynDandreano	lol
2015-10-23 15:38:27	yama	and _668 started whining about op abuse
2015-10-23 15:38:41	yama	and then somehow m09 made 668 op and he kicked foxlet
2015-10-23 15:39:03	yama	and later foxlet returned and said he wasn't gonna come back to the channel because of the ops
2015-10-23 15:39:33	yama	i have screenshots if you wanna read
2015-10-23 15:39:40	JacolynDandreano	yeah sure
2015-10-23 15:39:46	JacolynDandreano	im interested
2015-10-23 15:39:56	JacolynDandreano	whatever you've got
2015-10-23 15:40:01	yama	http://imgur.com/a/PQAn2
2015-10-23 15:40:28	yama	i talked to antranik later and he said he'd try to do something and see if solfire agrees or if he even cares
2015-10-23 15:40:41	yama	and then antranik said how wonderful you are :p
2015-10-23 15:44:16	yama	i feel bad for foxlet
2015-10-23 15:46:24	JacolynDandreano	i read all that. so now tell me when and why i was mentioned
2015-10-23 15:46:31	JacolynDandreano	please
2015-10-23 15:46:37	yama	i just said
2015-10-23 15:46:49	yama	i think i mentioned you in my pm with antranik
2015-10-23 15:47:05	yama	and he said you're great and how the channel wouldn't be the same without you
2015-10-23 15:47:17	JacolynDandreano	why did you mention me
2015-10-23 15:47:25	JacolynDandreano	tell me the whole conversation
2015-10-23 15:47:36	JacolynDandreano	you pm'ed antranik screenshots b/c of this, I'm guessing
2015-10-23 15:47:43	JacolynDandreano	and then how did i get brought up
2015-10-23 15:49:12	yama	sec
2015-10-23 15:49:20	yama	actually i shouldn't tell you
2015-10-23 15:49:30	yama	cause you never tell me anything about what you talk to other people
2015-10-23 15:49:38	yama	but just cause im nice
2015-10-23 15:49:43	yama	and for this time only
2015-10-23 15:50:47	JacolynDandreano	i already told you that no one says anything about you
2015-10-23 15:50:56	JacolynDandreano	there is nothing to say therefore
2015-10-23 15:52:33	yama	so you're saying no one cares about me ;)
2015-10-23 15:52:45	yama	http://imgur.com/a/1ffTb
2015-10-23 15:52:49	JacolynDandreano	I'm saying no one says anything bad
2015-10-23 15:53:59	JacolynDandreano	that's it
2015-10-23 15:54:01	JacolynDandreano	?
2015-10-23 15:54:32	yama	ye
2015-10-23 15:54:51	JacolynDandreano	wow. I'm having a horrible day and that actually made me feel a little better
2015-10-23 15:55:04	JacolynDandreano	thank you for saying nice things and sharing it with me
2015-10-23 15:55:19	JacolynDandreano	unless that never happened and you pulled a marcus bondi and doctored it
2015-10-23 15:55:33	yama	see now you have no choice but to believe it cause it was a private convo with someone else, and i wouldn't have showed you unless you asked
2015-10-23 15:55:56	yama	it took me 20mins to figure out how to screenshot, you think im gonna spend like an hour editing it? :p
2015-10-23 15:55:57	JacolynDandreano	:) thank you
2015-10-23 15:57:07	yama	;]
2015-10-23 15:57:20	JacolynDandreano	i got so mad at alex last night. and i didn't even know that was happening. lol. i was just really mad at alex and then cummisar started PMing me on fb right when i was mad and then antranik was talking to me about cummisar/alex/me
2015-10-23 15:57:33	JacolynDandreano	anyway i was mad at alex all night and i still am.
2015-10-23 15:57:38	yama	what else did he do
2015-10-23 15:57:59	JacolynDandreano	and i had no idea he did that to foxlet otherwise i would have yelled at him
2015-10-23 15:58:50	yama	i can't imagine you yelling :p
2015-10-23 15:59:26	JacolynDandreano	i would. i spent all night thinking of what i wanted to say to him
2015-10-23 15:59:37	JacolynDandreano	he didn't even do anything that bad. he was just abrupt with me
2015-10-23 15:59:39	JacolynDandreano	lol
2015-10-23 15:59:44	yama	how?
2015-10-23 16:00:36	yama	it's your turn to tell me all
2015-10-23 16:02:51	JacolynDandreano	i messaged the mods last night to ask a question about doing jefferson curls and my shoulder. threw in a joke or two... very pleasant.  the only reason why i messaged them on the sub was b/c i couldn't get on irc and i wanted to ask them the question, not the sub b/c it could be seen as slightly medical related and b/c i don't trust random people's opinions.  i thought about messaging them all on fb but i figured since it
2015-10-23 16:02:51	JacolynDandreano	was sub-related, it was best to just do it on the sub. anyway, he was just curt and told me to post it on the sub. so i politely replied and told him he didn't need to be so rude. and then he responded. and that's that. i got my answer from antranik and kayetech messaging me on fb. kayetech said alex was right but that he didn't need to be so rude
2015-10-23 16:03:19	JacolynDandreano	so you see, the whole thing was stupid for me to get mad at, but i did nothing to deserve an abrupt reply.
2015-10-23 16:03:38	JacolynDandreano	I've always defended him to other people. well i always defend everyone to other people lol. so it made me mad
2015-10-23 16:04:27	yama	yeah you're right, but i'd have expected it
2015-10-23 16:05:45	JacolynDandreano	well i didn't b/c he is generally not like that with me. when he is rude to me he at least is somewhat joking. this was just kinda assholish
2015-10-23 16:05:49	JacolynDandreano	for both responses
2015-10-23 16:06:10	yama	that's the usual treatment most of us get from them, and it's one thing people like me who know it and just speak out or ignore it, but then they behave like that to completely new people
2015-10-23 16:06:25	yama	well now you see how he truly is :p
2015-10-23 16:06:55	JacolynDandreano	no, i saw him do it to other people
2015-10-23 16:07:17	yama	and that didn't upset you?
2015-10-23 16:07:17	JacolynDandreano	like i wondered if he was rude to me yesterday b/c i told him he and other people were jealous of marcus bondi
2015-10-23 16:07:17	JacolynDandreano	like i wondered if he was rude to me yesterday b/c i told him he and other people were jealous of marcus bondi
2015-10-23 16:07:23	JacolynDandreano	and that i like bondi
2015-10-23 16:07:58	yama	i think i get more upset when they're dicks to new people or to someone like foxlet, than when they're dicks to me
2015-10-23 16:08:09	JacolynDandreano	honestly watts? i told him recently that he and some other people are acting like they're in a click and making some of the other guys feel bad.
2015-10-23 16:08:20	JacolynDandreano	and he said he didn't see it and i told him ill point it out next time i see it
2015-10-23 16:08:47	JacolynDandreano	anyway it does make me mad when he is a dick to people. i make comments here and there
2015-10-23 16:08:47	JacolynDandreano	anyway it does make me mad when he is a dick to people. i make comments here and there
2015-10-23 16:08:47	JacolynDandreano	anyway it does make me mad when he is a dick to people. i make comments here and there
2015-10-23 16:08:47	JacolynDandreano	anyway it does make me mad when he is a dick to people. i make comments here and there
2015-10-23 16:08:59	JacolynDandreano	but i also know that he is often joking too
2015-10-23 16:09:03	yama	i always thought he knew he was a total dick and just didn't care
2015-10-23 16:09:05	JacolynDandreano	so i think there is a balance
2015-10-23 16:09:19	yama	he is joking but it's never funny
2015-10-23 16:09:24	JacolynDandreano	you're probably right. but i told antranik last night that i try to think the best of people
2015-10-23 16:09:29	JacolynDandreano	and defend them
2015-10-23 16:09:37	JacolynDandreano	so I've been trying to think the best of alex too
2015-10-23 16:09:46	JacolynDandreano	but he just made me mad
2015-10-23 16:09:55	JacolynDandreano	anyway i just talked about him more than id like to
2015-10-23 16:10:01	JacolynDandreano	I'm just really tired of the chan atm
2015-10-23 16:10:05	JacolynDandreano	not sure if ill stay
2015-10-23 16:10:23	yama	in a way i thought he was better than phi because phi gets genuinely angry, but then he does stuff like this and idk
2015-10-23 16:10:31	yama	no dont leave :(
2015-10-23 16:11:54	JacolynDandreano	i honestly don't know. if people can't be mutually courteous, i don't want to stay. people don't need to get along, but people should be respectful enough. phi i can understand. alex i cant
2015-10-23 16:12:17	yama	he's just a bully
2015-10-23 16:12:48	yama	and the problem isn't so much that they're dicks imo, it's that they're dicks with op
2015-10-23 16:12:57	JacolynDandreano	and i actually put in effort to make it a nice sub for people. i try to welcome them and make sure their questions get answered and do stupid little cards for people's birthdays and make conversation if people aren't talking.  that's why it made me mad that he wasnt equally nice back
2015-10-23 16:12:58	yama	we could make another irc i suppose
2015-10-23 16:13:04	JacolynDandreano	i only have so much patience
2015-10-23 16:13:40	yama	but we appreciate that as you can see
2015-10-23 16:14:01	yama	also you can't see it, but when you're not around i welcome new people
2015-10-23 16:14:05	yama	not as nicely as you obviously
2015-10-23 16:16:06	yama	i honestly feel that as long as antranik and you are there, it balances out
2015-10-23 16:16:46	yama	668 is too much of a dick tho, i was hoping he'd get banned
2015-10-23 16:17:05	JacolynDandreano	I'm happy you do welcome people too
2015-10-23 16:17:33	JacolynDandreano	can't foxlet technically remove him or something
2015-10-23 16:18:01	yama	yeah but i guess he didn't want to go that far
2015-10-23 16:18:16	yama	specially since part of the blame was m092 giving him op
2015-10-23 16:20:18	JacolynDandreano	i dunno watts. i dunno. I'm done venting. I'm not leaving the chan yet, but it seriously made me less likely to stay
2015-10-23 16:20:52	yama	:(
2015-10-23 16:22:40	yama	on another note, i made the softest, wettest pizza dough i ever made
2015-10-23 16:22:44	yama	is wettest a word?
2015-10-23 16:22:50	yama	im following the pizza bible

2015-10-28 10:40:01	JacolynDandreano	so, can you summarize what was read so far so that I can see if I'm understanding it right?
2015-10-28 10:40:17	JacolynDandreano	I kinda get it, but it is still a little confusing.  Just less so now
2015-10-28 10:53:31	yama	the themes remind me of the anime Ghost in the Shell
2015-10-28 10:53:31	--	[JacolynDandreano] is away: Offline
2015-10-28 10:54:38	JacolynDandreano	never saw it obv
2015-10-28 10:54:39	JacolynDandreano	:P
2015-10-28 10:55:31	yama	its gooood
2015-10-28 10:56:42	JacolynDandreano	what makes an anime good
2015-10-28 10:57:27	yama	what makes a movie or a book good
2015-10-28 10:57:43	yama	anime just means it's animated and comes from japan
2015-10-28 10:58:36	yama	"Yet, as those criminals are revealed to have more depth than was at first apparent, the various protagonists are left with disturbing questions: "What exactly is the definition of 'human' in a society where a mind can be copied and the body replaced with a synthetic form?", "What exactly is the 'ghost' —the human soul— in the cybernetic body, or 'shell'?", "Where is the boundary between
2015-10-28 10:58:36	yama	human and machine when the differences between the two become more philosophical than physical?", etc."
2015-10-28 10:58:52	yama	that reminds me of Armitage
2015-10-28 11:01:22	JacolynDandreano	Yes, you are right.  I wasn't thinking of it in that way. I was just confused enough to not be thinking of themes.  Was just enjoying the plot development
2015-10-28 11:02:19	yama	yeah I feel I'm cheating cause I'm using a movie that came out later as a reference point :p
2015-10-28 11:02:53	yama	i do agree it's a bit confusing, but i kinda use that to let my imagination wonder and just picture all kinds of dystopian sci fi landscapes
2015-10-28 11:04:32	JacolynDandreano	I like this new place they are at right now in chapter 10
2015-10-28 11:04:35	JacolynDandreano	it sounds cool
2015-10-28 11:04:42	JacolynDandreano	at least the beginning of chapter 10
2015-10-28 11:04:51	JacolynDandreano	I think I ply got like 3 pages in :
2015-10-28 11:05:04	JacolynDandreano	only*
2015-10-28 11:05:07	yama	i can't recall where i left and the kindle is downstairs
2015-10-28 11:05:18	yama	i started another book about film lol
2015-10-28 11:05:20	JacolynDandreano	are you still in bed

2015-10-28 11:05:37	JacolynDandreano	which book
2015-10-28 11:06:03	yama	Film Art: an Introduction
2015-10-28 11:19:18	JacolynDandreano	sounds interesting. How do you like your kindle?
2015-10-28 11:19:59	yama	a lot
2015-10-28 11:20:19	yama	i like how comfortable it is to hold it with one hand
2015-10-28 11:21:30	JacolynDandreano	yeah, I use it almost exclusively for late night reading so that I can lie down while I read. Much easier than holding a book
2015-10-28 11:22:39	yama	get a paperwhiteee
2015-10-28 11:24:39	JacolynDandreano	:)

2015-10-28 11:30:45	yama	technically, the fire is more fancy

2015-10-28 11:31:17	JacolynDandreano	so predictable
2015-10-28 11:31:34	JacolynDandreano	I've been stuck in r/cozyplaces all morning
2015-10-28 11:32:34	yama	heh

2015-10-28 12:02:40	yama	i found some REALLY cheap good headphones and I'm enhancing the images and researching to know if it's fake
2015-10-28 12:07:46	JacolynDandreano	haha WOW! If I'm ever shopping for them I will come to you for help
2015-10-28 12:15:04	yama	what are you doing

2015-10-28 12:17:05	yama	but you're not in irc either
2015-10-28 12:17:22	yama	highly suspicious
2015-10-28 12:17:23	JacolynDandreano	I'm trying to limit my irc time to noon or later
2015-10-28 12:17:29	JacolynDandreano	why is that suspicious?!
2015-10-28 12:17:31	JacolynDandreano	lol
2015-10-28 12:17:56	yama	cause you're not doing work nor chatting!

2015-10-28 18:53:33	yama	the 1st pizza was a disaster but it was my fault
2015-10-28 18:53:36	yama	used too much water

2015-10-28 18:53:54	JacolynDandreano	tho you make pizza significantly more than me

2015-10-29 11:08:09	JacolynDandreano	good dreams or bad ones
2015-10-29 11:08:21	yama	they were okay
2015-10-29 11:09:04	JacolynDandreano	tell them to me. I'm super bored. i just went through all of the first Front and All page of reddit
2015-10-29 11:09:10	yama	wow
2015-10-29 11:09:38	yama	i barely recall, one was about being at school again, which is a recurrent subject for me
2015-10-29 11:09:45	yama	and another was about being at a party
2015-10-29 11:11:16	JacolynDandreano	maybe your subconscious wants you to go back to school :)
2015-10-29 11:11:36	JacolynDandreano	what did you do at this party? Eat empanadas?
2015-10-29 11:12:04	yama	hah no
2015-10-29 11:12:13	yama	the 2nd most predictable thing, after food
2015-10-29 11:14:39	JacolynDandreano	beer?
2015-10-29 11:14:42	JacolynDandreano	pot?
2015-10-29 11:14:52	yama	no
2015-10-29 11:14:59	yama	no that was a different dream ;)

2015-10-29 11:17:40	JacolynDandreano	ugh what else is at a party
2015-10-29 11:18:08	JacolynDandreano	the most predictable thing after food is clearly not that predictable
2015-10-29 11:19:07	yama	haha it is!
2015-10-29 11:19:20	JacolynDandreano	-.-
2015-10-29 11:19:30	yama	why would i go to a party besides food?
2015-10-29 11:19:32	JacolynDandreano	you're just messing with me now
2015-10-29 11:19:41	JacolynDandreano	video games?

2015-10-29 11:21:40	yama	no
2015-10-29 11:21:41	yama	no
2015-10-29 11:21:41	yama	no
2015-10-29 11:21:51	JacolynDandreano	there is nothing else
2015-10-29 11:21:54	yama	>me dancing
2015-10-29 11:22:07	JacolynDandreano	in your dreams? maybe you do
2015-10-29 11:22:07	JacolynDandreano	in your dreams? maybe you do
2015-10-29 11:22:10	yama	it's so obvious!
2015-10-29 11:22:22	JacolynDandreano	perhaps argentinian parties are very different from american
2015-10-29 11:22:25	JacolynDandreano	:P
2015-10-29 11:22:28	yama	no
2015-10-29 11:22:30	JacolynDandreano	i named everything
2015-10-29 11:22:33	yama	no
2015-10-29 11:22:36	yama	ugh
2015-10-29 11:22:41	JacolynDandreano	anyway i wouldn't go to a party except for food
2015-10-29 11:22:45	JacolynDandreano	or friends
2015-10-29 11:22:46	yama	why would a guy go to a party, besides food?
2015-10-29 11:22:56	JacolynDandreano	a guy specifically?  to get girls?
2015-10-29 11:23:00	JacolynDandreano	GIRLS
2015-10-29 11:23:00	yama	yes
2015-10-29 11:23:02	JacolynDandreano	is that it
2015-10-29 11:23:03	JacolynDandreano	lol
2015-10-29 11:23:13	yama	don't tell me that's not obvious
2015-10-29 11:23:52	JacolynDandreano	uh.... i guess.
2015-10-29 11:24:13	JacolynDandreano	i was thinking mostly activities
2015-10-29 11:24:20	JacolynDandreano	not specific types of people
2015-10-29 11:24:48	yama	:p
2015-10-29 11:25:02	JacolynDandreano	so you went to a party to look for grills and found them
2015-10-29 11:25:07	JacolynDandreano	anything else
2015-10-29 11:25:30	yama	nah it was just one girl, at least that's what i remember
2015-10-29 11:25:42	yama	didn't even talk to her, so i can't talk to girls even in my dreams
2015-10-29 11:25:45	yama	:)
2015-10-29 11:26:12	JacolynDandreano	haha geez
2015-10-29 11:26:17	JacolynDandreano	well did you at least make out?
2015-10-29 11:26:22	JacolynDandreano	or you just saw this girl
2015-10-29 11:26:36	yama	just looked at her
2015-10-29 11:26:46	yama	how would i make out without talking to her, im not that pro
2015-10-29 11:28:00	JacolynDandreano	pls. in dreams you can do whatever you want.  you could have totally just walked up to her, backed her against the wall and started making out. or she could have just jumped on top of you
2015-10-29 11:28:28	yama	not only am i lame within dreams, i am lame AT dreaming
2015-10-29 11:28:29	yama	:(
2015-10-29 11:28:35	JacolynDandreano	so sad that your dream involved just a few occasional glances :D
2015-10-29 11:28:43	yama	i bet if i did that she'd have rejected me
2015-10-29 11:28:50	yama	my dreams are very realistic apparently
2015-10-29 11:29:10	JacolynDandreano	haha
2015-10-29 11:29:24	JacolynDandreano	get better at dreaming silly
2015-10-29 11:29:38	yama	no i should get better at irl
2015-10-29 11:29:42	JacolynDandreano	or both
2015-10-29 11:30:15	yama	do girls liked being backed against the wall
2015-10-29 11:30:46	JacolynDandreano	uh having never met? probably not. unless the girl is totally into you and feeling adventurous
2015-10-29 11:30:50	JacolynDandreano	or is drunk prob
2015-10-29 11:31:15	JacolynDandreano	but yes i suppose if they liked you they would
2015-10-29 11:33:23	yama	but knowing that is impossible 
2015-10-29 11:33:26	yama	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2015-10-29 11:33:51	JacolynDandreano	haha
2015-10-29 11:34:29	JacolynDandreano	i just mean that you can't see a girl and without having ever met her do that.  it would seem a bit rapey i think, unless she was attracted to you
2015-10-29 11:34:35	JacolynDandreano	it works in movies
2015-10-29 11:34:53	JacolynDandreano	but irl i suppose there would need to be some expression of attraction first
2015-10-29 11:35:02	JacolynDandreano	and then it would depend on the environment
2015-10-29 11:35:13	yama	or if you're a 10/10
2015-10-29 11:35:22	JacolynDandreano	pls no one is
2015-10-29 11:35:53	JacolynDandreano	like if you did it in a crowded store, it is not really a sensual environment, so it probably wouldn't work
2015-10-29 11:36:03	yama	i guess
2015-10-29 11:36:10	JacolynDandreano	but if you were at a party and there was music and the lights were dim, it might work
2015-10-29 11:37:06	JacolynDandreano	and, even if you were a 10/10, it is possible you aren't that person's type
2015-10-29 11:37:36	yama	i wish i was someone's type
2015-10-29 11:38:25	JacolynDandreano	shutup. guys with beards are all the latest rage
2015-10-29 11:40:16	yama	i trimmed it recently
2015-10-29 11:46:42	JacolynDandreano	let me see it
2015-10-29 11:46:56	JacolynDandreano	or is it still the same length

2015-10-29 12:51:14	yama	usually it's tuna sandwiches
2015-10-29 12:51:43	JacolynDandreano	oh cool
2015-10-29 12:51:54	yama	where are the pics
2015-10-29 12:56:01	JacolynDandreano	in my mind
2015-10-29 12:57:22	yama	<_<
2015-10-29 12:59:24	JacolynDandreano	:P
2015-10-29 13:00:45	yama	ur a tease
2015-10-29 13:01:46	JacolynDandreano	what? how?
2015-10-29 13:01:52	JacolynDandreano	you asked what i was doing and i told you
2015-10-29 13:01:59	JacolynDandreano	i never said i had decided to share
2015-10-29 13:02:08	yama	fine
2015-10-29 13:02:23	JacolynDandreano	I'm still undecided about whether or not to actually post them in my irc progress
2015-10-29 13:02:34	yama	do it
2015-10-29 13:02:42	yama	i recorded hs and lsit but didn't upload
2015-10-29 13:02:51	JacolynDandreano	why wouldn't you
2015-10-29 13:03:02	JacolynDandreano	we never see form check vids from you
2015-10-29 13:04:01	JacolynDandreano	the thing is, the progress pics are really horrible.  i look extremely fat. but, on the other hand, i took them specifically b/c i finally feel motivated to diet and exercise properly, so i do want to track the progress from the worst to the not-as-bad future
2015-10-29 13:04:16	JacolynDandreano	that's why I'm not sure :P
2015-10-29 13:04:38	yama	well post them on irc and you'll get a bunch of compliments 
2015-10-29 13:06:28	JacolynDandreano	probably not
2015-10-29 13:06:48	JacolynDandreano	some people on irc are really critical
2015-10-29 13:07:21	yama	that's why you choose when to post them :p
2015-10-29 13:09:19	JacolynDandreano	so wait for nice liars to be on so that i can get fake compliments to make myself feel better?
2015-10-29 13:09:32	yama	you make me sad :(
2015-10-29 13:09:45	JacolynDandreano	why
2015-10-29 13:10:06	yama	you call me a liar
2015-10-29 13:10:45	JacolynDandreano	Sorry, but if I were to get a compliment with these pics, I would not believe it.  They're worse than when I started BWF in the first place
2015-10-29 13:10:58	JacolynDandreano	at least i feel motivated by my even worse body now
2015-10-29 13:11:00	JacolynDandreano	lol
2015-10-29 13:11:23	yama	i will never believe your own opinion of yourself
2015-10-29 13:11:56	JacolynDandreano	well you would if you saw these
2015-10-29 13:12:00	JacolynDandreano	im not even slightly joking
2015-10-29 13:12:24	JacolynDandreano	no muscles are visible in unflexed.
2015-10-29 13:12:54	yama	that doesn't mean you look bad
2015-10-29 13:14:16	JacolynDandreano	whatever i am not going to argue about it. i just feel bad about it
2015-10-29 13:15:28	yama	ok
2015-10-29 13:17:30	JacolynDandreano	i guess ill just put them in the quotes and get it over with. my goal is to have lost significant amount of weight by the end of November. Even if it means barely eating at Thanksgiving
2015-10-29 13:19:27	*	yama looks through the quotes
2015-10-29 13:24:25	yama	you look FINE

2015-10-29 13:26:50	yama	everyone agress
2015-10-29 13:26:52	yama	agrees
2015-10-29 13:36:37	JacolynDandreano	the thing is, I'm pretty sure they are saying that b/c they know I've been unmotivated for two months
2015-10-29 13:43:33	yama	nah, you still look skinny and fit
2015-10-29 13:43:49	yama	im pretty sure lots of women would love to look like that with "bad diet"
2015-10-29 13:47:43	JacolynDandreano	ty watts <3 you're really sweet
2015-10-29 13:54:14	yama	i found some old european movies that were on my watchlist being played at a theater :D
2015-10-29 13:57:46	JacolynDandreano	that's awesome. do they charge less b/c they are so old?
2015-10-29 13:57:59	yama	ye
2015-10-29 13:58:10	yama	compared to the theater i went to last night ;/
2015-10-29 13:58:17	yama	i'd still pay more tho
2015-10-29 13:58:24	yama	because it's so rare
2015-10-29 14:01:56	JacolynDandreano	who are you going with
2015-10-29 14:02:23	yama	sadfrog
2015-10-29 14:03:09	yama	as if i knew anyone who'd enjoy b&w movies from the 60s
2015-10-29 14:06:09	JacolynDandreano	i'd go with you even if i don't particularly like those types of movies
2015-10-29 14:06:37	yama	ty :)
2015-10-29 14:06:38	JacolynDandreano	id have a grand old time. you'd get annoyed b/c i sometimes talk in movies. depending on the genre
2015-10-29 14:06:58	yama	i'll watch them both back to back with a 30min break in between tho
2015-10-29 14:09:30	JacolynDandreano	i watched the entire twilight series at the movie theater b/c a friend wanted me to go with them.  i think it ended up being a total of 10-12 hours in the theater
2015-10-29 14:18:51	yama	would literally kill myself
2015-10-29 14:18:52	yama	lol
2015-10-29 14:20:32	JacolynDandreano	:D
2015-10-29 14:20:41	JacolynDandreano	anything is fun with friends
2015-10-29 14:20:44	JacolynDandreano	it wasnt THAT bad
2015-10-29 14:20:54	JacolynDandreano	i brought a big fluffy blanket and a ton of snacks tho
2015-10-29 14:21:01	JacolynDandreano	so it was just as nice as being home
2015-10-29 14:21:24	JacolynDandreano	and the theater i was in had recently renovated and added chairs where the armrests come up and they recline a bit
2015-10-29 14:21:27	JacolynDandreano	very comfortable
2015-10-29 14:23:11	yama	i'd have annoyed my friend by laughing at the movie all the time
2015-10-29 14:25:51	JacolynDandreano	:) she annoyed me more
2015-10-29 14:40:30	yama	hah
2015-10-29 14:40:43	yama	also i doubt there's popcorn at this theater
2015-10-29 14:40:50	yama	but i'd make you empanadas to compensate
2015-10-29 14:42:43	JacolynDandreano	:O when can we do this
2015-10-29 14:43:17	yama	when you arrive here :)
2015-10-29 15:19:18	yama	im having crackers with pb&j
2015-10-29 15:30:01	JacolynDandreano	im not sure how i feel about that
2015-10-29 15:30:03	JacolynDandreano	lol
2015-10-29 15:30:12	JacolynDandreano	i guess it is the same as on a sandwich
2015-10-29 15:30:33	yama	on a sandwich seems weird to me
2015-10-29 15:30:45	yama	sandwiches have meat or at least cheese here
2015-10-29 15:33:24	JacolynDandreano	pb&j is almost exclusively on bread here
2015-10-29 15:33:31	JacolynDandreano	well is generally eaten on bread

2015-10-30 23:45:59	yama	or are you leaving
2015-10-31 00:13:29	JacolynDandreano	I'm just reading
2015-10-31 00:13:42	JacolynDandreano	almost done with chapter 11
2015-10-31 00:21:39	yama	o
2015-10-31 00:23:23	JacolynDandreano	Starting ch 12
2015-10-31 00:23:37	JacolynDandreano	im gonna fly past you
2015-10-31 00:23:51	JacolynDandreano	Or at least a page past you
2015-10-31 00:24:22	yama	hah
2015-10-31 00:24:50	JacolynDandreano	im slightly confused about Molly's story. I get the main gist... So she was a prostitute in cyberspace but not irl?
2015-10-31 00:25:20	JacolynDandreano	Like the chip enabled her to sleep with people in the matrix?
2015-10-31 00:25:31	yama	the way i took it, she was a "puppet"
2015-10-31 00:25:54	yama	no, I think it just made her black out mentally, but her body basically did whatever the client wanted i guess
2015-10-31 00:26:08	yama	that's how i understood it
2015-10-31 00:26:47	JacolynDandreano	But she said that during a surgery, someone messed with the chip and she had been in the middle of a snuff thing or something... I didn't really get that part
2015-10-31 00:27:29	yama	i thought she meant like during the surgery she suddenly came across those memories
2015-10-31 00:27:35	yama	i'd have to re-read it
2015-10-31 00:29:07	JacolynDandreano	Oh it seems like they interrupted something during surgery. Because the client, the senator, kept asking what was wrong
2015-10-31 00:29:54	JacolynDandreano	Oh no I reread it. Maybe you're right.
2015-10-31 00:30:21	JacolynDandreano	She must have been remembering those things
2015-10-31 00:30:33	JacolynDandreano	nevermind. I'm dumb
2015-10-31 00:30:45	yama	does she say it clear?
2015-10-31 00:30:59	JacolynDandreano	Not really
2015-10-31 00:31:06	JacolynDandreano	this book is so odd
2015-10-31 00:31:42	yama	i'll read that bit again too if i remember
2015-10-31 00:39:48	JacolynDandreano	Ok cool. I'm going to bed in a few minutes. Will finish chapter 12 first tho  I think because it is short. Sweet dreams
2015-10-31 00:40:08	yama	oh, maybe i will too later
2015-10-31 00:40:09	yama	gn
2015-10-31 00:40:48	JacolynDandreano	Night

2015-10-31 00:41:47	JacolynDandreano	I didn't feel so good after the margarita so I stopped drinking
2015-10-31 00:42:01	yama	aw
2015-10-31 00:42:09	yama	well i hope you're better tomorrow
2015-10-31 00:42:53	JacolynDandreano	Thanks :)
2015-10-31 00:43:25	JacolynDandreano	I may drink the whiskey tomorrow. But then you won't be here to talk to me so you may miss it :P

2015-11-03 21:45:51	JacolynDandreano	No I told myself I would wait a week of healthy eating before checking my weight because I knew that I would get really discouraged if it was bad.  But then I checked today anyway and I've gained like 4.5lb since August. I feel really upset with all of this and embarrassed to be seen in public. I'm so upset that I feel like eating more to make myself feel better.
2015-11-03 21:47:12	yama	wut embarrased?
2015-11-03 21:47:31	yama	how much is 4.5lbs, like 1 kg?

2015-11-03 21:57:32	JacolynDandreano	It isn't just the scale. I can feel it. Maybe I should start cardio again and just deal with losing my butt and boobs

2015-11-05 22:03:01	JacolynDandreano	What chapter are you on again
2015-11-05 22:03:05	yama	i am
2015-11-05 22:03:16	yama	and she's a good cook for some things, not as versatile as you
2015-11-05 22:03:19	yama	17
2015-11-05 22:03:49	JacolynDandreano	How so?
2015-11-05 22:06:35	yama	she NEVER uses spices for example cause she doesn't eat anything remotely spicy
2015-11-05 22:06:39	yama	has a weak stomach
2015-11-05 22:07:15	yama	so like onions have to be washed and let them soak in water and then throw the water away cause if she makes them caramelized or fried her stomach bothers her
2015-11-05 22:07:18	yama	stuff like that
2015-11-05 22:12:06	JacolynDandreano	Aw that sucks
2015-11-05 22:12:17	JacolynDandreano	So is the food bland
2015-11-05 22:12:31	yama	the food that sort of requires that, ye

2015-11-05 22:15:59	yama	i shaved my neck and it's so smooth
2015-11-05 22:16:19	JacolynDandreano	no because my apt is small. Only one bathroom so if they need to use it I don't want to be bathing in there
2015-11-05 22:16:27	yama	o

2015-11-05 22:46:13	JacolynDandreano	i iron SO's clothes, make my lunch. Shower and pick out my clothes and dress. Do any dishes that are out. Brush my hair and teeth
2015-11-05 22:46:28	JacolynDandreano	Morning 1x36 h2t on each side
2015-11-05 22:46:49	JacolynDandreano	Time flies by
2015-11-05 22:46:50	yama	i'd die
2015-11-05 22:46:54	yama	and get a divorce
2015-11-05 22:47:00	yama	or do all that the day before
2015-11-05 22:47:22	yama	i get up, get dressed, make bf and leave

2015-11-05 22:48:56	JacolynDandreano	Oh. I've gotten used to waking at 6:30
2015-11-05 22:49:25	JacolynDandreano	If I stay in bed it is because the blankets and pillow are too comfortable. Usually not because I want more sleep
2015-11-05 22:49:51	JacolynDandreano	But you also go to bed way later than me
2015-11-05 22:50:42	yama	ye

2015-11-05 23:03:54	yama	see you just wanna get rid of me
2015-11-06 16:21:27	JacolynDandreano	Ah well it is a kindle book. It gets returned on the due date or if you go on your amazon account and return it earlier. However, I have often just turned off my kindle's wifi and kept the book for as long as needed. Once wifi is turned on past the due date it automatically returns. But I don't think I'll need the book much longer. I plan to read more this weekend.
2015-11-06 16:25:53	yama	ill tell the police o:

2015-11-12 23:07:26	JacolynDandreano	Yes can't wait to discuss it with you when I finish. Tho I still don't entirely get the whole 3jane thing
2015-11-12 23:07:34	JacolynDandreano	hey do u still like me? Am I ur friend? Or do u get annoyed with me now
2015-11-12 23:08:10	yama	i miss you

2015-11-12 23:09:25	yama	are you feeling better about yourself?
2015-11-12 23:14:14	JacolynDandreano	I miss u too. And I totally like u just as much. Which is a lot. :) and I'm off and on with how I feel about myself. Today was somewhat of a happier day. Just super busy
2015-11-12 23:14:48	yama	well i didn't say you actually like me any less, it's just how it feels :p
2015-11-12 23:15:13	JacolynDandreano	:( don't feel that way
2015-11-12 23:15:15	yama	but what im asking is, is the break helping you feel any better? would you have felt worse these days if you were online more?
2015-11-12 23:16:09	JacolynDandreano	I dunno. I needed a break. I do feel better. Staring at a screen all day was having negative effects on me I think.
2015-11-12 23:16:21	JacolynDandreano	I've been more productive at work
2015-11-12 23:17:15	JacolynDandreano	Also, I let myself get too emotionally attached or addicted to irc I think. It was better that I backed off.
2015-11-12 23:17:24	JacolynDandreano	i bet people don't even know I'm gone
2015-11-12 23:17:34	JacolynDandreano	other than u and phi and jokester

2015-11-12 23:20:13	yama	didn't talk
2015-11-12 23:20:37	yama	and he banned him right away cause "legato just wants a soapbox"
2015-11-12 23:20:40	JacolynDandreano	:(
2015-11-12 23:20:47	yama	which is true, but he's a dick

2015-11-12 23:23:20	JacolynDandreano	You mean I talked more
2015-11-12 23:23:31	JacolynDandreano	anyway I think I did a good job of phasing out
2015-11-12 23:23:36	JacolynDandreano	and fading away
2015-11-12 23:24:00	yama	:(
2015-11-12 23:24:02	JacolynDandreano	Are there a lot of new ppl joining? Do ppl welcome the new ppl and answer their questions?

2015-11-12 23:28:45	JacolynDandreano	I want to add in cardio, but it has been raining
2015-11-12 23:30:02	yama	my workout today made me depressed
2015-11-12 23:30:16	yama	and then making food cheered me up
2015-11-12 23:30:25	yama	what does that say about me -_-
2015-11-12 23:34:07	JacolynDandreano	Haha. Food comforts me but then makes me feel worse

2015-11-13 13:03:34	yama	and i only talked about neuro
2015-11-13 13:03:39	yama	i will make another one
2015-11-13 13:23:28	JacolynDandreano	nah just share that one
2015-11-13 14:17:04	yama	fine
2015-11-13 14:17:07	yama	only cause im busy
2015-11-13 14:32:52	JacolynDandreano	thanks!
2015-11-13 14:41:39	JacolynDandreano	i felt the same way as you about Riviera. He just seemed like a minor character who was helping out, and then he seemed to become more villainous.  Anyway, I haven't read the last 5% of the kindle book which might be extra information about the book from Jack Womack, so I'm going to read that and then maybe some other things.  I didn't really understand wintermute's motives.  I just thought he was trying to disable
2015-11-13 14:41:39	JacolynDandreano	another AI and needed Case's help to do it.  And Case was playing along b/c of the toxins implanted in his body.  And I thought they were planting a virus in wintermute, but then it didn't seem to work at the end. So, I must have gotten that all wrong.  Also, I was confused about 3Jane's part in all of this.
2015-11-13 14:42:33	JacolynDandreano	My favorite scene tho was the beach scene w/ Linda.  The landscape there reminded me of Inception. I wonder if that movie took some ideas from the book
2015-11-13 15:00:53	JacolynDandreano	the shelfari book club that I'm a part of (the one with the 1001 Books to Read Before You Die list had read Neuro a few years ago. I found a brief bio/synopsis and the discussion questions...
2015-11-13 15:01:39	JacolynDandreano	* Non-Displayable Attachments *
2015-11-13 15:17:09	yama	yeah 3jane was confusing too, but im pretty sure the virus was wintermute's plan
2015-11-13 15:33:18	JacolynDandreano	yeah i thought it was his plan. but was the virus meant to attack winter mute? or someone else
2015-11-13 15:33:42	yama	the virus was meant to help free wintermute
2015-11-13 15:34:44	JacolynDandreano	see, i didn't really get that he needed to be free from anything
2015-11-13 15:36:05	yama	it wanted to merge with neuromancer
2015-11-13 15:36:20	yama	at the end it describes both their personalities as if they complete each other
2015-11-13 15:36:30	JacolynDandreano	my view of the plot is like a puzzle and i have a whole bunch of pieces that i think go together, but when i try to put them together, they don't work. but i jam them together anyway b/c i don't know where else to fit them
2015-11-13 15:37:45	JacolynDandreano	see i thought the end shows that winter mute and neuromancer are just parts of a giant cyber-reality, "the matrix" and are just different "masks" that the matrix takes on.
2015-11-13 15:37:49	JacolynDandreano	whatever
2015-11-13 15:37:59	JacolynDandreano	you obviously understood the whole thing
2015-11-13 15:38:03	JacolynDandreano	i don't think I'm nerdy enough
2015-11-13 15:38:19	yama	they were built by tessier-ashpool i think
2015-11-13 15:39:09	JacolynDandreano	ugh im gonna need to read up on it
2015-11-13 15:39:40	yama	and wintermute "revived" corto by giving him a new personality, and made him gather up the team
2015-11-13 15:39:48	yama	i'll have to read on riviera
2015-11-13 15:42:23	JacolynDandreano	but corto was human, right?
2015-11-13 15:43:00	yama	at first yes, im guessing he was some sort of cyborg at the point we meet him in the book
2015-11-13 15:44:19	JacolynDandreano	meh i didn't like this book very much
2015-11-13 15:44:27	yama	:(
2015-11-13 15:45:12	JacolynDandreano	i didn't connect with the characters, didn't understand the plot, didn't understand the vocabulary, couldn't really appreciate the settings (except for the beach)
2015-11-13 15:45:28	yama	you were liking it last time we talked
2015-11-13 15:45:56	JacolynDandreano	well i was also hoping that id get a better understanding of it later on
2015-11-13 15:46:39	JacolynDandreano	but once i ended it, i realized that there wasnt much i liked about it. I'm happy i read it b/c of its contribution to the cyberpunk world, but i didn't really connect with the book at all
2015-11-13 15:47:01	yama	;/
2015-11-13 15:47:03	JacolynDandreano	i literally only liked the beach scene.
2015-11-13 15:47:19	JacolynDandreano	and that's probably b/c the imagery was so vivid
2015-11-13 16:13:43	JacolynDandreano	No, you choose the books
2015-11-13 16:14:01	JacolynDandreano	the next one. as long as it is on the list and i can actually get it, I'm fine with whatever
2015-11-13 16:19:43	yama	but i chose this one and you didnt like it :(
2015-11-13 16:21:10	JacolynDandreano	so? it was on my to-read list. I'm not going to like every book on there. :) sometimes i can just appreciate a book for its contributions to literature without liking the book itself. i bet you'd feel the same about movies or music
2015-11-13 16:21:45	JacolynDandreano	OR you can pick a random number from 1-1294 and we will read it no matter what unless we have already read it or can't find it.
2015-11-13 16:21:50	JacolynDandreano	maybe that is a better way to pick
2015-11-13 16:21:53	JacolynDandreano	which would you prefer
2015-11-13 16:27:32	yama	uhh
2015-11-13 16:27:44	yama	if i wanted to read every book on that list, maybe
2015-11-13 16:29:02	JacolynDandreano	:P fine. tell me which you want to read next... http://pastebin.com/Tcq0BZBb
2015-11-13 16:30:34	yama	the windup bird
2015-11-13 16:30:50	yama	cause i was planning to read it and i already downloaded it ha
2015-11-13 16:32:59	JacolynDandreano	ha alright let me see if the library has it
2015-11-13 16:33:01	JacolynDandreano	:P
2015-11-13 16:33:31	JacolynDandreano	by murakami?
2015-11-13 16:33:33	yama	yes
2015-11-13 16:33:47	yama	i can't tell you how many times i've seen murakami mentioned
2015-11-13 16:33:54	yama	the universe wants me to read him
2015-11-13 16:36:17	JacolynDandreano	alright. i know nothing about him other than that people like him. is this book part of a series
2015-11-13 16:38:42	yama	no clue
2015-11-13 16:38:50	JacolynDandreano	i feel like my preference for 19th century lit makes me think i won't like this already
2015-11-13 16:38:58	JacolynDandreano	jk im gonna be openminded
2015-11-13 16:39:08	yama	i asked which one to start with and like 3 people said they started with this one
2015-11-13 16:39:14	yama	YOU choose then
2015-11-13 16:39:19	yama	i'll feel guilty
2015-11-13 16:40:55	JacolynDandreano	no don't feel guilty. I'm happy about reading books i don't necessarily like.  maybe ill be pleasantly surprised too. :)  The tone is apparently "romantic, melancholy, mystical, and reflective" and i like the first 3 in a book, so maybe ill like this
2015-11-13 16:44:31	yama	i like the last 3
2015-11-13 16:44:46	yama	i think his genre is magical realism, which i usually love
2015-11-13 16:54:10	JacolynDandreano	ok i requested it from the library. should be able to get it in a day or two. in the meantime i will read more of the count haha
2015-11-13 16:54:54	yama	cool, i'll finish fahrenheit and wait for you
2015-11-13 16:55:06	yama	my pamls touched the floor for like half a second
2015-11-13 16:55:18	JacolynDandreano	you don't need to wait. it is over 600 pages. you can start whenever you want
2015-11-13 16:55:28	JacolynDandreano	oh, really?! wow, that's fast progress!
2015-11-13 16:55:32	JacolynDandreano	i bet you were proud

2015-11-13 17:07:06	JacolynDandreano	:OOOOO woah! was it painful? soon you'll be doing h2t. also, you are the whitest Spanish-speaker I know.  That's including moter8

2015-11-13 17:07:40	yama	haha are you saying i need a tan :(
2015-11-13 17:07:44	JacolynDandreano	yes
2015-11-13 17:07:58	JacolynDandreano	now that it is gonna be summer for you, you should go to the beach
2015-11-13 17:08:53	yama	i doubt i'll be going through h2t given how you wanted to die and throw up while doing it :p
2015-11-13 17:09:44	yama	i dont have a beach near
2015-11-13 17:09:50	yama	just pool
2015-11-13 17:11:37	JacolynDandreano	yes i suppose I won't be able to convince anyone to do it. I've stopped it btw. haven't had time to actually stretch
2015-11-13 17:13:00	JacolynDandreano	well get a tan at the pool
2015-11-13 17:13:04	JacolynDandreano	is it warm enough to swim yet
2015-11-13 17:13:20	yama	it was 2 days ago
2015-11-13 17:13:24	yama	but now it's not

2015-11-14 16:42:01	--	[JacolynDandreano] is away: Offline
2015-11-14 16:47:53	JacolynDandreano	No. I am sitting on my couch in two blankets, starting chapter 47 of the count and debating a cup of hot chocolate made with half and half
2015-11-14 16:48:16	JacolynDandreano	Did u start Murakami yet?
2015-11-14 16:48:51	yama	no, when i finish fahrenheit
2015-11-14 16:49:06	yama	half and half what
2015-11-14 16:51:18	JacolynDandreano	Half and half is a type of cream
2015-11-14 16:51:26	JacolynDandreano	often used for coffee
2015-11-14 16:51:39	yama	oh
2015-11-14 16:51:57	JacolynDandreano	less fat content than whipping or heavy cream, but more fat than whole milk
2015-11-14 16:52:23	yama	i had coffee with whipped cream earlier
2015-11-14 16:53:20	JacolynDandreano	I love whipped cream
2015-11-14 16:53:41	JacolynDandreano	oh I can make some for my hot chocolate because I have some whipping cream too
2015-11-14 16:53:51	JacolynDandreano	will be a thousand cal
2015-11-14 16:54:05	JacolynDandreano	Ok back to reading. Still haven't started the chapter lol
2015-11-14 16:54:13	yama	i thought whipped cream didn't have that many calories
2015-11-14 16:54:17	JacolynDandreano	im 43% done with the count lol
2015-11-14 16:54:21	yama	fine :(
2015-11-14 16:54:49	JacolynDandreano	it doesn't. But when u put whipped cream on top of hot chocolate made with a full mug of half and half it does :P
2015-11-14 16:55:22	yama	oh
2015-11-17 21:07:14	JacolynDandreano	Well I guess I just have horrible balance

2015-11-17 21:11:06	yama	it's like you're disciplined despite yourself
2015-11-17 21:11:59	JacolynDandreano	:D I wish
2015-11-17 21:12:16	JacolynDandreano	I don't think one day of semi-good behavior counts
2015-11-17 21:12:29	yama	you do h2t so often tho
2015-11-17 21:12:50	JacolynDandreano	No I skipped two weeks

2015-11-17 21:15:30	yama	btw when i was walking home i crossed path with a girl i went to highschool with
2015-11-17 21:15:34	yama	and i didnt say anything
2015-11-17 21:16:45	JacolynDandreano	Why not
2015-11-17 21:17:16	JacolynDandreano	ugh helgi told me my form is all wrong on the side h2t pulses. And I can't do it the way he said to :/
2015-11-17 21:17:46	yama	because im me
2015-11-17 21:17:49	yama	what is wrong with it?
2015-11-17 21:18:43	JacolynDandreano	I need to open more to the side
2015-11-17 21:18:53	JacolynDandreano	and hips should actually be perpendicular
2015-11-17 21:18:57	JacolynDandreano	and I can't do it
2015-11-17 21:19:06	JacolynDandreano	I just literally cant
2015-11-17 21:19:11	yama	give it time
2015-11-17 21:20:07	JacolynDandreano	I mean I can only do one or two and it is painful and bad form
2015-11-17 21:20:24	JacolynDandreano	i don't think I'm capable of correcting it
2015-11-17 21:20:43	yama	you're spoiled cause you got h2t so quickly
2015-11-17 21:21:35	JacolynDandreano	Perhaps :P
2015-11-17 21:21:47	JacolynDandreano	but I think maybe I'm just not flexible enough
2015-11-17 21:21:52	yama	duh
2015-11-17 21:21:58	yama	that's why you work to get more flexible
2015-11-17 21:21:58	JacolynDandreano	or I can say that my butt gets in the way
2015-11-17 21:22:15	yama	uh i dont think you can use that excuse here
2015-11-17 21:22:24	yama	unless you prove it with pics :)
2015-11-17 21:22:29	JacolynDandreano	No I mean the type of flexible that I will never be
2015-11-17 21:23:04	JacolynDandreano	Haha sorry I have no pics.but I'm p sure it would be easier without the butt cheek getting in the way of the bend
2015-11-17 21:23:19	JacolynDandreano	Or I'm just too fat
2015-11-17 21:23:22	JacolynDandreano	ugh I dunno
2015-11-17 21:23:34	JacolynDandreano	i guess I'll stick with regular h2t for now
2015-11-17 21:23:42	JacolynDandreano	And try to get front splits
2015-11-17 21:23:44	yama	i honestly can't picture how it'd get in the way but im neither nowhere near that flexible nor do i have a big butt
2015-11-17 21:24:42	JacolynDandreano	It just feels like it does
2015-11-17 21:25:07	JacolynDandreano	But it also felt that way with tuck lsit so I might be wrong
2015-11-17 21:25:32	JacolynDandreano	Tho that was more hip width I guess
2015-11-17 21:29:40	yama	u just love talking about your hips :^)
2015-11-17 21:42:38	JacolynDandreano	No. I'm just terribly annoyed that I can't get the angle
2015-11-17 21:42:44	JacolynDandreano	I gave up on it
2015-11-17 21:42:49	JacolynDandreano	shower time brb

2015-11-17 22:19:37	yama	i can't say i have an opinion really
2015-11-17 22:19:41	yama	okay i guess
2015-11-17 22:20:50	JacolynDandreano	Oh. I see

2015-11-17 22:27:57	yama	i gotta go to bed in like an hour
2015-11-17 22:28:39	JacolynDandreano	Abuelo Germán
2015-11-17 22:28:47	JacolynDandreano	Talk on irc
2015-11-18 21:11:41	JacolynDandreano	You don't earn $20 a day?
2015-11-18 21:11:58	JacolynDandreano	Are you working for free?
2015-11-18 21:13:19	yama	depends how much i sell
2015-11-18 21:13:19	--	[JacolynDandreano] is away: Offline
2015-11-18 21:14:21	JacolynDandreano	Ah so you have no base pay, just commission?
2015-11-18 21:14:32	JacolynDandreano	do you like having a sales job?
2015-11-18 21:14:40	yama	yes
2015-11-18 21:14:42	yama	and no
2015-11-18 21:14:51	yama	i get payed on the day
2015-11-18 21:15:37	JacolynDandreano	I would hate having a sales job. I wouldn't make a single sale
2015-11-18 21:16:03	yama	you would make more than me probably
2015-11-18 21:17:29	JacolynDandreano	No. I remember one guy at the mall said that they were hiring and I said "I can't do sales" and he said "I'm sure you can. It is easy. Try to sell me this pen" so I stared blankly for a long moment and had nothing to say. Was very awkward
2015-11-18 21:17:36	JacolynDandreano	then I said sorry and left
2015-11-18 21:17:58	JacolynDandreano	It is also why I can't do waitressing
2015-11-18 21:17:58	yama	well duh
2015-11-18 21:18:03	yama	i started like that too
2015-11-18 21:18:09	yama	and even now im just mediocre
2015-11-18 21:18:24	JacolynDandreano	Do you approach ppl in your store
2015-11-18 21:18:31	yama	my boss can sell things really expensively
2015-11-18 21:18:34	JacolynDandreano	or do you wait for them to ask a question
2015-11-18 21:18:35	yama	but she's a lawyer
2015-11-18 21:18:59	yama	haven't you seen how tiny it is? :p when they enter they're 5 feet from me
2015-11-18 21:19:15	yama	so i say hello 99% of the time
2015-11-18 21:19:24	JacolynDandreano	Oh I didn't realize it was THAT small
2015-11-18 21:19:32	JacolynDandreano	so what is your spiel
2015-11-18 21:19:36	yama	sometimes i can't tell someone walked in cause im reading or talking to you and im startled
2015-11-18 21:19:41	JacolynDandreano	pretend I'm a customer
2015-11-18 21:19:49	JacolynDandreano	what do you say to me
2015-11-18 21:20:07	yama	hello, good morning
2015-11-18 21:20:25	yama	(usually they say something)
2015-11-18 21:20:31	yama	sometimes before i even say hello
2015-11-18 21:21:16	JacolynDandreano	And then I say hi and say that I'm looking for a gift for my little sister
2015-11-18 21:21:20	JacolynDandreano	now sell it to me
2015-11-18 21:21:39	yama	i'd just ask the model of the phone
2015-11-18 21:21:43	yama	and what kind of cover you want
2015-11-18 21:21:47	yama	flip cover or back cover
2015-11-18 21:21:52	JacolynDandreano	Is it only covers
2015-11-18 21:22:10	JacolynDandreano	What if I seem indecisive?
2015-11-18 21:22:16	JacolynDandreano	Do u press me
2015-11-18 21:22:40	yama	i show you both
2015-11-18 21:23:06	JacolynDandreano	What if I say I'm not sure if I want to buy it or not
2015-11-18 21:23:15	JacolynDandreano	Do you talk me into it
2015-11-18 21:25:17	JacolynDandreano	I'm cold
2015-11-18 21:25:57	yama	i'd probably ask what kind of thing you had in mind initially
2015-11-18 21:26:16	yama	or i'd show you different colors of the same models, sometimes people go "yes she would like that color"
2015-11-18 21:26:49	JacolynDandreano	Are all the stores in that strip as small as yours
2015-11-18 21:29:09	yama	no
2015-11-18 21:29:16	yama	most are nicer :p
2015-11-18 21:29:21	yama	but they sell more expensive stuff
2015-11-18 21:29:29	JacolynDandreano	Also are you going to do the recording soon
2015-11-18 21:29:35	JacolynDandreano	im in chapter 2
2015-11-18 21:29:36	yama	the guy across me, who's really cool and lends me his wifi, sells leather stuff
2015-11-18 21:29:39	yama	HURRY
2015-11-18 21:29:43	yama	i'll do it later
2015-11-18 21:29:44	yama	in bed
2015-11-18 21:29:48	yama	im having dinner
2015-11-18 21:30:09	JacolynDandreano	Ugh why not just do it after dinner. Why wait until bed
2015-11-18 21:30:20	JacolynDandreano	You want to talk to me in bed ;)
2015-11-18 21:30:59	JacolynDandreano	Actually if you send it with Dropbox I probably won't see it until tomorrow at work anyway
2015-11-18 21:31:08	yama	you got me
2015-11-18 21:31:18	yama	im gonna play piano after dinner
2015-11-18 21:31:24	yama	im not sure how else to send it
2015-11-18 21:31:33	yama	if you had slack :)
2015-11-18 21:32:36	JacolynDandreano	:/ what about vocaroo
2015-11-18 21:32:48	JacolynDandreano	also his wife is so rude rn
2015-11-18 21:32:53	JacolynDandreano	I don't like her
2015-11-18 21:33:26	JacolynDandreano	also I wonder if the reader is meant to predict that his wife is cheating on him with all these hints. Probably.
2015-11-18 21:33:34	yama	oh i could try
2015-11-18 21:34:37	yama	i find this book very interesting because besides the absurd things that happen to him, i find it very realistic in his thoughts and depiction of actions
2015-11-18 21:35:12	JacolynDandreano	Yeah tho he is made out to be a little too good rn
2015-11-18 21:35:22	yama	like at some point he describes scratching his neck with a pencil and it's a tiny detail makes it feel more real
2015-11-18 21:35:37	yama	he seems a bit of a passive person
2015-11-18 21:35:41	yama	very japanese :p
2015-11-18 21:35:47	yama	are you imagining everyone japanese already?
2015-11-18 21:36:23	JacolynDandreano	No. Just his wife. Probably because she has a Japanese name which is said several times here
2015-11-18 21:36:57	yama	and the cat
2015-11-18 21:37:01	JacolynDandreano	Also I like reading the ePub book because it is fast reading, but it is missing major punctuation like quotation marks
2015-11-18 21:37:12	JacolynDandreano	yes I'm picturing a Japanese cat ;)
2015-11-18 21:37:15	yama	which has the wife's brother's name
2015-11-18 21:37:16	yama	hah
2015-11-18 21:37:21	yama	yes i noticed that :/
2015-11-18 21:37:27	yama	i'll try to get you a better version
2015-11-18 21:37:31	yama	the spanish one is neatly formated
2015-11-18 21:37:35	JacolynDandreano	Nah don't worry about it
2015-11-18 21:37:44	JacolynDandreano	ugh I so wish I read Spanish
2015-11-18 21:37:55	yama	also, have they mentioned the main character's name yet?
2015-11-18 21:37:57	JacolynDandreano	then you and I wouldn't even be writing in English rn
2015-11-18 21:38:05	JacolynDandreano	I don't think they have yet
2015-11-18 21:38:23	JacolynDandreano	perhaps I will see him more Asian-like when they do
2015-11-18 21:38:42	JacolynDandreano	right now he is a mix between Asian and white in my head
2015-11-18 21:38:46	JacolynDandreano	but very cute
2015-11-18 21:38:51	yama	i imagine him in your mind suddenly turning asian :p
2015-11-18 21:39:03	JacolynDandreano	Rolled up sleeves, nice forearms
2015-11-18 21:39:13	yama	i imagine him skinny and extremely generic
2015-11-18 21:39:25	yama	well you would imagine that :p
2015-11-18 21:39:28	JacolynDandreano	Yes I imagine him rather thin too
2015-11-18 21:40:51	JacolynDandreano	I want to slap his wife
2015-11-18 21:41:13	yama	hahah
2015-11-18 21:41:17	yama	what is she doing
2015-11-18 21:41:27	yama	that argument felt very real to me
2015-11-18 21:41:52	JacolynDandreano	Complained about tissues and stuff and is now brooding and isn't even responding to his idea of a rest and then pizza
2015-11-18 21:42:01	JacolynDandreano	id snap out of it right away for that
2015-11-18 21:42:13	yama	haha i thought the same thing
2015-11-18 21:43:08	JacolynDandreano	:D
2015-11-18 21:46:11	JacolynDandreano	Are you going to play piano now
2015-11-18 21:47:18	yama	yes ty for reminding me
2015-11-18 21:47:30	JacolynDandreano	Ok. I'll leave fb then
2015-11-18 21:47:53	yama	ok, finish c3 by the time i return
2015-11-18 21:48:06	JacolynDandreano	Lol maybe chapter two
2015-11-18 21:48:13	JacolynDandreano	how will I know when u return tho
2015-11-18 21:48:16	yama	DO IT
2015-11-18 21:48:23	yama	you will sense it
2015-11-18 21:48:35	JacolynDandreano	Ugh ok I'll be back in an hour or two then
2015-11-18 22:18:43	JacolynDandreano	I finished chapter 3. I feel like such a slow reader
2015-11-18 22:19:07	JacolynDandreano	I guess you are not back yet, so I will start chapter 4 now. Ttyl
2015-11-18 22:43:17	yama	im back
2015-11-18 22:43:35	yama	i don't read fast
2015-11-18 22:56:22	JacolynDandreano	Faster than me you do
2015-11-18 22:56:34	JacolynDandreano	i just finished chapter 4
2015-11-18 22:57:04	yama	i barely read today :/
2015-11-18 22:57:13	yama	how are you finding it tho?
2015-11-18 22:58:27	JacolynDandreano	Easy to read, intriguing.
2015-11-18 22:58:42	JacolynDandreano	You?
2015-11-18 22:59:06	yama	same, but also kind of subtly poetic
2015-11-18 22:59:31	JacolynDandreano	yes, I agree. I like how you phrased that
2015-11-18 22:59:38	yama	not so much in the writing style like mccarthy (tho that could be there, but lost in translation), but like i said earlier in the little things he describes
2015-11-18 23:00:08	JacolynDandreano	Yes in the details
2015-11-18 23:00:19	yama	i really liked that part in chapter 2 about never being able to fully know a person, i've had those thoughts before
2015-11-18 23:00:27	JacolynDandreano	I wonder if the cat IS the brother
2015-11-18 23:00:30	yama	haha
2015-11-18 23:00:48	yama	at one point i was thinking the teen girl was the cat turned into a person or something
2015-11-18 23:02:08	JacolynDandreano	I have had the thoughts too about not knowing a person, but more so about ppl not ever knowing me.
2015-11-18 23:03:10	JacolynDandreano	Also, he made it sound negative, like it worries him. But I've always seen that as a positive thing. You will always be intrigued, always learn new things about the people you love
2015-11-18 23:04:33	yama	but no matter what you do you can't fully know the person you most love, it is kinda scary
2015-11-18 23:04:55	yama	also it was prompted by that earlier argument so it makes sense that he'd see it in a negative light
2015-11-18 23:05:00	JacolynDandreano	Well I think there are brief moments in time where you can connect incredibly deeply with someone over the smallest thing. So briefly that you don't realize you are "experiencing" them fully for just a moment.
2015-11-18 23:05:08	JacolynDandreano	But that's just my opinion
2015-11-18 23:05:58	yama	yes, but it's not the same as knowing
2015-11-18 23:06:04	JacolynDandreano	and I feel like the connection is so visceral that you can't analyze or grasp the knowledge of the person behind it, just that you are knowing them in an unexpected way at an unexpected time
2015-11-18 23:06:27	JacolynDandreano	But you wouldn't be able to describe it to yourself
2015-11-18 23:07:46	JacolynDandreano	Anyway I don't see it scary at all. As I quiet person, I particularly like to observe people. It is nice to know that there are always new things to discover about someone
2015-11-18 23:07:56	yama	yes but that connection is a connection to a part of someone and even to a moment, not to the whole
2015-11-18 23:08:08	yama	well, there can be hurtful and scary things to discover
2015-11-18 23:08:28	JacolynDandreano	Yes sure. But being hurt doesn't scare me I guess
2015-11-18 23:10:12	yama	that's weird :p
2015-11-18 23:10:27	JacolynDandreano	:( fine
2015-11-18 23:15:06	JacolynDandreano	Are u reading
2015-11-18 23:15:49	yama	im chatting with oberdong
2015-11-18 23:16:00	yama	and watching a stream on the background
2015-11-18 23:16:30	JacolynDandreano	Are u guys talking about me
2015-11-18 23:16:39	yama	no
2015-11-18 23:16:43	yama	about other grills
2015-11-18 23:17:15	JacolynDandreano	What?! You guys never tell me stuff about other girls
2015-11-18 23:17:18	JacolynDandreano	tell ME

2015-11-18 23:19:35	yama	no, when im walking home
2015-11-18 23:19:49	yama	likely ill see her again
2015-11-18 23:20:02	yama	maybe she's coming home from her work or something, in the opposite direction
2015-11-18 23:20:57	JacolynDandreano	What does she look like? Would she recognize u
2015-11-18 23:21:12	yama	she was one of the prettiest girls in my class
2015-11-18 23:21:34	yama	and she's still looks very attractive
2015-11-18 23:21:47	yama	and idk, i don't think so, i don't tihnk im memorable
2015-11-18 23:21:48	JacolynDandreano	Describe
2015-11-18 23:22:31	yama	she seems to have blondish, sort of curvish hair, which im not a fan of, but naturally she had brown reddish hair
2015-11-18 23:23:00	JacolynDandreano	Curvish?
2015-11-18 23:23:03	yama	um, thin nose
2015-11-18 23:23:14	yama	curvy at the ends
2015-11-18 23:23:22	JacolynDandreano	Lol u observed her nose
2015-11-18 23:24:05	yama	she was looking at the ground so i stared at her without fear that she'd look back :p
2015-11-18 23:24:14	yama	and then i turned when she was behind me
2015-11-18 23:24:47	JacolynDandreano	So u watched her butt
2015-11-18 23:25:03	JacolynDandreano	do u know that girls can sometimes sense when a guy is doing that
2015-11-18 23:25:05	JacolynDandreano	imo
2015-11-18 23:25:14	yama	yes, magic
2015-11-18 23:25:32	JacolynDandreano	Anyway go on
2015-11-18 23:25:39	JacolynDandreano	What else
2015-11-18 23:25:44	yama	that's it lol
2015-11-18 23:25:55	JacolynDandreano	What did she wear
2015-11-18 23:26:02	yama	we were on opposite sides of the street, walking on opposite directions
2015-11-18 23:26:03	JacolynDandreano	did she have a nice butt
2015-11-18 23:26:16	yama	a jacket, a backpack, jeans
2015-11-18 23:26:43	yama	she had a great butt in HS, and then she lost a lot of weight and all the guys were sad
2015-11-18 23:26:43	JacolynDandreano	Next time walk on the other side, nonchalantly say good evening and smile
2015-11-18 23:26:46	JacolynDandreano	as u pass
2015-11-18 23:27:03	yama	but she's all grown up now
2015-11-18 23:27:19	yama	and it was too dark and jeans were dark to judge butt
2015-11-18 23:27:29	yama	that'd be creeeeeeepy
2015-11-18 23:27:34	JacolynDandreano	No
2015-11-18 23:27:43	JacolynDandreano	Y
2015-11-18 23:28:17	yama	9pm, you're walking home, alone at night, guy crosses you and says m'lady
2015-11-18 23:28:21	yama	would you not be scared
2015-11-18 23:28:58	JacolynDandreano	Not if u are nonchalant and u aren't staring the whole time
2015-11-18 23:29:30	yama	some random dude saying hi and keeps walking?
2015-11-18 23:29:38	JacolynDandreano	of course u can also sAy the typical "excuse me do I know u from somewhere"
2015-11-18 23:30:01	JacolynDandreano	Are ppl not friendly when they walk past there?
2015-11-18 23:30:06	yama	im scared that she did recognize me and didnd't want to ackwnoledge it
2015-11-18 23:30:16	JacolynDandreano	Shut up you
2015-11-18 23:30:18	yama	strangers? no
2015-11-18 23:30:25	JacolynDandreano	Do what I say
2015-11-18 23:30:49	yama	i'd screw it up
2015-11-18 23:31:32	JacolynDandreano	Ugh fine. Well then just walk on the other side each night, pretend not to see her until the last second and then look up and smile or nod
2015-11-18 23:32:01	JacolynDandreano	Then after that happens a bunch of times, escalate to a "good evening"
2015-11-18 23:32:16	yama	she's probably like married by now
2015-11-18 23:32:36	JacolynDandreano	So look for ring
2015-11-18 23:32:48	yama	i'll try
2015-11-18 23:32:55	yama	if i actually do see her again
2015-11-18 23:32:59	yama	maybe it was a coincidence
2015-11-18 23:33:05	yama	maybe she'll change paths
2015-11-18 23:33:12	yama	also, you know what's weird
2015-11-18 23:33:12	JacolynDandreano	I'm way better at this than sankaku. What did sankaku say

2015-11-18 23:41:40	JacolynDandreano	That wasn't the deal we had
2015-11-18 23:41:43	JacolynDandreano	but fine
2015-11-18 23:41:49	JacolynDandreano	what should I read

2015-11-18 23:42:31	yama	i'll listen to the first words, and when i reach it, i will listen to it instead of reading it
2015-11-18 23:42:34	yama	or while reading it
2015-11-18 23:43:04	JacolynDandreano	ugh ok. I'll read the paragraph I am reading. Don't make fun of how I read tho :/

2015-11-18 23:44:06	JacolynDandreano	It is just a random paragraph it isn't even anything that will ruin the story
2015-11-18 23:45:00	JacolynDandreano	Actually I can't. Vocaroo is not supported on my phone
2015-11-18 23:45:10	JacolynDandreano	and fb messenger doesn't have recording here
2015-11-18 23:46:17	yama	-__-
2015-11-18 23:46:28	yama	just record with the phone normal app
2015-11-18 23:46:35	yama	and send it through db
2015-11-18 23:47:02	JacolynDandreano	Normal app?
2015-11-18 23:47:28	yama	the phone should have a default audio recording app
2015-11-18 23:47:31	yama	most do
2015-11-18 23:47:55	JacolynDandreano	Oh but it doesn't give me a link
2015-11-18 23:47:59	JacolynDandreano	ill try
2015-11-18 23:48:28	yama	no, you upload the file to dropbox
2015-11-18 23:48:31	yama	or somewhere
2015-11-18 23:48:34	JacolynDandreano	even tho u said that YOU were going to read in Spanish and I was going to read the English version when I figured it out
2015-11-18 23:48:59	yama	but it's better if each reads a section they liked
2015-11-18 23:56:53	JacolynDandreano	Well I liked this section but I didn't love it
2015-11-18 23:57:01	JacolynDandreano	anyway it sounds hilarious
2015-11-18 23:57:37	yama	where is it
2015-11-18 23:57:44	JacolynDandreano	because I had my face too close to my phone because I've never used it to record before so I didn't know how close i needed to be. And u can hear every breath I take
2015-11-18 23:57:52	JacolynDandreano	like a kid with asthma
2015-11-18 23:58:05	JacolynDandreano	Also I have a horrible reading voice

2015-11-19 00:11:23	yama	shush
2015-11-19 00:11:51	JacolynDandreano	Maybe it won't be in a format u can open
2015-11-19 00:12:14	JacolynDandreano	And then I'll just do a super short paragraph tomorrow instead on vocaroo
2015-11-19 00:13:06	JacolynDandreano	Did u get it
2015-11-19 00:13:07	JacolynDandreano	Did u get it
2015-11-19 00:14:33	yama	yes :)
2015-11-19 00:15:07	yama	i should have known your email would be something uncreative like part of your name and a number ;)
2015-11-19 00:15:11	JacolynDandreano	-.-
2015-11-19 00:15:29	JacolynDandreano	what does it show you? Just my email address? Or my phone number too

2015-11-19 00:15:58	yama	why would it show phone
2015-11-19 00:16:09	yama	and what do you think i'd do with your number :p
2015-11-19 00:16:47	JacolynDandreano	I dunno. Sometimes when emails are sent from phones I receive it with their number but that might be because of text
2015-11-19 00:17:31	yama	probably
2015-11-19 00:17:32	JacolynDandreano	and I thought u might sell the number to a company for cold sales calling
2015-11-19 00:17:38	JacolynDandreano	:P
2015-11-19 00:17:45	JacolynDandreano	Always a possibility
2015-11-19 00:17:47	yama	hot sales
2015-11-19 00:17:54	yama	yes that was my plan all along
2015-11-19 00:17:57	JacolynDandreano	Or that
2015-11-19 00:17:57	yama	since i met u
2015-11-19 00:18:03	JacolynDandreano	I knew it!

2015-11-19 00:19:37	yama	what about the wanted viagra ads
2015-11-19 00:19:51	JacolynDandreano	-.-

2015-11-19 00:30:04	JacolynDandreano	Yes well her landlord said she can't have pets
2015-11-19 00:30:13	JacolynDandreano	she is asking what to do with it
2015-11-19 00:30:15	yama	:(((
2015-11-19 00:30:26	yama	i wanna pet it
2015-11-19 00:30:34	JacolynDandreano	if it was me i would put out food but I don't know what they eat

2015-11-19 00:31:29	yama	depends on the cat too
2015-11-19 00:31:33	yama	chicken
2015-11-19 00:31:35	yama	milk
2015-11-19 00:31:44	yama	bread in milk
2015-11-19 00:31:51	JacolynDandreano	She thought milk was bad for cats
2015-11-19 00:31:56	JacolynDandreano	i suggested milk
2015-11-19 00:32:26	JacolynDandreano	She said he is under a bush. He's so desperate that he climbed on her windshield and car
2015-11-19 00:32:38	JacolynDandreano	I don't even like cats but I want that one
2015-11-19 00:33:19	yama	how can you not like cats :(
2015-11-19 00:33:27	JacolynDandreano	She feels so bad for it that she said she is almost crying
2015-11-19 00:33:36	JacolynDandreano	she doesn't know what to do
2015-11-19 00:33:52	JacolynDandreano	Well I like dogs better
2015-11-19 00:34:28	JacolynDandreano	and there is only one cat that I liked and I liked it because it was little and cuddly and wanted to be around me but not in a nagging way
2015-11-19 00:34:49	JacolynDandreano	It used to be abused so it wouldn't go near anyone. Very skittish
2015-11-19 00:35:25	JacolynDandreano	but every time I saw it I would kneel far away and put my hand slowly toward it. And it ran away less and less until it let me pet it one day
2015-11-19 00:35:39	JacolynDandreano	and then it started to come to me on its own every time I was around
2015-11-19 00:35:52	JacolynDandreano	and curl up next to me on the couch
2015-11-19 00:35:56	JacolynDandreano	So cute
2015-11-19 00:36:08	JacolynDandreano	anyway it was put down a few weeks ago

2015-11-19 00:37:17	JacolynDandreano	It had some type of tumor and started having violent seizures
2015-11-19 00:37:31	yama	i still miss my cat
2015-11-19 00:37:36	JacolynDandreano	it was maybe 14 or 15 Years old I think

2015-11-19 01:04:22	JacolynDandreano	there wasn't much she could do
2015-11-19 01:04:38	yama	:(
2015-11-19 01:05:13	JacolynDandreano	Anyway will you at least read in both Spanish and English? One language per passage so that I can guess from the Spanish
2015-11-19 01:05:33	yama	i'd have to switch between both versions
2015-11-19 01:05:43	yama	so there'd be some blank spaces
2015-11-19 01:05:51	JacolynDandreano	Ok that's fine
2015-11-19 01:06:00	JacolynDandreano	or send two recordings. I don't care
2015-11-19 01:06:24	yama	if i do that you won't be guessing tho, you'll just know which passage it is :p
2015-11-19 01:07:05	JacolynDandreano	What? No do two diff passages so that I won't know
2015-11-19 01:08:08	JacolynDandreano	Anyway I'm going to bed

2015-11-19 12:13:27	yama	yours sounded good btw, i barely heard the breathing
2015-11-19 12:13:39	JacolynDandreano	-.- i heard it. don't lie
2015-11-19 12:14:03	yama	i heard it with the phone's speaker tho
2015-11-19 12:14:11	yama	maybe i should hear it with headphones
2015-11-19 12:14:29	JacolynDandreano	no
2015-11-19 12:14:43	JacolynDandreano	pls dont relisten lol
2015-11-19 12:16:10	yama	i will when this rain stops
2015-11-19 12:16:14	yama	cause it won't let me hear a thing
2015-11-19 12:18:13	JacolynDandreano	no germán :(
2015-11-19 12:19:09	JacolynDandreano	also yay for rain
2015-11-19 12:19:09	yama	yes jacolyn :)
2015-11-19 12:19:11	JacolynDandreano	lucky you
2015-11-19 12:19:15	JacolynDandreano	you get to be home all day
2015-11-19 12:19:20	JacolynDandreano	ugh, don't listen to it
2015-11-19 12:19:23	JacolynDandreano	once is enough
2015-11-19 12:19:24	yama	i was hoping to go out but /shrug
2015-11-19 12:19:29	yama	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2015-11-19 12:19:39	JacolynDandreano	and you don't need to listen extra hard for my breathing
2015-11-19 12:19:53	JacolynDandreano	my sister just sent an update on the cat btw
2015-11-19 12:19:54	yama	i actually listened to it while i was reading that bit in spanish, it was weird
2015-11-19 12:19:57	yama	and??
2015-11-19 12:20:15	JacolynDandreano	weird how?
2015-11-19 12:21:09	JacolynDandreano	so, it somehow got inside the basement and was pushed against the locked door leading from the basement to her apartment. and it was meowing and scratching like crazy
2015-11-19 12:21:42	yama	because i was listening in english while reading in spanish
2015-11-19 12:21:53	yama	:((
2015-11-19 12:22:00	yama	am i gonna cry with the end of this story
2015-11-19 12:23:12	JacolynDandreano	and she is worried that she is going to get in trouble with her landlord, b/c she now knows why it keeps following her.  Apparently my other sister's uni roommate took it from the first sister's neighborhood and brought it back to their dorm room when the first sister drove them back.  the roommate got scolded for it so they brought the cat back to the neighborhood the next day.  so, that's why it was following her
2015-11-19 12:23:22	JacolynDandreano	and my sister didn't realize it was the same cat at first
2015-11-19 12:24:39	yama	just kill the landlord
2015-11-19 12:24:44	JacolynDandreano	i wish i knew what it was like to listen to one language and hear the translation in the other
2015-11-19 12:24:50	JacolynDandreano	read*
2015-11-19 12:25:04	JacolynDandreano	that's clearly the only logical solution
2015-11-19 12:25:21	yama	it's like having a live translation
2015-11-19 12:25:46	yama	also it relates to something i was gonna say in the recording
2015-11-19 12:25:49	yama	but i was too sleepy
2015-11-19 12:26:32	JacolynDandreano	which was what
2015-11-19 12:28:23	yama	when there's dialog i imagine them talking in japanese
2015-11-19 12:28:31	yama	like i "hear" in my head fake japanese
2015-11-19 12:28:32	yama	lol
2015-11-19 12:29:41	JacolynDandreano	really? interestinh
2015-11-19 12:29:59	JacolynDandreano	perhaps I'm too much of the stereotypical american
2015-11-19 12:30:35	JacolynDandreano	b/c i tend to see the narrator from an english-speaking white male's perspective.
2015-11-19 12:30:43	yama	well duh
2015-11-19 12:30:44	JacolynDandreano	tho I'm starting to picture him as asian
2015-11-19 12:30:52	yama	but this is clearly set in japan with japanese people
2015-11-19 12:30:57	JacolynDandreano	yes i know
2015-11-19 12:31:01	JacolynDandreano	but it isn't THAT clear
2015-11-19 12:31:09	JacolynDandreano	other than occasional names

2015-11-19 13:18:18	JacolynDandreano	i knew you mentioned "things" a few times, so I had a feeling it was that.  and then i thought you ended with "problema" or something similar but i wasnt sure.

2015-11-20 15:35:51	JacolynDandreano	well when you are a person who rarely listens to instrumentals, you have no frame of reference to know what is generic or not
2015-11-20 15:36:05	JacolynDandreano	so maybe i can appreciate the experience of listening to music more than you ;)
2015-11-20 15:37:04	JacolynDandreano	also what makes it generic
2015-11-20 15:37:26	JacolynDandreano	i like this pandora station a lot. maybe it is playing all generic pieces. i don't care tho
2015-11-20 15:39:18	yama	lol are you srs
2015-11-20 15:39:35	JacolynDandreano	for which part
2015-11-20 15:39:41	yama	i play piano and listen to classical music mostly, 90% of what i listen is instrumental
2015-11-20 15:39:55	JacolynDandreano	that's my point
2015-11-20 15:40:06	JacolynDandreano	I'm saying that I have no frame of reference
2015-11-20 15:40:10	JacolynDandreano	so i can appreciate it more
2015-11-20 15:40:18	JacolynDandreano	without the stigma of "generic"
2015-11-20 15:40:36	yama	i thought you were saying i was the one without reference
2015-11-20 15:40:38	JacolynDandreano	i know perfectly well that is 90% what you listen to :P
2015-11-20 15:40:38	JacolynDandreano	i know perfectly well that is 90% what you listen to :P
2015-11-20 15:40:47	JacolynDandreano	pls
2015-11-20 15:40:50	JacolynDandreano	PLS
2015-11-20 15:40:57	JacolynDandreano	i think i know you better than that by now
2015-11-20 15:42:15	yama	i find it generic because it's very "safe" music, it doesn't use much tension so the relaxed parts have no contrast
2015-11-20 15:43:00	yama	and the patterns that are used are very common
2015-11-20 15:43:10	yama	it sounds like improvised music kinda
2015-11-20 15:43:32	yama	or like an indie videogame soundtrack
2015-11-20 15:43:36	JacolynDandreano	so.... you don't like this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhT2a7YTUPw&index=30&list=PLu1HNBI6XydsyBbel_f8cxnnQVB394cY7

2015-11-20 15:45:49	yama	i find it better than the other one
2015-11-20 15:46:13	JacolynDandreano	what about the one after that in the playlist
2015-11-20 15:46:17	JacolynDandreano	this saddens me
2015-11-20 15:46:23	JacolynDandreano	you should like the same music as me
2015-11-20 15:47:30	yama	it's very hard to find comtemporary music that i truly like
2015-11-20 15:47:38	JacolynDandreano	boo
2015-11-20 15:47:48	yama	there's things i enjoy but it's not the same as truly loving
2015-11-20 15:48:01	yama	and the things i happen to like seem quite random
2015-11-20 15:48:30	JacolynDandreano	what about this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QYDYv94VPw&list=PLu1HNBI6XydsyBbel_f8cxnnQVB394cY7&index=74

2015-11-20 16:09:24	JacolynDandreano	well it seems like a song/video a pot smoker would like
2015-11-20 16:09:35	JacolynDandreano	I'm having a bad day
2015-11-20 16:09:37	JacolynDandreano	btw

2015-11-20 16:11:08	yama	also i like that song, but i don't think it's very good
2015-11-20 16:12:21	JacolynDandreano	no, i don't hang in other chans. only today is my visiting day.
2015-11-20 16:12:54	JacolynDandreano	i left bwf b/c no one was talking except sankaku and dragons and they were only there b/c i told them that i was there and they should join

2015-11-20 16:13:23	JacolynDandreano	well then maybe your departure made everyone sad
2015-11-20 16:13:27	JacolynDandreano	so they stopped talking
2015-11-20 16:13:39	yama	hahaha good joke
2015-11-20 16:13:58	JacolynDandreano	clearly it wasnt me that made them talk. since i was still there and people were quiet
2015-11-20 16:14:24	yama	flexv's summed it up like i said
2015-11-20 16:14:33	JacolynDandreano	also i don't really tell people in the chans anything special either. just the one chan i say when I'm having a bad day
2015-11-20 16:14:54	yama	what chan is that
2015-11-20 16:14:56	yama	and what do they do

2015-11-20 17:36:51	JacolynDandreano	ah so that is diff
2015-11-20 17:37:58	JacolynDandreano	i would cook it until is is crispy and then top it

2015-11-20 17:39:15	yama	i put it under the broiler at the end
2015-11-20 17:39:26	yama	and how long it's in it depends on which oven im using
2015-11-20 17:39:48	yama	because the one in my kitchen is hotter than my friend's or the one in the back of the house
2015-11-20 17:39:50	JacolynDandreano	oooohhh
2015-11-20 17:40:07	JacolynDandreano	is pancetta expensive there
2015-11-20 17:40:15	yama	maybe someday i'll make a sort of brick oven
2015-11-20 17:40:21	yama	relatively, yes
2015-11-20 17:41:01	yama	so just tomato and basil?
2015-11-20 17:42:13	JacolynDandreano	p much
2015-11-20 17:42:15	JacolynDandreano	and cheese
2015-11-20 17:42:26	JacolynDandreano	do it! you have your own yard right
2015-11-20 17:42:38	yama	maybe we'll do one of those and another with some type of meat
2015-11-20 17:42:42	yama	yes
2015-11-20 17:43:10	yama	but i'd add garlic to that
2015-11-20 17:43:24	JacolynDandreano	good
2015-11-20 17:43:30	JacolynDandreano	garlic is great
2015-11-20 17:44:21	yama	i need to plant some of the basil
2015-11-20 17:44:24	yama	do you know about that?
2015-11-20 17:44:40	JacolynDandreano	not really
2015-11-20 17:44:44	JacolynDandreano	i think it is easy enough tho
2015-11-20 17:44:47	JacolynDandreano	if you have the roots
2015-11-20 17:44:49	JacolynDandreano	?
2015-11-20 17:44:57	yama	i'll have to check
2015-11-20 17:47:31	JacolynDandreano	do you have a garden
2015-11-20 17:48:03	yama	what's the difference between a garden and a yard
2015-11-20 17:54:11	JacolynDandreano	a yard is mostly a patch of grass.  front yard would be a patch of grass in the front and back yard in the back :)
2015-11-20 17:54:35	JacolynDandreano	a garden is where you tend to specific plants you have planted
2015-11-20 17:55:02	yama	i have 2 yards and they have sort of gardens with flowers my mom plants but not a lot
2015-11-20 17:55:28	JacolynDandreano	oh. take a pic of the gardens next time
2015-11-20 17:55:47	JacolynDandreano	what do you mean you have two yards? grass in front and back?

2015-11-21 10:20:17	JacolynDandreano	I want nothing more than to be in bed rn
2015-11-21 10:20:20	JacolynDandreano	so much
2015-11-21 10:21:47	JacolynDandreano	did you listen to my recordings? I can't relisten to them now when I'm sober to see how bad it really is because I deleted them right away 😞
2015-11-21 10:22:57	yama	why can't you be in bed?
2015-11-21 10:22:57	--	[JacolynDandreano] is away: Offline
2015-11-21 10:23:06	yama	i did, and i made one :/
2015-11-21 10:24:59	JacolynDandreano	I have plans soon and won't be back until 12:30 or 1pm
2015-11-21 10:25:12	JacolynDandreano	Well send it already
2015-11-21 10:34:50	yama	ugh why do you make plans that go against your desires
2015-11-21 10:34:52	yama	i sent it
2015-11-21 10:34:58	yama	did you not get it?
2015-11-21 10:41:18	JacolynDandreano	Wait did you send it to my fb or email? I barely check my personal email. Only at work.
2015-11-21 10:41:51	JacolynDandreano	I make plans against my desires because my desires are not always good and I can't stay cooped up in my apartment like an old hermit forever lol
2015-11-21 10:42:45	JacolynDandreano	Also it isn't that I will not enjoy what I'm doing. Just that I feel really tired rn
2015-11-21 10:43:53	JacolynDandreano	last night was so much fun, but as an introvert I lose energy from being social and that mixed with gettin up early yesterday and also cleaning/shopping/cooking nonstop made me exhausted
2015-11-21 10:44:01	yama	email
2015-11-21 10:44:52	JacolynDandreano	Oh. I'll check in a little while
2015-11-21 10:44:52	JacolynDandreano	Oh. I'll check in a little while
2015-11-21 10:45:35	yama	noo just delete it
2015-11-21 10:55:57	yama	did u die
2015-11-21 12:18:17	JacolynDandreano	Yes
2015-11-21 12:18:29	JacolynDandreano	no I'm doing charity work
2015-11-21 12:18:29	JacolynDandreano	no I'm doing charity work
2015-11-21 13:18:16	yama	what kind of charity work
2015-11-21 14:00:13	JacolynDandreano	it is just some work with a charity that gives basic supplies (hygiene, school, toys...) to kids around the world
2015-11-21 14:15:24	JacolynDandreano	😃 I just listened to your recording. You made me smile
2015-11-21 14:26:16	JacolynDandreano	I didn't make eye contact with the old lady. Also I'm glad I didn't hear you talk about it sounding like it is out of a horror movie last night. Because I get scared so easily! I'm the type of person that watches horror movies with my blanket up to my cheeks, just below my eyes and I jump at the smallest thing lol
2015-11-21 14:26:57	JacolynDandreano	Also I wasn't drunk! If I was you would hear a lot more laughing
2015-11-21 14:27:12	JacolynDandreano	and I didn't break anything. I was pulling dishes out
2015-11-21 14:38:48	yama	i hope you deleted it already
2015-11-21 14:39:29	yama	how many dishes did you break :p
2015-11-21 14:41:23	JacolynDandreano	None 😠
2015-11-21 14:41:46	JacolynDandreano	I wasn't drunk :(
2015-11-21 14:58:31	JacolynDandreano	What are you doing today
2015-11-21 14:59:07	yama	piano lesson in a bit
2015-11-21 14:59:12	yama	and then nothing at all
2015-11-21 15:04:53	JacolynDandreano	I am taking 10min to straighten up my apartment and then lighting candles and my electric fireplace thing and wrapping up in my comforter and reading
2015-11-21 15:04:57	JacolynDandreano	im so excited
2015-11-21 15:06:43	yama	hah
2015-11-21 15:06:47	yama	candles
2015-11-21 15:07:00	yama	what if you fall asleep
2015-11-21 15:07:07	yama	and the place burns down
2015-11-21 15:07:10	JacolynDandreano	So what?
2015-11-21 15:07:20	JacolynDandreano	Nah I light candles all the time
2015-11-21 15:07:31	JacolynDandreano	i have 3-4 strategically placed
2015-11-21 15:07:45	yama	electric light is so mainstream :)
2015-11-21 15:07:51	yama	can i see them
2015-11-21 15:07:55	JacolynDandreano	plus I have a wax burner that plugs into an outlet.
2015-11-21 15:08:20	JacolynDandreano	See what? The candles? They aren't electric. Just regular candles
2015-11-21 15:08:29	JacolynDandreano	only the fireplace is electric
2015-11-21 15:08:31	yama	i know lol
2015-11-21 15:08:47	JacolynDandreano	Oh well they are just dumb candles but I will show you
2015-11-21 15:09:03	yama	ty
2015-11-21 15:09:03	JacolynDandreano	Lit or unlit?
2015-11-21 15:09:05	yama	lit
2015-11-21 15:09:14	yama	like before you're gonna sit down to read
2015-11-21 15:09:18	JacolynDandreano	Ok hold on. I will need to take several pics
2015-11-21 15:09:19	yama	when everythings set up
2015-11-21 15:09:29	JacolynDandreano	Ok I will wait a bit then
2015-11-21 15:10:57	yama	i wish i had a place to sit outside to read in the sun
2015-11-21 15:15:37	JacolynDandreano	I do kinda. Well I have a small deck with some basic chairs and some potted plants but the sun doesn't always hit it directly. Depends on time of day and how many leaves are on trees
2015-11-21 15:18:28	yama	i dont have a proper chair :/
2015-11-21 15:18:32	yama	or like a recliner
2015-11-21 15:18:50	yama	my lips feel so dry even tho i've been drinking lots of water
2015-11-21 15:35:47	JacolynDandreano	What do you sit in?
2015-11-21 15:35:54	JacolynDandreano	Use chapstick
2015-11-21 15:42:33	yama	there's a bench but it's hard and not in a very nice spot
2015-11-21 15:42:37	yama	i don't think i have any
2015-11-21 16:05:44	JacolynDandreano	Use the blood of your enemies
2015-11-21 16:31:40	JacolynDandreano	Ok these pics are crap because poor camera plus poor lighting...

2015-11-21 16:37:12	yama	it's not even dark! what are the candles for :p
2015-11-21 16:37:15	yama	are they scented?
2015-11-21 16:37:41	yama	you have war and peace
2015-11-21 16:44:56	JacolynDandreano	Scented and also for ambiance. Also that is not war and peace. The spines of the "books" pull out to reveal little drawers. I thought it was a nice idea for a place to store some little items
2015-11-21 16:46:50	yama	you made me want to light one of mine now
2015-11-21 16:47:02	yama	oh :( i was gonna said we should read that next
2015-11-21 16:54:14	JacolynDandreano	We can! I just won't be reading that particular one lol

2015-11-21 17:22:23	JacolynDandreano	Haha that wink makes me unsure about if I should say yes
2015-11-21 17:22:39	JacolynDandreano	Show me the candle. You don't need to show me your whole room
2015-11-21 17:23:01	yama	the candle is covered in dust
2015-11-21 17:23:21	JacolynDandreano	Omg so dust it
2015-11-21 17:25:58	JacolynDandreano	I'm gonna go read in a min so hurry up

2015-11-21 19:42:16	--	[JacolynDandreano] is away: Offline
2015-11-21 19:46:15	JacolynDandreano	What was it from

2015-11-21 20:36:53	yama	she made them to take to her friend's house

2015-11-21 20:43:54	yama	dunno, talk, go out on walks, watch movies
2015-11-21 20:47:26	JacolynDandreano	Does she date? Also what chapter are you on in readinf
2015-11-21 20:51:19	JacolynDandreano	I want to talk about the brother for a sec but I dunno where u are in reading
2015-11-21 20:56:52	JacolynDandreano	Germán pls respond!
2015-11-21 20:56:55	JacolynDandreano	pls
2015-11-21 20:59:43	JacolynDandreano	Ugh I'm going to lose my thought
2015-11-21 21:36:23	JacolynDandreano	I'm just going to tell you everything I'm thinking without ruining any parts for you if you aren't ahead of me. 1) I'm starting to distrust the narrator more in the sense that he comes across a tad full of himself and I think he may have some less-than-great qualities that he might not acknowledge. 2) remember how I jokingly said that the brother is the cat?  Well I think the author is making some bigger connections
2015-11-21 21:36:23	JacolynDandreano	between the two based on the wording of some of the descriptions of the brother.
2015-11-21 21:36:37	JacolynDandreano	There was a third but I can't remember
2015-11-21 21:40:29	yama	no she doesn't date
2015-11-21 21:40:34	yama	im still on c6
2015-11-21 21:40:55	JacolynDandreano	Oh I just finished 6 two seconds ago
2015-11-21 21:42:05	yama	i thought you'd be on c10 by now
2015-11-21 21:45:34	JacolynDandreano	No. I went for a run! I barely read today
2015-11-21 21:45:41	JacolynDandreano	But I am now
2015-11-21 21:45:49	JacolynDandreano	I hope u read too
2015-11-21 21:46:10	yama	wat
2015-11-21 21:46:10	JacolynDandreano	Instead of playing video games
2015-11-21 21:46:20	yama	you set up candles n shit to go for a run?
2015-11-21 21:46:44	JacolynDandreano	Nah I read a little. But then I went for a run and then showered and ate dinner
2015-11-21 21:46:58	JacolynDandreano	and now I'm back on the couch in my blanket
2015-11-21 21:47:53	yama	and you'll read like 5 mins and go do something else probably
2015-11-21 21:48:34	JacolynDandreano	No
2015-11-21 21:48:47	JacolynDandreano	Geez chapter 7 is short
2015-11-21 21:48:52	JacolynDandreano	im almost at ch 8
2015-11-21 21:57:41	JacolynDandreano	Ugh what are you doing
2015-11-21 21:57:51	JacolynDandreano	im starting chapter 8 btw
2015-11-21 22:04:06	yama	i have a headache :/
2015-11-21 22:05:04	JacolynDandreano	Oh I'm sorry for bothering you. I hope you feel better
2015-11-21 22:06:09	yama	you're not bothering me
2015-11-21 22:06:15	yama	im just complaining :(
2015-11-21 22:07:19	JacolynDandreano	Maybe drink water and lie down
2015-11-21 22:07:46	JacolynDandreano	I'm timing my reading right now. I just read a full page in 1.75min
2015-11-21 22:08:11	yama	i read about 1 kindle page per minute
2015-11-21 22:08:37	JacolynDandreano	Ur way faster
2015-11-21 22:08:45	JacolynDandreano	i feel like I have ADD lately
2015-11-21 22:09:17	JacolynDandreano	i will read a paragraph or two and then realize that I wasn't paying much attention for the last 4 sentences so I will go back and reread
2015-11-21 22:09:49	yama	it's probably a shorter page than on a book
2015-11-21 22:10:37	JacolynDandreano	Depends on font size
2015-11-21 22:10:57	yama	yeah
2015-11-21 22:11:00	yama	i can modify it
2015-11-21 22:11:08	yama	i think it's the 3rd smallest size
2015-11-21 22:11:13	yama	no homo
2015-11-21 22:11:33	JacolynDandreano	:D I took it as homo despite your disclaimer
2015-11-21 22:12:05	yama	i see you like to take it as homo
2015-11-21 22:12:25	JacolynDandreano	oh ho ho
2015-11-21 22:13:43	yama	were there any more steamy scenes
2015-11-21 22:13:52	JacolynDandreano	No
2015-11-21 22:13:55	JacolynDandreano	not yet
2015-11-21 22:14:17	yama	aw
2015-11-21 22:14:39	JacolynDandreano	ye so disappointing
2015-11-21 22:18:09	yama	50 shades of bird
2015-11-21 22:19:54	JacolynDandreano	50 birds of grey
2015-11-21 22:19:54	JacolynDandreano	50 birds of grey
2015-11-21 22:24:21	yama	are you gonna make a recording today
2015-11-21 22:25:20	JacolynDandreano	No
2015-11-21 22:30:06	yama	whyy not
2015-11-21 22:30:36	JacolynDandreano	Here is an interesting observation. So the first page took me 1.75min but ten minutes overall took me 24min. So I must have slowed down
2015-11-21 22:30:56	JacolynDandreano	Because I don't like making recordings :/
2015-11-21 22:33:30	yama	it seemed like you had fun with the ones last night
2015-11-21 22:33:38	yama	i didn't even have to ask for them :)
2015-11-21 22:39:05	JacolynDandreano	Haha yeah it wasn't bad :)
2015-11-21 22:39:22	JacolynDandreano	I'm starting 9 btw
2015-11-21 22:41:27	yama	read slower
2015-11-21 22:41:40	yama	so i should hope that you get drunk more often?
2015-11-21 22:42:06	JacolynDandreano	:) do you like drunk me better than sober me
2015-11-21 22:42:22	JacolynDandreano	I think I tend to sound the same buzzed or not
2015-11-21 22:42:32	JacolynDandreano	it is my face that looks different
2015-11-21 22:42:45	JacolynDandreano	But of course I can't know for sure
2015-11-21 22:42:55	JacolynDandreano	because my analysis happens when I'm buzzed
2015-11-21 22:42:59	JacolynDandreano	Lol
2015-11-21 22:43:07	yama	i liked that you sent them without asking
2015-11-21 22:43:21	yama	analysis?
2015-11-21 22:43:48	JacolynDandreano	Analysis of my speaking capabilities when buzzed
2015-11-21 22:43:52	JacolynDandreano	vs not
2015-11-21 22:45:07	yama	oh
2015-11-21 22:45:21	yama	you seemed more animated than on your other recordings
2015-11-21 22:47:35	JacolynDandreano	Hmm
2015-11-21 22:47:57	JacolynDandreano	yes I suppose I do get a bit more um ...social?
2015-11-21 22:48:10	JacolynDandreano	I feel more comfortable talking to people
2015-11-21 22:48:27	JacolynDandreano	before the fear of sounding annoying jumps in
2015-11-21 22:48:37	JacolynDandreano	but I don't think I annoyed you last night
2015-11-21 22:48:41	JacolynDandreano	or anyone else
2015-11-21 22:49:01	JacolynDandreano	Also two pages into chapter 9 it gets steamy for a sec
2015-11-21 22:49:12	JacolynDandreano	p short tho
2015-11-21 23:06:20	yama	woah chris brown back on irc, why is everyone returning
2015-11-21 23:06:28	yama	so what was different last night?
2015-11-21 23:06:35	yama	why were you more confident instead of paranoid?

2015-11-21 23:08:37	JacolynDandreano	i started to get nervous that people would think I was drunk when I was talking to them at one point but I just ignored it and it went away

2015-11-21 23:15:34	yama	my lips are still dry
2015-11-21 23:15:45	JacolynDandreano	Lick them
2015-11-21 23:16:51	JacolynDandreano	There's one thing I don't like about this book so far
2015-11-21 23:16:58	yama	what
2015-11-21 23:17:17	yama	also, no matter what you're gonna finish it faster than me
2015-11-21 23:17:24	JacolynDandreano	the plot moves along a little but then it is interrupted by a long history about a character
2015-11-21 23:17:58	JacolynDandreano	I keep reading long stories about seemingly minor characters
2015-11-21 23:18:21	JacolynDandreano	Also, from experience, you and I both know that I will finish way after you
2015-11-21 23:18:27	JacolynDandreano	no homo
2015-11-21 23:18:46	JacolynDandreano	But for now it has sufficiently grabbed my attention
2015-11-21 23:18:50	yama	no, cause mine is longer
2015-11-21 23:18:52	yama	no homo
2015-11-21 23:19:04	JacolynDandreano	Lol are you sure it is tho
2015-11-21 23:19:30	yama	yes, i compared them in kindle
2015-11-21 23:19:41	yama	it's like 10% longer i think
2015-11-21 23:20:28	JacolynDandreano	:(
2015-11-21 23:21:03	JacolynDandreano	Anyway my phone is gonna die soon. See ya
2015-11-21 23:21:11	JacolynDandreano	Have a good night
2015-11-21 23:21:33	yama	jeez just charge it
2015-11-21 23:21:50	JacolynDandreano	I'm going to. But I won't be near it
2015-11-21 23:21:57	JacolynDandreano	sweet dreams
2015-11-21 23:22:54	yama	oh
2015-11-21 23:22:56	yama	ok
2015-11-21 23:22:58	yama	goodnight
2015-11-22 00:10:39	JacolynDandreano	Quick observation and then I'm going to bed... I get the feeling that the narrator is either lying to us or to himself in little ways. He keeps saying that he didn't want to do something but he does it anyway or that things that happen are meaningless but then he covers them up. He subtly strikes me as a liar.
2015-11-22 00:10:50	JacolynDandreano	Ok now that that is out. Good night for real
2015-11-22 16:31:39	JacolynDandreano	Uh why can't you read on your off days?
2015-11-22 16:31:53	JacolynDandreano	is this the time I finally finish a book before you?!
2015-11-22 16:32:07	JacolynDandreano	Also longer boots...

2015-11-22 18:33:12	JacolynDandreano	I'm going to read more in a bit
2015-11-22 18:33:34	JacolynDandreano	i wish you were at the same pace as me so that I can discuss what I read as I read it

2015-11-22 18:47:24	JacolynDandreano	i just lit candles
2015-11-22 18:47:29	JacolynDandreano	and grabbed my blanket
2015-11-22 18:47:37	JacolynDandreano	you must think I'm so boring
2015-11-22 18:47:45	yama	why
2015-11-22 18:48:02	JacolynDandreano	that I look forward to sitting on the couch and reading with candles every day
2015-11-22 18:48:13	JacolynDandreano	it is not a thrilling activity
2015-11-22 18:48:23	JacolynDandreano	and it is almost too predictable at this pt
2015-11-22 18:48:46	yama	but from what you tell me you don't even do it that often
2015-11-22 18:49:34	JacolynDandreano	Yeah
2015-11-22 18:49:47	JacolynDandreano	but it is something I always think about
2015-11-22 18:49:54	JacolynDandreano	i like cozy atmospheres
2015-11-22 18:50:31	yama	yeah
2015-11-22 18:50:39	yama	i wish i could make my room more cozy
2015-11-22 18:50:39	JacolynDandreano	and I like the sensual (not sexual but literally the senses) part of it all
2015-11-22 18:50:51	yama	lewd
2015-11-22 18:52:56	JacolynDandreano	-.- you know what I'm trying to say
2015-11-22 18:53:16	yama	yes

2015-11-22 18:53:37	yama	interior lighting i mean
2015-11-22 18:55:04	JacolynDandreano	What about it
2015-11-22 18:55:31	yama	dunno, i wish i could have proper lighting, i feel it makes a huge difference
2015-11-22 18:55:48	JacolynDandreano	It totally does
2015-11-22 18:55:55	JacolynDandreano	what would you change tho
2015-11-22 18:56:19	yama	well i'd have to change most of my room
2015-11-22 18:57:33	yama	i'd like some lights pointing at a shelf with books i have
2015-11-22 18:57:41	yama	i'd like to have some posters
2015-11-22 18:57:59	JacolynDandreano	It can't be that tough to make the changes
2015-11-22 18:58:22	yama	it'd cost money that i rather spend on other things
2015-11-22 19:00:56	JacolynDandreano	I feel like lighting is very important for ambiance tho
2015-11-22 19:01:07	JacolynDandreano	and you spend so much time in your room...
2015-11-22 19:01:36	yama	most of the time i use my bedside lamp at night
2015-11-22 19:01:58	JacolynDandreano	I don't have great natural lighting in my apartment but the candles and fireplace and warm-light lamps make up for it
2015-11-22 19:02:09	JacolynDandreano	Your kindle lights up right
2015-11-22 19:02:15	yama	yeah
2015-11-22 19:02:37	yama	most of the day i have my window open
2015-11-22 19:02:49	yama	it's 7pm and i haven't turned on any lights
2015-11-22 19:03:42	JacolynDandreano	Because of sunlight?
2015-11-22 19:04:01	yama	yeah

2015-11-22 19:05:56	JacolynDandreano	It is comfortable but can definitely be improved
2015-11-22 19:06:06	JacolynDandreano	Framed?
2015-11-22 19:06:33	yama	framing is really expensive i think
2015-11-22 19:08:06	JacolynDandreano	Make your own then
2015-11-22 19:08:17	JacolynDandreano	can you ever work extra hours?
2015-11-22 19:08:30	JacolynDandreano	are you looking for a better job?
2015-11-22 19:08:51	yama	hours don't matter, only what i sell in the day
2015-11-22 19:09:04	yama	im not but i should
2015-11-22 19:09:33	JacolynDandreano	Eventually you will need one i would guess

2015-11-22 19:11:08	JacolynDandreano	Bbl. watch ur movie now
2015-11-22 19:12:53	yama	it's too early to watch a movie

2015-11-22 19:36:48	yama	tell me in detail
2015-11-22 19:39:13	JacolynDandreano	I'll sneak up behind you and catch u off guard when ur sitting. I'll pull your hands behind u really fast and tie a rope around them and then I will put a book in front of you on the desk and push your head down close to it. And if you close your eyes I will read it to you and you will have no choice but to listen. And if you tried to hum or talk over it, I will tape ur mouth shut
2015-11-22 19:39:22	JacolynDandreano	So there is really no escaping it
2015-11-22 19:39:40	JacolynDandreano	you will finish no matter what
2015-11-22 19:41:34	yama	>you will finish no matter what
2015-11-22 19:41:54	JacolynDandreano	-.- the book
2015-11-22 19:41:55	yama	i think you're overestimating your ninja skills
2015-11-22 19:42:04	JacolynDandreano	Are u calling me fat
2015-11-22 19:42:08	yama	no
2015-11-22 19:42:11	yama	just clumsy
2015-11-22 19:42:22	JacolynDandreano	😮😮😮
2015-11-22 19:42:31	JacolynDandreano	I'm p sure my plan is flawless
2015-11-22 19:42:58	yama	i'll hear you coming but i won't do anything just so you think you got me
2015-11-22 19:44:43	JacolynDandreano	Lol why
2015-11-22 19:44:48	JacolynDandreano	i don't think so
2015-11-22 19:45:02	JacolynDandreano	I'll wait until you have a movie on
2015-11-22 19:45:32	JacolynDandreano	I'll befriend your mom secretly first so that she can tell me when you are watching a movie or listening to music
2015-11-22 19:45:54	JacolynDandreano	And then SURPRISE! I'm there and forcing u to read
2015-11-22 19:46:50	yama	and what will you do while i read?
2015-11-22 19:47:32	JacolynDandreano	Read over your shoulder and point things out to you
2015-11-22 19:48:18	yama	what if i get hungry
2015-11-22 19:48:54	JacolynDandreano	Then I will leave u tied up and bring you a snack and feed you. But only if you keep reading
2015-11-22 19:50:30	yama	what snack
2015-11-22 19:51:46	JacolynDandreano	Leftover from that dessert that I linked u
2015-11-22 19:51:55	JacolynDandreano	because that is what I have
2015-11-22 19:52:15	JacolynDandreano	meanwhile I'll eat pizza and empanadas
2015-11-22 19:52:47	yama	how can i make them if I'm tied up?
2015-11-22 19:53:35	JacolynDandreano	Well I will wait for a day when you have just put it in the oven. And I will take them for myself
2015-11-22 19:53:51	JacolynDandreano	And then I will get ice cream delivered
2015-11-22 19:54:07	yama	to feed me i hope
2015-11-22 19:54:22	JacolynDandreano	and you only get three licks per page you read so you will need to read fast
2015-11-22 19:54:27	yama	hahah
2015-11-22 19:54:49	JacolynDandreano	And then we will have finished the book in a timely fashion
2015-11-22 19:54:49	yama	so far it sounds like a fun night
2015-11-22 19:55:08	yama	i get to read, i get cake, ice cream, and your company
2015-11-22 19:55:16	JacolynDandreano	Lol how does being forced to sit at your desk and not move sound fun
2015-11-22 19:55:25	JacolynDandreano	you can't play a game or watch a movie
2015-11-22 19:55:45	JacolynDandreano	You can only get up to pee but you will need to do it without using your hands
2015-11-22 19:56:01	yama	...that's gonna be difficult
2015-11-22 19:56:13	JacolynDandreano	Yes but your mom can clean it uo
2015-11-22 19:56:15	JacolynDandreano	up
2015-11-22 19:56:23	yama	how would i open my flyer without my hands
2015-11-22 19:56:31	JacolynDandreano	Because I'll ask her and she will be my friend
2015-11-22 19:56:40	JacolynDandreano	....
2015-11-22 19:56:57	JacolynDandreano	I'd help obv
2015-11-22 19:57:03	yama	oo lala
2015-11-22 19:57:26	yama	see this just keeps sounding like a better idea
2015-11-22 19:57:46	JacolynDandreano	Or maybe I will make the rope loose enough for u to do a shoulder dislocate and do it yourself
2015-11-22 19:57:57	JacolynDandreano	so that u don't pee on my hand out of spite
2015-11-22 19:58:17	JacolynDandreano	Im such a genius
2015-11-22 19:58:27	JacolynDandreano	I have everything thought thru
2015-11-22 19:58:30	yama	my shoulder dislocates are very bad
2015-11-22 19:58:36	yama	i haven't done them in ages
2015-11-22 19:58:38	JacolynDandreano	I should write a book with this brain
2015-11-22 19:58:46	yama	so you'd pretty much have to untie me completely
2015-11-22 19:59:18	JacolynDandreano	Well no I'll make it adjustable but not adjustable from an outside person pulling on it
2015-11-22 19:59:35	JacolynDandreano	and once it loosens and you pee then I will tie it tight again
2015-11-22 19:59:37	yama	but it'd be like 2mts long
2015-11-22 19:59:47	JacolynDandreano	So
2015-11-22 20:00:29	yama	are you implying you can make sophisticated knots
2015-11-22 20:00:31	JacolynDandreano	I would still be holding the slack string so if you tried to do something I would just pull it and your hands would tighten again
2015-11-22 20:00:46	JacolynDandreano	Pls gorden this is the internet

2015-11-22 20:02:14	yama	then ye
2015-11-22 20:03:05	JacolynDandreano	Haha my plan is flawless
2015-11-22 20:03:41	yama	im looking forward to it
2015-11-22 20:03:47	yama	i will pretend im not enjoying it
2015-11-22 20:03:55	JacolynDandreano	I'm gonna have hot chocolate
2015-11-22 20:04:05	JacolynDandreano	i don't know why you think it will be fun
2015-11-22 20:04:16	JacolynDandreano	ill serve u vegetables instead of cake
2015-11-22 20:04:42	JacolynDandreano	and you will only get a bite of cake for every 5 pages u read
2015-11-22 20:05:49	yama	no i dont believe you
2015-11-22 20:06:04	JacolynDandreano	Don't believe what part
2015-11-22 20:06:15	JacolynDandreano	that I would have veggies?
2015-11-22 20:06:18	yama	yes
2015-11-22 20:06:52	JacolynDandreano	You'll be really sad to be eating celery when I'm eating your empanadas and an ice cream cone in front of you
2015-11-22 20:06:59	JacolynDandreano	right next to you actually
2015-11-22 20:07:08	JacolynDandreano	since I will be reading over ur shoulder
2015-11-22 20:07:32	JacolynDandreano	and you will smell the empanada two inches from your face but you won't be able to have it
2015-11-22 20:08:23	JacolynDandreano	And if you read too slow with the ice cream it will melt on you and will be sticky and I won't even wipe it off
2015-11-22 20:08:33	JacolynDandreano	for more motivation...
2015-11-22 20:08:47	JacolynDandreano	Wow I'm such a sadist
2015-11-22 20:09:05	yama	i thought you didn't like wasting food
2015-11-22 20:09:10	yama	specially ice cream
2015-11-22 20:09:13	JacolynDandreano	True
2015-11-22 20:09:15	JacolynDandreano	hmm
2015-11-22 20:09:29	JacolynDandreano	this is a predicament
2015-11-22 20:10:29	JacolynDandreano	Meh I'll eat the ice cream and you won't get any licks if you don't finish the page
2015-11-22 20:10:36	JacolynDandreano	so you will just be left with less
2015-11-22 20:10:43	JacolynDandreano	way better
2015-11-22 20:11:21	JacolynDandreano	I'm so cold. Ice cream doesn't even sound nice rn
2015-11-22 20:11:28	JacolynDandreano	is it warm there
2015-11-22 20:11:47	yama	yes
2015-11-22 20:11:52	yama	im in tshirt
2015-11-22 20:11:54	yama	and no shoes
2015-11-22 20:12:02	yama	there are very loud crickets
2015-11-22 20:12:42	JacolynDandreano	Oh I like that sound
2015-11-22 20:12:49	JacolynDandreano	it is calming to fall asleep to
2015-11-22 20:13:22	yama	it's not like chirp chipr crickets, it's like one continuous sound
2015-11-22 20:13:35	JacolynDandreano	I think I'd still like that
2015-11-22 20:13:50	yama	good
2015-11-22 20:13:53	yama	you'd fall asleep
2015-11-22 20:13:57	yama	i'd untie myself
2015-11-22 20:13:58	JacolynDandreano	i just realized something... I just spent so long talking to you that now neither of us was reading lol
2015-11-22 20:14:06	yama	and eat everything
2015-11-22 20:14:07	JacolynDandreano	fall asleep standing up?
2015-11-22 20:14:17	JacolynDandreano	No. See I ate it first
2015-11-22 20:14:19	yama	im sure you'd sit down
2015-11-22 20:14:23	yama	ah but
2015-11-22 20:14:32	yama	i put roofies in the empanadas
2015-11-22 20:16:14	JacolynDandreano	and then when I got tired i would just take a nap on your bed but I would put the long end of the rope tied to my waist so that you wouldn't be able to give your hands enough slack in the rope
2015-11-22 20:16:28	JacolynDandreano	Also you won't know when I am coming
2015-11-22 20:16:48	JacolynDandreano	are u going to roofie yourself every day for an indefinite amount of time
2015-11-22 20:17:00	yama	well my bed is a mess so you'll have to make it first
2015-11-22 20:17:07	yama	no, i'll have a backup set of empanadas
2015-11-22 20:17:41	JacolynDandreano	Well I'm fine with cleaning up a mess. I would do it really quick
2015-11-22 20:17:54	JacolynDandreano	or just push everything under your bed
2015-11-22 20:18:13	JacolynDandreano	Except blanket naturally
2015-11-22 20:18:22	JacolynDandreano	I have thought of everything
2015-11-22 20:18:41	yama	there's dust and spiderwebs under my bed
2015-11-22 20:19:14	JacolynDandreano	Then u should clean it now
2015-11-22 20:19:29	JacolynDandreano	so that ur stuff on the bed doesn't get dirty
2015-11-22 20:23:56	JacolynDandreano	Did you die? Or are you tired of hearing my plots against you
2015-11-22 20:24:02	yama	just tidy it jeez
2015-11-22 20:24:02	JacolynDandreano	i guess I'll go read
2015-11-22 20:24:06	yama	no i was reading about the elections
2015-11-22 20:24:11	yama	and thinking what to have for dinner
2015-11-22 20:24:23	JacolynDandreano	Empanadas ;)

2015-11-22 21:33:38	yama	holidays are like a month away
2015-11-22 21:34:04	JacolynDandreano	Thanksgiving is Thursday and I have plans for Black Friday this week
2015-11-22 21:34:32	yama	oh i forgot about that holiday, i didn't know it was so close to christmas
2015-11-22 21:34:40	yama	isn't black friday a commercial thing?
2015-11-22 21:35:05	yama	i guess that is pretty much a national religious holiday in the US :*)
2015-11-22 23:05:30	JacolynDandreano	Haha
2015-11-23 01:10:28	yama	not sure if you saw https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/3tw66j/one_year_progress_m26_combination_of_bodyweight/
2015-11-23 02:24:48	--	irc: disconnected from server
2015-11-23 13:28:48	JacolynDandreano	what are you doing? why are you quiet?
2015-11-23 13:28:52	JacolynDandreano	i hope you're reading
2015-11-23 13:29:18	yama	i read a bit
2015-11-23 13:29:18	--	[JacolynDandreano] is away: Offline
2015-11-23 13:29:23	yama	but i was eating and playing piano
2015-11-23 13:29:42	yama	last night i read until i dropped the kindle from my hands cause i fell asleep
2015-11-23 13:29:52	yama	luckily i was on my bed so it just fell on my lap
2015-11-23 13:30:49	JacolynDandreano	also, i didn't have a chance to say... black friday IS a commercial thing.  Ive only done shopping that day once.  But, a lot of businesses always have that day off along with thanksgiving, so my family usually does a full day of cutting down a christmas tree at a christmas tree farm and then decorating it and our home for christmas while watching national lampoons christmas vacation and eating cookies lol
2015-11-23 13:31:15	JacolynDandreano	so how far did you read?
2015-11-23 13:31:24	yama	oh
2015-11-23 13:31:39	yama	i don't think i'll even take out my tiny plastic christmas tree
2015-11-23 13:31:50	yama	i think chapter 8
2015-11-23 13:31:58	yama	the chapter where creta explains her backstory
2015-11-23 13:35:20	JacolynDandreano	why not? you don't like christmas?
2015-11-23 13:35:35	JacolynDandreano	oh. that chapter was pretty interesting i guess
2015-11-23 13:35:38	JacolynDandreano	pls read more
2015-11-23 13:35:43	JacolynDandreano	I'm reading this rn https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/06/03/tolstoy-confession/
2015-11-23 13:35:43		[ http://is.gd/3GRE2z ]
2015-11-23 13:36:39	yama	dunno i don't care much for tradition and symbols of it
2015-11-23 13:38:19	JacolynDandreano	I'm the very opposite
2015-11-23 13:38:23	JacolynDandreano	i love both :P
2015-11-23 13:38:38	JacolynDandreano	I've been awaiting the holiday season for months.
2015-11-23 13:38:48	yama	meh :p
2015-11-23 13:39:40	JacolynDandreano	:)
2015-11-23 14:59:33	yama	why are you so quiet
2015-11-23 15:00:38	JacolynDandreano	i was working and waiting for you to talk to me so that I'm not always initiating with you ;)
2015-11-23 15:01:44	yama	i had an idea
2015-11-23 15:01:59	yama	if you can do it maybe with the kindle
2015-11-23 15:02:24	yama	go to the beginning of each chapter and read the title of it, so we can know when you're missing a chapter
2015-11-23 15:02:30	yama	and i can sum it up for you when i read it
2015-11-23 15:05:04	JacolynDandreano	good idea
2015-11-23 15:05:54	JacolynDandreano	or you can translate the entire chapter to english for me. It would only take a few hours for the recording.  and id get to hear ALL of the book AND your accent :)
2015-11-23 15:06:17	yama	that would delay my reading even more
2015-11-23 15:06:22	JacolynDandreano	but anyway what if the things that are missing are lengthy portions WITHIN a chapter
2015-11-23 15:06:25	JacolynDandreano	:(
2015-11-23 15:06:50	yama	from what i read it's chapters
2015-11-23 15:07:04	yama	in fact i think you can get a list of them
2015-11-23 15:07:53	JacolynDandreano	this is what the Amazon review said... http://pastebin.com/44hq92mf
2015-11-23 15:08:59	JacolynDandreano	ok so I'm going to write down the chapter titles in the next few minutes and then maybe you can tell me which I'm missing...
2015-11-23 15:09:59	yama	read them in a recording :)
2015-11-23 15:10:04	JacolynDandreano	-.-
2015-11-23 15:10:41	JacolynDandreano	i won't. that would make it way harder for you anyway
2015-11-23 15:11:09	yama	fine then i will write the summaries down too
2015-11-23 15:11:22	JacolynDandreano	noooo
2015-11-23 15:11:28	JacolynDandreano	ugh fine i will record if i can
2015-11-23 15:12:33	JacolynDandreano	what if the titles are different but the chapter is the same
2015-11-23 15:13:34	JacolynDandreano	this is going to take me a while
2015-11-23 15:13:36	JacolynDandreano	hmm
2015-11-23 15:13:47	JacolynDandreano	ill try to look up the chapter titles on the english version
2015-11-23 15:13:50	JacolynDandreano	and read from there
2015-11-23 15:13:51	yama	uh idk
2015-11-23 15:15:11	JacolynDandreano	well i just found this http://www.uog.edu/sites/default/files/maynard_lost-chapters-wind-up-bird.pdf
2015-11-23 15:15:12		[ http://is.gd/TBK8SA ]
2015-11-23 15:15:21	JacolynDandreano	which basically says what is lost in translation lol
2015-11-23 15:17:09	JacolynDandreano	here is what I'm thinking... i think i should read the book straight through. and then when i am done, i should read the article i just linked you to find out what i missed
2015-11-23 15:18:16	JacolynDandreano	im so sad that i can't read spanish so that i can just read what you're reading. it is the language i am closest to learning. maybe i can use this as motivator to study the language again
2015-11-23 15:19:24	yama	do it!
2015-11-23 15:20:44	JacolynDandreano	do what? learn the language? or read the book through first and then the article?
2015-11-23 15:21:33	yama	both
2015-11-23 15:21:40	JacolynDandreano	lol
2015-11-23 15:21:40	JacolynDandreano	lol
2015-11-23 15:21:42	JacolynDandreano	maybe i will!
2015-11-23 15:21:52	yama	i mean my summaries would probably suck
2015-11-23 15:22:07	JacolynDandreano	well you should summaries too!
2015-11-23 15:24:27	JacolynDandreano	maybe i should listen to one of the beginner podcasts while i workout... http://www.fluentu.com/spanish/blog/spanish-podcasts/
2015-11-23 15:24:28		[ http://is.gd/qGm6lZ ]
2015-11-23 15:24:35	JacolynDandreano	i will need to think about this
2015-11-23 15:26:41	JacolynDandreano	i just realized i forgot to eat lunch!
2015-11-23 15:26:43	JacolynDandreano	yikes!
2015-11-23 15:51:13	JacolynDandreano	in january, ill be going back to trying to read more books that the 1001 Books to Read Before You Die list is reading.  If you don't want to read any of the ones they are reading for that month (they usually choose three plus a longer seasonal read), then i will read a book with you AND a book with them.  That is, if you still care to read with me....
2015-11-23 15:52:59	JacolynDandreano	i mention this because I'm about to vote for the seasonal reads, and I'm probably going to vote for: Anna Karenina, The Brothers Karamazov, Gone with the Wind, and David Copperfield...
2015-11-23 15:52:59	JacolynDandreano	i mention this because I'm about to vote for the seasonal reads, and I'm probably going to vote for: Anna Karenina, The Brothers Karamazov, Gone with the Wind, and David Copperfield...
2015-11-23 15:56:04	yama	i plan to read anna karenina
2015-11-23 15:56:08	yama	already read karamazov
2015-11-23 15:56:16	yama	cant say i care about gone with the wind
2015-11-23 15:56:23	yama	and not sure about copperfield
2015-11-23 16:02:17	JacolynDandreano	i don't care about gone with the wind either. but, i looked through all the books that have been voted on already, and id prefer that to win over some other books like Infinite Jest. So I'm going to try to push the vote to a book that i would prefer over them
2015-11-23 16:02:37	JacolynDandreano	i may go with bleak house over david copper field tho
2015-11-23 16:02:59	yama	i want to read infinite jest
2015-11-23 16:03:39	JacolynDandreano	also, the count is tied with anna karenina right now for most votes, so it may be one of the four reads next year. which would be funny because ill probably still be reading it in time to participate in the discussion questions :P
2015-11-23 16:03:57	JacolynDandreano	ugh do you want me to vote for infinite jest instead of gone with the wind then?
2015-11-23 16:04:07	JacolynDandreano	I've just heard it is REALLY REALLY long
2015-11-23 16:04:25	yama	im not gonna tell you what to vote, im just saying what's on my list :p
2015-11-23 16:06:24	JacolynDandreano	ugh well maybe you would want to read it with me then
2015-11-23 16:06:49	JacolynDandreano	are you still interested in reading the same books as me or would you rather just read separately
2015-11-23 16:13:52	yama	i am already reading other books separately, which i know you wouldn't want to read anyway
2015-11-23 16:14:18	JacolynDandreano	well so do you want to still read a book with me or not
2015-11-23 16:14:35	yama	yes
2015-11-23 16:15:01	JacolynDandreano	ok then i will vote for infinite jest
2015-11-23 16:15:11	JacolynDandreano	instead of gone with the windd
2015-11-23 16:15:27	JacolynDandreano	it is over 1000 pages tho
2015-11-23 16:16:28	yama	you don't have to read it if you don't want to :)
2015-11-23 16:17:19	JacolynDandreano	i mean it is on the list, so it is technically on my list of books i plan to read
2015-11-23 16:17:30	JacolynDandreano	it just wasnt my first choice
2015-11-23 16:17:43	JacolynDandreano	i hope anna karenina wins tho b/c i already have it on my bookshelf
2015-11-23 16:17:57	JacolynDandreano	and b/c you want to read it
2015-11-23 16:18:08	JacolynDandreano	i think it will win tho. it is in the lead right now
2015-11-23 16:18:14	JacolynDandreano	by at least 3 votes
2015-11-23 16:20:13	yama	isn't that really long too?
2015-11-23 16:20:30	JacolynDandreano	let me see
2015-11-23 16:20:49	yama	i'd have thought it is longer
2015-11-23 16:21:02	JacolynDandreano	it is less than 900 pages
2015-11-23 16:21:08	JacolynDandreano	infinite jest is 1000+
2015-11-23 16:21:22	JacolynDandreano	so it is like 2000 pages less
2015-11-23 16:21:22	JacolynDandreano	so it is like 2000 pages less
2015-11-23 16:21:22	JacolynDandreano	so it is like 2000 pages less
2015-11-23 16:25:10	yama	dat math
2015-11-23 16:25:27	JacolynDandreano	haha
2015-11-23 16:25:29	JacolynDandreano	meant 200
2015-11-23 16:25:35	JacolynDandreano	I'm doing too many things at once
2015-11-23 16:28:23	JacolynDandreano	i wish you weren't so quiet
2015-11-23 16:28:31	JacolynDandreano	i feel like I'm constantly forcing you to talk

2015-11-23 17:58:54	JacolynDandreano	you can't really see much anyway
2015-11-23 17:59:31	yama	wow i cant believe u didnt share with me :(
2015-11-23 17:59:41	JacolynDandreano	i didn't share with anyone
2015-11-23 17:59:45	JacolynDandreano	except helgi
2015-11-23 17:59:55	JacolynDandreano	and maybe lgfd and sankaku
2015-11-23 18:00:04	JacolynDandreano	anyway helgi said the angle is wrong
2015-11-23 18:00:09	yama	:(
2015-11-23 18:00:24	yama	i guess lfgd and sanka are more important than me
2015-11-23 18:00:40	JacolynDandreano	no
2015-11-23 18:00:51	JacolynDandreano	i don't share it with anyone unless they specifically ask
2015-11-23 18:01:05	JacolynDandreano	and i think they were talking about h2t
2015-11-23 18:01:07	yama	i dont believe u ;(
2015-11-23 18:01:08	JacolynDandreano	not sure tho
2015-11-23 18:01:18	JacolynDandreano	ARE YOU CALLING ME A LIAR
2015-11-23 18:01:32	yama	im calling u too nice to tell me the truth :)
2015-11-23 18:01:46	JacolynDandreano	no
2015-11-23 18:01:51	JacolynDandreano	i always tell the truth
2015-11-23 18:01:58	JacolynDandreano	i would just think of a nice way to say it
2015-11-23 18:01:59	JacolynDandreano	:)
2015-11-23 18:02:37	yama	what would be a nice way to say you like them more :p
2015-11-23 18:04:59	yama	see you can't do it!
2015-11-23 18:06:43	JacolynDandreano	There is no nice way to say that. Because it isn't true
2015-11-23 18:07:11	JacolynDandreano	Right now the only ppl I consistently talk to are you and those two. No one else talks to me much anymore
2015-11-23 18:07:17	JacolynDandreano	at least not often
2015-11-23 18:08:17	yama	that's a copout :)
2015-11-23 18:08:20	JacolynDandreano	It is funny that you think you are making great connections with people and then you realize that it is all just internet trickery. That being friends with people online can change in a moment
2015-11-23 18:09:06	yama	are you planning on disappearing
2015-11-23 18:09:08	JacolynDandreano	I've found it interesting to see who actually talks to me without me forcing conversation
2015-11-23 18:09:55	JacolynDandreano	And with the many people I talked to all day and every day on irc, only three people still seem to care to keep in contact with me
2015-11-23 18:10:22	yama	thats probably more than me
2015-11-23 18:10:40	JacolynDandreano	But you talked less
2015-11-23 18:11:17	yama	less than what
2015-11-23 18:11:23	JacolynDandreano	ppl who would PM me to vent whenever they had a problem don't seem to care to put in effort to keep in touch. I don't really care, but I have noted the observation
2015-11-23 18:11:30	JacolynDandreano	less than me I meant
2015-11-23 18:11:54	yama	that's only recently cause you read ahead on the book 
2015-11-23 18:14:11	JacolynDandreano	When you said "that's probably more than me" were you talking about how many people would care to keep in touch from irc?
2015-11-23 18:14:16	JacolynDandreano	if you left?
2015-11-23 18:14:19	yama	yea
2015-11-23 18:16:51	yama	i thought you talked to jokester and phi too anyway
2015-11-23 18:16:57	yama	and they were your favorites
2015-11-23 18:30:45	JacolynDandreano	I've talked to phi one day since I left I think. And jokester maybe 3-4x. And jokester only because I initiated it in the first place
2015-11-23 18:30:45	JacolynDandreano	I've talked to phi one day since I left I think. And jokester maybe 3-4x. And jokester only because I initiated it in the first place
2015-11-23 18:30:45	JacolynDandreano	I've talked to phi one day since I left I think. And jokester maybe 3-4x. And jokester only because I initiated it in the first place
2015-11-23 18:31:20	JacolynDandreano	Anyway I still like them. But they now fall into the category of people that have moved on I guess
2015-11-23 18:31:42	yama	oh
2015-11-23 18:32:15	yama	i think the only way i'd stop talking to you is if you told me to stop :p
2015-11-23 18:32:25	JacolynDandreano	im not faulting anyone for doing it, because I didn't expect my friendship with them to last forever. I guess it made the nature of online friendships more real to me. That they are more fragile than they seem
2015-11-23 18:32:57	JacolynDandreano	Lol well thank you for talking to me. I actually appreciate it a lot <3
2015-11-23 18:33:02	yama	it has happened a lot irl to me too tho
2015-11-23 18:33:32	JacolynDandreano	Well irl friendships fade too. But not as quickly in my experience
2015-11-23 18:33:47	JacolynDandreano	people irl usually attempt to try for a few weeks at least
2015-11-23 18:33:59	JacolynDandreano	sometimes even months if they are good friends
2015-11-23 18:34:19	JacolynDandreano	unless they quit being my friend because of a falling out or something
2015-11-23 18:35:11	yama	yeah i guess im thinking of true, really good friends
2015-11-23 18:35:48	JacolynDandreano	Your good friends dump you right away?
2015-11-23 18:36:01	JacolynDandreano	true friends put in effort I think
2015-11-23 18:36:20	yama	i mean that true friends are rare
2015-11-23 18:36:33	JacolynDandreano	which makes me think I'm not a true friend to anyone irl. Unless you count family
2015-11-23 18:36:45	yama	and the rest are like, if im in the same room we talk
2015-11-23 18:36:47	JacolynDandreano	Oh yes I suppose you're right
2015-11-23 18:37:04	yama	but we wouldnt hang out outside, kinda like doing a course that lasts a few months
2015-11-23 18:37:25	yama	i'd imagine not many people in irc would want to hangout with me irl
2015-11-23 18:37:46	JacolynDandreano	I have always been the type to have one or two really good friends and then a bunch of people that I would call friends but who feel more like acquaintances to me
2015-11-23 18:38:11	yama	well, same with me minus the acquaintaces cause i dont go out
2015-11-23 18:38:27	JacolynDandreano	I think if anyone from irc knew what I was like they wouldn't want to hang out with me lol
2015-11-23 18:38:41	yama	dont be silly
2015-11-23 18:39:29	JacolynDandreano	I'm not. I'm being serious. But it is ok.
2015-11-23 18:40:29	JacolynDandreano	I'm a bad friend anyway irl
2015-11-23 18:41:07	yama	well i guess it's different for you having so many family members and appointments and a husband :p
2015-11-23 18:41:09	JacolynDandreano	I'm surprised other girls still want to text or hang out
2015-11-23 18:41:40	JacolynDandreano	Different how? Meaning people are always around and I have a good support system?
2015-11-23 18:42:10	yama	meaning you wouldn't have much time
2015-11-23 18:42:52	yama	unless it was like a one time group meetup
2015-11-23 18:43:40	JacolynDandreano	Yeah I'm p busy I guess. Once I'm out of work anyway. Not going to the gym has def given me more alone time too which is nice
2015-11-23 18:48:22	yama	i'd have time but im too awkward for anyone to want to hangout with me
2015-11-23 18:52:37	JacolynDandreano	Doubt it
2015-11-23 18:52:55	yama	why
2015-11-23 18:54:41	JacolynDandreano	Awkwardness is only present if all participating individuals find the behavior awkward. I have a few people in my life that would feel perfectly content hanging out with me without either of us feeling pressure to make conversation beyond a natural flow. Therefore it is not awkward to those people or me. But some other people are not happy with that and therefore make it awkward
2015-11-23 18:54:49	JacolynDandreano	IMO
2015-11-23 18:55:15	yama	im just too selfconscious sometimes
2015-11-23 18:55:18	yama	specially at first
2015-11-23 18:55:26	yama	it takes me time to be comfortable
2015-11-23 18:55:34	yama	it's probably why i suck at dating
2015-11-23 18:56:10	JacolynDandreano	I wonder if you would feel that way with me
2015-11-23 18:56:17	JacolynDandreano	if we ever met
2015-11-23 18:57:03	yama	probably cause i'd be scared of disappointing you
2015-11-23 18:57:07	yama	tho it probably wont happen
2015-11-23 18:57:48	JacolynDandreano	Anyway most of my friends tell me I'm really intimidating when they first meet me so it takes a little while to befriend me
2015-11-23 18:57:57	JacolynDandreano	so you'd probably be afraid of me too
2015-11-23 18:58:27	yama	intimidating how
2015-11-23 18:58:34	yama	are these male friends or female
2015-11-23 18:58:40	JacolynDandreano	It takes me a long time to warm up to people too btw
2015-11-23 18:58:46	JacolynDandreano	Female friends
2015-11-23 18:59:16	yama	hmmm no clue then
2015-11-23 19:01:44	JacolynDandreano	I think my mannerisms give off an idea that I'm very confident so they expect me to be very talkative. But I'm quiet. I'm confident in the sense that I'm not shy or timid. So the fact that I look confident but don't make much small talk makes people think I'm just a bitch until they realize that Im really loving and laid back and totally enjoy all types of people
2015-11-23 19:01:53	JacolynDandreano	That's my best guess
2015-11-23 19:02:26	yama	you used to say you were shy
2015-11-23 19:02:32	JacolynDandreano	But I've had lots of girls call me intimidating. Even when I was sitting at the Friendsgiving meal last week they said that they were scared to talk to me at the beginning
2015-11-23 19:02:32	JacolynDandreano	But I've had lots of girls call me intimidating. Even when I was sitting at the Friendsgiving meal last week they said that they were scared to talk to me at the beginning
2015-11-23 19:03:06	yama	maybe they just felt jealous
2015-11-23 19:03:49	JacolynDandreano	I say shy because it is easier to use that word than to try to explain that I am not afraid of people but I take a while to be comfortable and I have anti-social behavior in the sense that I enjoy alone time but that it doesn't mean I will dislike or turn down spending time with other people
2015-11-23 19:04:09	JacolynDandreano	Anyway they aren't jealous
2015-11-23 19:04:25	yama	maybe they are when they first meet you
2015-11-23 19:04:27	JacolynDandreano	i just appear to be mean or cold I think. Also I have rbf
2015-11-23 19:04:37	JacolynDandreano	Nah that isn't it
2015-11-23 21:42:50	JacolynDandreano	do you think this is a fair thing to say about myself? http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/3tyefo/are_there_any_girls_that_do_bodyweight_fitness/cxasu1w

2015-11-23 23:05:22	JacolynDandreano	I always need a blanket. When it is hot I have the sheet on me and then I wrap my arms and legs around the blanket
2015-11-23 23:05:31	JacolynDandreano	It can't be foiled
2015-11-23 23:21:05	yama	oh i thought you didn't reply

2015-11-23 23:21:50	yama	that will ruin yours
2015-11-23 23:21:53	yama	.......

2015-11-25 14:22:00	JacolynDandreano	she didn't go into details b/c her husband wanted to leave

2015-11-25 14:34:36	JacolynDandreano	b/c the immigrants were really poor so a lot of them were on the streets and couldn't pay for education

2015-11-25 18:48:38	JacolynDandreano	Take a shower. Because it feels good to relax after shower
2015-11-26 11:04:30	JacolynDandreano	I didn't. I went for a run. It was the only time I'll have to exercise. Don't you want me to be consistent and not get fatter
2015-11-26 11:04:51	yama	you're not fat
2015-11-26 11:04:51	--	[JacolynDandreano] is away: Offline
2015-11-26 11:05:06	yama	but sleeping enough is important to not getting fat, AS YOU ALREADY KNOW
2015-11-26 11:05:13	JacolynDandreano	Haha
2015-11-26 11:05:16	JacolynDandreano	oh man
2015-11-26 11:05:19	JacolynDandreano	ilu

2015-11-26 11:05:39	JacolynDandreano	I slept well tho!
2015-11-26 11:05:52	yama	im glad
2015-11-26 11:06:07	yama	but you should sleep 10 hours or so one night soon
2015-11-26 11:06:08	yama	to compensate
2015-11-26 11:06:29	JacolynDandreano	10 hours?! How does one even manage that?!
2015-11-26 11:06:40	yama	just keep sleeping
2015-11-26 11:07:02	yama	if you consistently don't get enough sleep, it accumulates
2015-11-26 11:08:17	JacolynDandreano	Do you not understand how sleep works? Lol. You can't just decide to go back to sleep at a certain point. Also I usually feel weird being in bed past 7 or 7:30. Like I'm missing the day :)
2015-11-26 11:08:47	yama	i do, that's why im telling you you're not sleeping enough :(
2015-11-26 11:09:36	yama	the day will be there, you're using the morning to give your body the rest it deserves to be healthy :]
2015-11-26 11:09:54	yama	and help it with stuff like, i don't know, maybe some injury on a shoulder
2015-11-26 11:11:29	JacolynDandreano	Lol way to throw that in there
2015-11-26 11:21:16	JacolynDandreano	What are you doing today

2015-11-26 11:41:25	JacolynDandreano	Is it the kind that is worth it to buy? Wasn't someone saying that there are some kinds that will bend quickly
2015-11-26 11:41:51	yama	yeah but i doubt i could reach that point very fast..
2015-11-26 11:45:23	JacolynDandreano	Does it come with weights?
2015-11-26 11:45:33	yama	no
2015-11-26 11:45:59	yama	but as marko is telling me, olympic bars are better because the weights are standardized
2015-11-26 11:51:55	yama	meh, the rack is really expensive

2015-11-28 15:34:56	JacolynDandreano	I'm in chapter one of part three.
2015-11-28 15:35:06	JacolynDandreano	I guess you aren't going to talk much today

2015-11-29 19:16:49	JacolynDandreano	No I just got home. It really burrowed into my legs and hand and fell asleep. And then when it woke up it saw my hair dangling above its head and watched it love when I moved my head a little and then out of nowhere it tried to grab it with both paws
2015-11-29 19:17:07	JacolynDandreano	Watched it move*
2015-11-29 20:07:46	JacolynDandreano	I totally wanted to

2015-11-30 21:02:08	yama	you said you weren't gonna be on social networks but you were on irc so i thought maybe it was your nice way of saying you got tired of me
2015-11-30 21:02:28	JacolynDandreano	I mean shorter responses in general. And mostly only talking when I initiate. Makes me feel like I'm annoying you
2015-11-30 21:03:08	yama	you don't annoy me
2015-11-30 21:03:21	yama	i have a big headache :(
2015-11-30 21:03:32	JacolynDandreano	No I don't tire of you. I didn't plan to be on irc today but I logged in really quick to add a quote and people started talking to me and I meant to stay a minute and ended up staying a while. Because I miss everyone and I am an addict
2015-11-30 21:03:42	JacolynDandreano	I have a headache too.
2015-11-30 21:06:17	yama	im eating dinner
2015-11-30 21:06:42	yama	what did you do at the gym
2015-11-30 21:08:16	yama	kumiko's letter made me sad
2015-11-30 21:10:25	JacolynDandreano	I did goblet squats and cable kickbacks and all the body line drills and ten minutes on the stepper cardio machine. And then I came home and did stepups and long lunge pulses
2015-11-30 21:10:29	JacolynDandreano	im so sore
2015-11-30 21:10:44	yama	nice
2015-11-30 21:11:23	yama	are you doing high reps or what?
2015-11-30 21:11:39	yama	how much weight
2015-11-30 21:11:45	JacolynDandreano	yeah it seems like her brother slept with her in her mind when he was sleeping with the Kano sister irl an that's why she got an abortion and wasn't sure what had happened. Do you get that impression too?
2015-11-30 21:11:52	JacolynDandreano	weight of what?
2015-11-30 21:12:16	JacolynDandreano	I do 3x8 of everything except the pulses. Those are 3x72 and really painful
2015-11-30 21:12:28	JacolynDandreano	but today is my first day of doing the pulses completely
2015-11-30 21:12:29	yama	no i didn't think that at all lol
2015-11-30 21:12:35	yama	goblet
2015-11-30 21:12:43	JacolynDandreano	What?! How could u not think that
2015-11-30 21:12:59	JacolynDandreano	goblet squats were 50lb. Weak, I know
2015-11-30 21:13:10	JacolynDandreano	I gotta take a shower bbl
2015-11-30 21:13:20	JacolynDandreano	But leave me messages while I'm gona
2015-11-30 21:13:23	JacolynDandreano	gone
2015-11-30 21:14:06	yama	idk there was no reference to kumiko or the brother having that "power"
2015-11-30 21:14:43	JacolynDandreano	Oh shit I almost said something and then realized I might ruin part of it for you
2015-11-30 21:15:04	JacolynDandreano	did you hear the Kano sister's story of how the brother raped her
2015-11-30 21:15:56	yama	uh i think, it wsn't in detail, she just mentioned
2015-11-30 21:15:58	yama	it
2015-11-30 21:16:00	JacolynDandreano	I have no idea where you are at in the book or the timeline of each chapter so I don't want to give anything away
2015-11-30 21:16:23	JacolynDandreano	Oh well hurry up and read. :( :( I want to discuss the rape
2015-11-30 21:16:31	JacolynDandreano	uh that sounded bad

2015-12-01 21:24:44	yama	a cute girl who came into the store, i just searched her on fb out of curiosity
2015-12-01 21:24:51	yama	you know, like a creep
2015-12-01 21:24:58	yama	what girl from the street?
2015-12-01 21:27:51	yama	btw i want to ask you somethin
2015-12-01 21:43:54	JacolynDandreano	Link?
2015-12-01 21:44:04	JacolynDandreano	the girl you went to school with
2015-12-01 21:44:20	JacolynDandreano	Ask away! I can't promise I will have the answer tho
2015-12-01 21:45:10	yama	ohh yeah i haven't seen her again
2015-12-01 21:45:25	yama	https://www.facebook.com/agos.bronzini?fref=ts
2015-12-01 21:52:44	JacolynDandreano	She is cute
2015-12-01 21:53:01	JacolynDandreano	Why not say hi
2015-12-01 21:53:19	yama	cause creepy
2015-12-01 22:15:05	JacolynDandreano	Fine
2015-12-01 22:15:16	JacolynDandreano	so what did u want to ask. I'll try to answer
2015-12-01 22:15:32	yama	i'll ask you when you're less busy
2015-12-01 22:18:44	JacolynDandreano	I'm less busy rn
2015-12-01 22:19:01	JacolynDandreano	im just going to read in a bit
2015-12-01 22:19:06	JacolynDandreano	that's it
2015-12-01 22:19:10	yama	idk if it makes sense asking u
2015-12-01 22:19:53	JacolynDandreano	Just do it
2015-12-01 22:20:11	JacolynDandreano	if it doesn't then ill just say "huh"
2015-12-01 22:21:10	yama	do you ever wear something that makes men tell you stuff out on the street
2015-12-01 22:21:16	yama	or whistle
2015-12-01 22:21:50	JacolynDandreano	Specifically for that purpose?
2015-12-01 22:22:03	yama	no
2015-12-01 22:23:49	JacolynDandreano	well I don't walk on the street much. But I suppose I get catcalled only occasionally. Last time it was a week or two ago when I ran. Not like every day when I was younger. And that happened wether or not I was wearing tighter or looser clothes. Less revealing or more revealing didn't matter
2015-12-01 22:23:51	JacolynDandreano	why do you ask
2015-12-01 22:25:50	yama	cause this woman who i see often on the train back, today was wearing tight jeans and a short shirt with her belly showing and she gets off on the same station as me and everyone started at her and whistled and shit
2015-12-01 22:26:01	yama	and i almost wanted to ask her if it doesn't bother her
2015-12-01 22:26:20	yama	out of curiosity
2015-12-01 22:28:57	JacolynDandreano	Well it never bothered me. I mean it isn't really a turn on to have people approach you like that, but it also doesn't make me mad. But from what i have read, a lot of women get really angry about it. My feeling is that if you wear something showing that much skin and you have a decent body, you should expect people won't be quiet all the time. And I think people that dress like that may just be looking for attention. Not
2015-12-01 22:28:57	JacolynDandreano	100% of the time, but most of the time
2015-12-01 22:29:41	JacolynDandreano	The only time it bothered me, I should add, is when it was someone really old. Because then it is really creepy
2015-12-01 22:30:04	JacolynDandreano	also it depends on how far the guy follows you too to depend on creepiness
2015-12-01 22:30:08	yama	they didn't approach her, they just say stuff and make noises lol
2015-12-01 22:30:27	JacolynDandreano	if he walks behind you for 5 min then it made me nervous
2015-12-01 22:30:59	yama	mostly, guys from the train 
2015-12-01 22:31:04	JacolynDandreano	Oh. Well a lot of girls would be angry. It didn't bother me much tho
2015-12-01 22:31:09	yama	like dogs who only bark when they're inside the house
2015-12-01 22:31:28	JacolynDandreano	Lol I take it you do not approve of this behavior..
2015-12-01 22:31:47	yama	but what i wonder is if when she's about to choose clothes she thinks of it or what
2015-12-01 22:31:52	yama	it's dumb
2015-12-01 22:32:01	yama	also
2015-12-01 22:32:12	yama	i "followed" her like 5 blocks
2015-12-01 22:32:22	yama	because that's my path home
2015-12-01 22:32:40	yama	but i was on the other side of the street

2015-12-01 23:01:59	yama	almost broke my keyboard
2015-12-01 23:02:14	yama	cause i felt a cockroach on my foot
2015-12-01 23:03:24	JacolynDandreano	Yikes
2015-12-01 23:03:39	JacolynDandreano	ive never seen one before
2015-12-01 23:03:41	JacolynDandreano	irl
2015-12-01 23:03:48	JacolynDandreano	but that would scare me
2015-12-01 23:04:00	yama	i dont understand how that can be possible
2015-12-01 23:04:12	yama	they're the thing i hate most in this world
2015-12-01 23:05:54	JacolynDandreano	I think they are more native to big cities. I don't live in a big city
2015-12-01 23:06:08	yama	i don't either
2015-12-01 23:06:10	JacolynDandreano	I get the occasional small spider. Those freak me out
2015-12-01 23:06:33	JacolynDandreano	Also sometimes there are stink bugs or lady bugs
2015-12-01 23:06:59	yama	im starting to seriously consider spending my savings on an AC instead of a trip :/
2015-12-01 23:06:59	JacolynDandreano	but usually no bugs. I spray stuff along the perimeter of the rooms that supposedly creates a barrier against bugs
2015-12-01 23:07:15	JacolynDandreano	Spend it on a cockroach exterminator
2015-12-01 23:07:29	JacolynDandreano	What trip btw
2015-12-01 23:07:36	yama	that won't deal with the heat
2015-12-01 23:07:41	yama	idk i want to go somewhere
2015-12-01 23:07:59	JacolynDandreano	You would rather have a cockroach than heat?
2015-12-01 23:08:15	yama	wut
2015-12-01 23:08:27	yama	having a cool room would mean less cockroaches
2015-12-01 23:08:33	yama	they come out when it's hot
2015-12-01 23:08:38	JacolynDandreano	Oh. Is that so?

2015-12-01 23:12:30	yama	no
2015-12-01 23:12:58	JacolynDandreano	Oh. Get AC then!
2015-12-01 23:13:23	yama	but it makes me sad that i've had a trip in mind for ages
2015-12-01 23:13:52	JacolynDandreano	Venezuela? :P
2015-12-01 23:14:05	yama	lol
2015-12-01 23:14:09	yama	too far
2015-12-01 23:15:06	JacolynDandreano	What trip?
2015-12-01 23:15:45	yama	idk probably somewhere within the country
2015-12-01 23:15:48	yama	or a nearby country
2015-12-01 23:16:14	JacolynDandreano	America is close
2015-12-01 23:16:44	yama	and really hard to get a visa 
2015-12-01 23:16:45	yama	i think
2015-12-01 23:17:46	JacolynDandreano	Oh. Yeah that's true prob
2015-12-01 23:18:08	yama	i dont know where i'd go there anyway
2015-12-01 23:19:15	JacolynDandreano	In Venezuela? Anywhere... To get grills
2015-12-01 23:19:45	yama	the us
2015-12-01 23:19:51	yama	if by america you meant the us
2015-12-01 23:20:17	yama	what if i went to venezuela and ran into the girl i used to chat with tho
2015-12-01 23:20:40	JacolynDandreano	Then u hug her
2015-12-01 23:21:13	JacolynDandreano	id say come here but I'd be sad if u came here because I wouldn't be able to visit prob
2015-12-01 23:21:24	JacolynDandreano	Also nothing to do here lol
2015-12-01 23:23:20	yama	yeah i better not go there then :p
2015-12-01 23:23:36	yama	im pretty sure that girl has a bf tho
2015-12-01 23:24:47	JacolynDandreano	I said hug. Not throw her against a wall and rip off all her clothes
2015-12-01 23:25:28	yama	lol
2015-12-01 23:25:43	yama	the thing is, either she'd want that, or she'd hate me and not want to see me at all
2015-12-01 23:26:08	JacolynDandreano	Well it is a 50/50 chance ... :P
2015-12-01 23:27:22	yama	she probably doesn't remember me
2015-12-01 23:28:10	JacolynDandreano	Then less of a reason for her to hate you and more of a reason to accept random sex in the alleyway
2015-12-01 23:30:19	yama	i dont think that's how a girl's mind works
2015-12-01 23:31:38	JacolynDandreano	No they all work like that. I know this fact
2015-12-01 23:32:07	yama	uhhhh so you've accepted random alley sex?
2015-12-01 23:32:53	JacolynDandreano	It has never happened
2015-12-01 23:32:53	JacolynDandreano	also I wouldn't
2015-12-01 23:32:53	JacolynDandreano	:P

2015-12-02 17:37:07	yama	idk how you do ice cream in the US
2015-12-02 17:37:33	yama	here there's like ice cream that comes on a wooden stick in a plastic wrap 
2015-12-02 17:37:54	yama	or ice cream that you buy packaged in the supermarket
2015-12-02 17:38:04	yama	and then there's from ice cream stores, which is the best by far
2015-12-02 17:39:10	yama	http://forum.wordreference.com/threads/helados-artesanales.1222926/
2015-12-02 17:40:19	JacolynDandreano	yes we have all those types here
2015-12-02 17:40:25	JacolynDandreano	but i meant to ask flavor
2015-12-02 17:40:39	yama	dunno, i haven't opened it yet
2015-12-02 17:40:50	yama	but how do you call that last type?
2015-12-02 17:40:59	JacolynDandreano	the wooden stick ones are usually called popsicles i think... b/c they are on popsicle sticks
2015-12-02 17:41:04	JacolynDandreano	oh um
2015-12-02 17:42:06	JacolynDandreano	im not sure we have a word for it
2015-12-02 17:42:22	JacolynDandreano	other than ice cream from an ice cream shop
2015-12-02 17:42:35	JacolynDandreano	let me see what some of the more famous ones call it
2015-12-02 17:42:35	JacolynDandreano	let me see what some of the more famous ones call it
2015-12-02 17:42:46	JacolynDandreano	i suppose some would call it gourmet ice cream
2015-12-02 17:43:07	yama	yeah
2015-12-02 17:43:59	JacolynDandreano	it is just ice cream lol
2015-12-02 17:44:08	yama	NO
2015-12-02 17:44:19	yama	obviously you don't take ice cream as seriously in the US
2015-12-02 17:44:57	JacolynDandreano	lol well i do!
2015-12-02 17:45:19	JacolynDandreano	ice cream was my favorite food before bacon and empanadas stole the top two spots
2015-12-02 17:45:57	JacolynDandreano	anyway i don't know if it is common to make ice cream like the coldstone creamery ^, but i really like the taste.
2015-12-02 17:46:03	yama	i think it's far to separate them into meals, ingredients and sweet stuff
2015-12-02 17:46:56	JacolynDandreano	well it is one of my fav desserts then i suppose
2015-12-02 17:49:09	yama	next time i have a date im gonna research for the best ice cream places in bs as

2015-12-03 14:01:34	JacolynDandreano	it could be from drinking coffee and my office is really really warm
2015-12-03 14:01:45	JacolynDandreano	but I'm always cold so it feels normal to me rn
2015-12-03 14:11:00	yama	pay no attention to my bed
2015-12-03 14:17:11	JacolynDandreano	omg
2015-12-03 14:17:14	JacolynDandreano	that looks so good
2015-12-03 14:17:20	JacolynDandreano	what is wrong with ur bed
2015-12-03 14:17:22	JacolynDandreano	i can barely see it
2015-12-03 14:17:25	yama	NOTHING
2015-12-03 14:17:27	yama	DONT LOOK
2015-12-03 14:17:35	yama	it tasted better than it looks
2015-12-03 14:17:45	yama	cause the chocolate ice cream was at the bottom of the cone
2015-12-03 14:17:51	yama	cause i like saving the best for last
2015-12-03 14:17:51	JacolynDandreano	lol no, now post a pic of the bed
2015-12-03 14:17:54	JacolynDandreano	i want to see
2015-12-03 14:17:56	yama	noooooooo
2015-12-03 14:17:59	yama	it's a mess
2015-12-03 14:18:00	JacolynDandreano	i do that too with ice cream!
2015-12-03 14:18:15	JacolynDandreano	well if there is junk on it then take it off and show me
2015-12-03 14:18:21	JacolynDandreano	i showed you my begging face...
2015-12-03 14:18:24	JacolynDandreano	and that is worse!
2015-12-03 14:18:32	yama	its not junk
2015-12-03 14:18:42	JacolynDandreano	what is it
2015-12-03 14:19:36	JacolynDandreano	whenever i get ice cream cones, i try to put chocolate chips and chocolate syrup in the bottom (after inspecting the tip of the cone to make sure there isn't a hole). then, i put ice cream on top of it.  that way i can surprise myself with the chocolate :P
2015-12-03 14:20:05	yama	i don't have those thigs
2015-12-03 14:20:07	JacolynDandreano	your bed is not as small as it sounds
2015-12-03 14:20:09	yama	things
2015-12-03 14:20:12	JacolynDandreano	which part do you sleep on
2015-12-03 14:20:20	yama	um all of it?
2015-12-03 14:20:23	yama	what do you mean
2015-12-03 14:20:31	JacolynDandreano	you just sprawl out on the whole thing
2015-12-03 14:20:32	JacolynDandreano	?
2015-12-03 14:20:41	yama	if i did that i'd hit the wall
2015-12-03 14:20:48	yama	and the other limbs would be off the bed
2015-12-03 14:20:56	yama	i'd take a pic if i could
2015-12-03 14:21:50	JacolynDandreano	i like when beds are pushed against the wall. if that was my bed, id probably lie on my side against the wall
2015-12-03 14:22:04	JacolynDandreano	and the rest of the bed would be unused lol
2015-12-03 14:22:04	JacolynDandreano	and the rest of the bed would be unused lol
2015-12-03 14:22:04	JacolynDandreano	and the rest of the bed would be unused lol
2015-12-03 14:22:10	yama	with your back against the wall?
2015-12-03 14:22:20	JacolynDandreano	yeah or even facing the wall
2015-12-03 14:22:29	yama	that's how i sleep
2015-12-03 14:22:32	JacolynDandreano	i change sides a fair amount
2015-12-03 14:22:41	yama	but with a pillow between me and the wall
2015-12-03 14:22:58	JacolynDandreano	with back against the pillow?
2015-12-03 14:23:04	JacolynDandreano	or is that the one you hug
2015-12-03 14:23:04	yama	no...
2015-12-03 14:23:06	yama	well, sometimes
2015-12-03 14:23:12	yama	i change sides too
2015-12-03 14:24:54	JacolynDandreano	the thing is tho that i think i would need to have back to wall. i don't like feeling my back exposed. it makes me think there is a murderer behind me
2015-12-03 14:25:24	yama	do u sleep with a tinfoil hat on
2015-12-03 14:25:54	yama	ill protect your back
2015-12-03 14:27:48	JacolynDandreano	lol
2015-12-03 14:28:02	JacolynDandreano	what if you are the murderer :O
2015-12-03 14:28:59	yama	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2015-12-03 14:29:01	JacolynDandreano	i don't get scared much at night anymore, but i used to. and one of the things that made me nervous was always not facing the door for some reason
2015-12-03 14:29:07	JacolynDandreano	so i got in the habit of it
2015-12-03 14:29:18	JacolynDandreano	of always making sure my back wasnt exposed
2015-12-03 14:29:51	yama	im pretty sure if you're asleep a murderer could get u no matter where you're facing
2015-12-03 14:34:21	JacolynDandreano	shhh
2015-12-03 14:34:28	JacolynDandreano	get out of here with your logic
2015-12-03 14:34:50	JacolynDandreano	it is lunch time now and i just remembered that i don't have lunch
2015-12-03 14:34:56	JacolynDandreano	:(
2015-12-03 14:37:04	yama	the ice cream on your cheeks should be enough
2015-12-03 14:37:35	JacolynDandreano	that's not how it works!
2015-12-03 14:37:46	JacolynDandreano	your skin doesn't just absorb food
2015-12-03 14:37:55	yama	just lick it!
2015-12-03 14:38:12	JacolynDandreano	otherwise id smear food on my skin
2015-12-03 14:38:20	JacolynDandreano	when i don't feel like eating
2015-12-03 14:38:35	yama	so never?
2015-12-03 14:40:01	JacolynDandreano	haha
2015-12-03 14:40:19	JacolynDandreano	well if i could absorb food with out the effort of chewing that would be nice
2015-12-03 14:40:23	JacolynDandreano	SOMETIMES
2015-12-03 14:40:37	yama	but just lick it
2015-12-03 14:41:25	JacolynDandreano	now that seems like work still
2015-12-03 14:41:39	JacolynDandreano	also licked skin feels weird when it dries
2015-12-03 14:41:47	JacolynDandreano	im not really a cat, germán
2015-12-03 14:41:50	yama	it's just gonna melt
2015-12-03 14:41:58	yama	:(
2015-12-03 14:43:46	JacolynDandreano	how do i lick my cheeks? lol
2015-12-03 14:44:02	yama	idk how long your tongue is
2015-12-03 14:47:15	JacolynDandreano	p long, but not THAT long
2015-12-03 14:47:33	JacolynDandreano	i can touch the tip of my nose with my tongue, but can't go farther
2015-12-03 14:48:15	yama	damn
2015-12-03 14:48:39	JacolynDandreano	yes, sorry. i don't have a lizard tongue
2015-12-03 14:48:46	yama	no, that's long
2015-12-03 14:49:04	yama	i can reach like half of my moustache
2015-12-03 14:49:13	JacolynDandreano	lol
2015-12-03 14:49:23	JacolynDandreano	then maybe I'm a freak :(
2015-12-03 14:49:25	yama	which i should cut
2015-12-03 14:49:30	yama	got ice cream all over it
2015-12-03 14:49:46	JacolynDandreano	and can't lick it off b/c short tongue
2015-12-03 14:50:10	yama	well then itll melt and itll dirty your clothes
2015-12-03 14:51:59	JacolynDandreano	i can wipe it off my cheeks then
2015-12-03 14:52:11	JacolynDandreano	how much of this are you putting on them anyway lol
2015-12-03 14:52:25	yama	1 teaspoon
2015-12-03 14:54:26	JacolynDandreano	that's a lot
2015-12-03 14:54:45	JacolynDandreano	and i feel like it would drip right away if you put them on both cheeks at the same time
2015-12-03 14:54:51	yama	fine ill just eat it
2015-12-03 14:54:56	JacolynDandreano	if it was one, id just lie very still
2015-12-03 14:55:02	JacolynDandreano	and keep it all on the one cheek
2015-12-03 14:58:25	JacolynDandreano	lol https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/3a/2b/06/3a2b0678e5177bb08178e183646efac0.jpg

2015-12-03 14:58:58	yama	lol
2015-12-03 14:59:01	yama	her face is all derp
2015-12-03 15:01:12	JacolynDandreano	rude
2015-12-03 15:01:15	JacolynDandreano	that is really me
2015-12-03 15:01:21	yama	no
2015-12-03 15:01:29	JacolynDandreano	all the other pics I've shared with you were from google
2015-12-03 15:01:39	yama	hahah
2015-12-03 15:01:53	yama	and hangouts?
2015-12-03 15:03:10	JacolynDandreano	i found the girl from google and paid her in cookies to sit and pretend to be me
2015-12-03 15:05:42	yama	so that was her voice too?
2015-12-03 15:08:11	JacolynDandreano	yes
2015-12-03 15:08:17	JacolynDandreano	she did the whole thing
2015-12-03 15:08:45	JacolynDandreano	do you realize you have been talking to me for half a day with barely any breaks
2015-12-03 15:10:26	yama	if you're tired you can pretend you have a meeting
2015-12-03 15:12:24	JacolynDandreano	i usually only have one meeting per week
2015-12-03 15:12:40	JacolynDandreano	also im not tired. I'm just surprised that it is how you are spending your day off
2015-12-03 15:12:53	JacolynDandreano	tho i suppose you are probably chatting on irc and playing video games too
2015-12-03 15:12:54	JacolynDandreano	:P
2015-12-03 15:15:05	yama	im not chatting much on irc
2015-12-03 15:17:17	JacolynDandreano	read #10 http://i.imgur.com/EsOwgTg.jpg
2015-12-03 15:17:23	JacolynDandreano	someone else agrees with me...
2015-12-03 15:17:56	JacolynDandreano	tho i disagree with everything else on the scale lol
2015-12-03 15:18:01	JacolynDandreano	those 5s are not 5s
2015-12-03 15:18:41	JacolynDandreano	also it is racist. only black people are 4 or less
2015-12-03 15:20:37	yama	that's pretty dumb
2015-12-03 15:21:12	yama	"there are no outright, true 10s"... there's also no outright "true" 9s or 8s or 7s etc
2015-12-03 15:26:36	JacolynDandreano	well obviously
2015-12-03 15:26:36	JacolynDandreano	well obviously
2015-12-03 15:27:09	yama	also it's just faces
2015-12-03 15:27:10	JacolynDandreano	but it agrees with my idea that a 10 is merely a bias towards specific traits. in my case, a 10 is a bias towards personality/friendship
2015-12-03 15:27:27	yama	every number is a bias...
2015-12-03 15:27:38	yama	im getting a headache :/
2015-12-03 15:27:48	JacolynDandreano	no! mine are fairly objective
2015-12-03 15:27:58	JacolynDandreano	i can give specific reasons why points are taken off
2015-12-03 15:28:02	JacolynDandreano	similar to this person
2015-12-03 15:28:12	JacolynDandreano	feel better. :/
2015-12-03 15:29:18	yama	a lot of those 9s are far from 9s to me
2015-12-03 15:29:33	yama	that reason sounds more like "im too pussy to call someone a 10"
2015-12-03 15:38:34	JacolynDandreano	nah im not scared to call someone a 10
2015-12-03 15:38:41	JacolynDandreano	i would if i ever saw a 10
2015-12-03 15:38:46	JacolynDandreano	who wasnt my friend
2015-12-03 15:38:56	JacolynDandreano	those 9s are 10s to you?
2015-12-03 15:39:40	JacolynDandreano	i think second girl from the left in the 8s is prettier than most 9s there
2015-12-03 15:42:20	JacolynDandreano	apparently very overweight women automatically fall in 4. i disagree. i think some of them are pretty
2015-12-03 15:44:04	JacolynDandreano	and if i go by just picture comparison, id say i fall between 5.5 and 6 here. tho 4.5 on my scale. so i think he rates too high.  if i go by description only, id guess probably 6. since there isn't a 5.5 there either
2015-12-03 15:44:39	yama	no
2015-12-03 15:45:42	JacolynDandreano	the 9s are 8s?
2015-12-03 15:47:42	yama	some
2015-12-03 15:47:46	yama	like the 2nd 9
2015-12-03 15:47:54	yama	or 6th
2015-12-03 15:48:01	yama	or 3
2015-12-03 15:48:18	yama	it's dumb to judge on one pic anyway
2015-12-03 15:48:47	JacolynDandreano	well technically it is silly to rate at all.
2015-12-03 15:48:54	JacolynDandreano	but sometimes I'm in a stupid mood
2015-12-03 15:51:23	yama	ugh my head
2015-12-03 15:54:13	JacolynDandreano	drink water?
2015-12-03 15:54:28	yama	i guess
2015-12-03 15:59:13	yama	i want to make pizza
2015-12-03 15:59:18	yama	but i don't want the calories
2015-12-03 16:05:09	JacolynDandreano	ill eat half
2015-12-03 16:05:25	yama	that'd still leave the other half
2015-12-03 16:07:05	JacolynDandreano	I'm getting a headache too. this is your fault somehow
2015-12-03 16:14:12	yama	sry

2015-12-03 16:50:20	JacolynDandreano	i hope it doesn't rain
2015-12-03 16:50:25	yama	since im not gonna do anything with friends

2015-12-04 13:54:24	JacolynDandreano	i wonder how they taste
2015-12-04 13:54:38	yama	some people prefer them
2015-12-04 13:54:52	yama	they're great for fried empanadas
2015-12-04 13:55:16	JacolynDandreano	the ones I've eaten are usually made with these... but are usually puerto rican style http://www.cookingwiththepros.us/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0611.jpg
2015-12-04 13:55:16		[ http://is.gd/awIZXV ]

2015-12-04 14:03:59	JacolynDandreano	ugh
2015-12-04 14:04:03	JacolynDandreano	im so hungry now
2015-12-04 14:05:37	yama	what'd you do if i showed up at your work with a tray of them
2015-12-04 14:10:53	JacolynDandreano	jump on you and then eat it of course
2015-12-04 14:12:23	yama	wow no thanks? :(

2015-12-04 14:14:19	JacolynDandreano	no thanks to the jumping hug? or to me eating them? lol
2015-12-04 14:14:26	JacolynDandreano	no, give the 5th to me
2015-12-04 14:15:15	yama	oh i thought you meant like jumping on me to take them from me
2015-12-04 14:16:39	yama	there's still 10 left
2015-12-04 14:16:46	JacolynDandreano	well id assume you were bringing them in to share, so it would be a hug. if you brought them in to smugly parade them in front of me before eating them all yourself, i would totally jump you and steal them all for myself
2015-12-04 14:16:48	JacolynDandreano	:)
2015-12-04 14:17:26	yama	not to share, to give them all to you, cause i probably already ate enough on the way there
2015-12-04 14:19:18	JacolynDandreano	then i would hug you
2015-12-04 14:19:23	JacolynDandreano	and not hurt you
2015-12-04 14:19:42	JacolynDandreano	wouldn't want to damage the hands that would make me more empanadas in the future....
2015-12-04 14:19:49	yama	haha

2015-12-04 23:36:21	JacolynDandreano	It would be a tease if I said it was something u really needed to know
2015-12-04 23:37:29	yama	if i'd be disappointed then it's not even worth keeping it a secret :)

2015-12-04 23:38:12	yama	it is true

2015-12-08 14:20:45	yama	but the salad had more stuff than i usually put
2015-12-08 14:21:07	yama	and i put it on top of the burgers, i really like that combination
2015-12-08 14:22:05	JacolynDandreano	do you have a pic
2015-12-08 14:22:20	JacolynDandreano	that sounds really really good

2015-12-08 14:28:55	JacolynDandreano	:P
2015-12-08 14:32:45	yama	whats your first again?
2015-12-08 14:34:02	JacolynDandreano	bacon
2015-12-08 14:34:04	JacolynDandreano	obv
2015-12-08 14:34:32	yama	so you'd pick plain bacon over empanadas containing bacon?
2015-12-08 14:34:37	yama	or pizza with bacon?
2015-12-08 14:35:30	JacolynDandreano	So, remember how i said I'm going to try the /r/52weeksofcooking thing in 2016... well, they have an option of doing a "metatheme" where you pick a theme and stick with it all year but somehow make it work with each week's individual theme.  I chose sandwiches... https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/3uawsd/introducing_2016_metathemes/cxn7bzk
2015-12-08 14:35:31		[ http://is.gd/WfijDD ]
2015-12-08 14:35:38	JacolynDandreano	and yes, bacon is the best
2015-12-08 14:44:28	yama	interesting
2015-12-08 14:44:35	yama	you're going to eat so much bread
2015-12-08 14:48:04	JacolynDandreano	doesn't need to be a sandwich in the traditional sense
2015-12-08 14:48:28	yama	then?
2015-12-08 14:51:13	JacolynDandreano	i dunno. ill need to get creative
2015-12-08 14:51:47	yama	i have an idea
2015-12-08 14:51:59	yama	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWcKgSj66TM
2015-12-08 14:52:21	JacolynDandreano	blocked in my country
2015-12-08 14:52:24	JacolynDandreano	but i saw the title
2015-12-08 14:52:28	JacolynDandreano	:D
2015-12-08 14:52:30	yama	ugh
2015-12-08 14:52:35	yama	so much for freedom
2015-12-08 14:52:44	JacolynDandreano	i know!
2015-12-08 15:06:22	yama	i still have leg doms
2015-12-08 15:07:36	yama	did you ever watch the video i linked :(
2015-12-08 15:08:22	JacolynDandreano	which?
2015-12-08 15:08:40	JacolynDandreano	i have glute doms today
2015-12-08 15:09:14	yama	nvm
2015-12-09 14:43:14	JacolynDandreano	long story short, doc doesn't know what is wrong with me. says it could be labral tear which would be assessed with an MRI and would mean surgery if they found tears.  But, he thought I should maybe try PT 2x weekly for 4 weeks to treat possible internal shoulder impingement.  If it doesn't work, i need to get an MRI. Im not sure what I will do, but i won't be doing anything until January.
2015-12-09 14:43:36	JacolynDandreano	food looks good.
2015-12-09 14:48:24	yama	:(

2015-12-09 14:48:46	JacolynDandreano	yeah
2015-12-09 14:48:50	JacolynDandreano	im p disappointed
2015-12-09 14:49:07	JacolynDandreano	I'm leaning towards just doing the MRI first in January
2015-12-09 14:49:10	yama	well at least you're not worst
2015-12-09 14:49:16	yama	i thought something happened
2015-12-09 14:49:18	yama	why?
2015-12-09 14:50:20	yama	i don't get why you refuse to do any rehab :(
2015-12-09 14:51:41	JacolynDandreano	b/c i pay out of pocket for everything until $3000 has been spent that year. So, doing $800-$1600 of PT just to find out it was pointless b/c there is an actual tear is not helpful
2015-12-09 14:51:56	JacolynDandreano	but, i may do some PT stuff for it that i found online
2015-12-09 14:52:02	JacolynDandreano	since i need to wait until january anyway

2015-12-09 16:16:21	JacolynDandreano	I'm just sitting in my office for over an hour unable to do anything lol
2015-12-09 16:16:47	yama	just looking at him?
2015-12-09 16:16:55	yama	does he have nice forearms at least
2015-12-09 16:18:16	JacolynDandreano	Nah reading magazines and eating lunch and browsing reddit and stuff
2015-12-09 16:18:31	JacolynDandreano	can't see his forearms from here anyway
2015-12-09 16:18:43	yama	oh
2015-12-09 16:21:06	JacolynDandreano	So for the r/52weeksofcooking challenge, soup is week 1 in January. It needs to be in sandwich form to fit my meta theme. I'm thinking of doing an open-faced grilled cheese sandwich with homemade tomato soup IN it.
2015-12-09 16:21:26	JacolynDandreano	The soup would need to be really thick so that it doesn't run all over I think
2015-12-09 16:22:35	JacolynDandreano	and i am thinking of broiling some cheese underneath the soup so that it creates a little barrier between it and the bread so that the bread doesn't get soggy and/or break
2015-12-09 16:29:59	yama	sounds challenging
2015-12-09 16:32:14	JacolynDandreano	But does it sound good lol
2015-12-09 16:33:06	yama	im not a fan of soup so im the wrong person to ask
2015-12-09 16:35:58	JacolynDandreano	i can do something easier like take the elements of a popular soup and use them in sandwich form
2015-12-09 16:40:26	JacolynDandreano	Well I really like grilled cheese sandwiches and everyone always eats tomato soup with them and ppl often put tomatoes on their grilled cheese so I think that would work.... I guess I will need to think about it.
2015-12-09 16:40:52	yama	i rarely have them, but i want to make alton brown's grilled cheese grilled sandwich
2015-12-09 16:40:59	yama	i never ate tomato soup
2015-12-09 17:02:52	JacolynDandreano	I've never seen his recipe. I really like tomato soup. Ugh I really like anything rn

2015-12-11 15:04:59	JacolynDandreano	i can't remember mine. it had something to do with my shoulder
2015-12-11 15:06:01	JacolynDandreano	oh wait i do remember. antranik was giving me PT advice. and then at the end of a long email on the PT stuff. he put a line that said something like "also, it wouldn't hurt to show us one boob occasionally" or something
2015-12-11 15:06:06	JacolynDandreano	lol i should tell him
2015-12-11 15:06:40	JacolynDandreano	i think i dreamed about it b/c i had talked with him about my shoulder yesterday and also got a long wall of text about PT work from eshlow. so it mixed the two.
2015-12-11 15:06:46	JacolynDandreano	not sure about the boob part tho
2015-12-11 15:12:06	yama	hahah

2015-12-11 21:46:12	JacolynDandreano	I think I mostly like crisp outside and only a thin layer of chewiness above it

2015-12-11 22:07:06	yama	sometimes i call my mom....
2015-12-11 22:07:49	yama	i spray some bugspray around so they're usually on their last legs (that's an expression right?)
2015-12-11 22:08:00	yama	but if they're huge and fully alive i panic
2015-12-11 22:08:08	yama	i think at some point in my life it was close to a phobia
2015-12-11 22:28:28	JacolynDandreano	Yikes. I wouldn't like that. I hate spiders with a passion
2015-12-11 22:28:57	yama	i think i killed 5 spiders too

2015-12-11 22:31:02	yama	7th cockroach
2015-12-11 22:31:11	yama	depends on type of spider
2015-12-11 22:31:41	JacolynDandreano	Omg! I would have a vacuum ready and vacuum them all up

2015-12-11 22:34:44	JacolynDandreano	Well u said You will be at ur friend's...
2015-12-11 22:35:01	JacolynDandreano	So it depends on if we are online :)
2015-12-11 22:36:18	yama	ill be online from there
2015-12-11 22:36:21	yama	but if you're not

2015-12-11 22:37:13	JacolynDandreano	give me pizza pics
2015-12-11 22:37:26	yama	you didn't show me your shoulder rom
2015-12-11 22:37:36	JacolynDandreano	Oh I forgot
2015-12-11 22:37:46	JacolynDandreano	let me try to find it before my phone die
2015-12-11 22:37:49	JacolynDandreano	s
2015-12-11 22:38:35	JacolynDandreano	http://imgur.com/a/pdRGS
2015-12-11 22:40:13	JacolynDandreano	See how my arm can go beyond my shoulder in the top pic? That's excessive external rotation ROM. And the second pic shows limited internal rotation ROM because I can only bring my arm there but it should be able to go all the way down to be in line with my body
2015-12-11 22:40:29	JacolynDandreano	So that could be internal impingement
2015-12-11 22:40:38	JacolynDandreano	Ok bye for real
2015-12-11 22:42:38	yama	so the excessive external rotation is a symptom of that too?? or were you flexible in that aspect beforehand
2015-12-11 23:34:02	yama	you look tired but cute
2015-12-11 23:38:40	--	irc: disconnected from server
2015-12-12 13:35:26	JacolynDandreano	I have no idea if I had that ROM before.  But I guess it can cause internal impingement. That was at work a few days ago. I was probably really bored lol
2015-12-12 13:53:36	yama	you have much more external rotation than me
2015-12-12 13:53:37	--	[JacolynDandreano] is away: Offline
2015-12-12 13:53:40	yama	what about the other arm?
2015-12-12 18:11:28	JacolynDandreano	I think it is more worrisome that I have less internal rotation I think...? That my arm doesn't go down farther than that in that angle
2015-12-12 18:11:44	JacolynDandreano	Are u at ur friend's house?
2015-12-12 18:16:32	yama	not yet, i was getting a haircut and a shower

2015-12-15 22:18:33	yama	:')
2015-12-15 22:20:51	JacolynDandreano	ok so remember how I originally read 75% of the count and just stopped eventually and then went back this year and read like 40% before I realized it was abridged (600+ pages)so then I got this pdf on my kindle that I thought for sure was unabridged because it was close to 800 or 900 pages. I'm at 50% exactly rn. So, the other day I read that the unabridged version is like 1000+ pages. So I started to worry but I told
2015-12-15 22:20:51	JacolynDandreano	myself that it must be because the font is super tiny in the pdf. But Kayetech showed me the kindle version he is reading and it is over 1000 pages
2015-12-15 22:20:59	JacolynDandreano	so now I'm going to start over with that one
2015-12-15 22:21:17	JacolynDandreano	I'm so sad
2015-12-15 22:21:29	yama	lol wtf
2015-12-15 22:21:36	yama	that's what you get for reading in pdf
2015-12-15 22:21:39	JacolynDandreano	i like the book, but this is going to be like the fourth time I read the first half
2015-12-15 22:21:45	JacolynDandreano	yeah I know :(
2015-12-15 22:22:08	yama	why don't you just start from the point you left
2015-12-15 22:22:29	JacolynDandreano	Because I'll feel like I missed somethjng
2015-12-15 22:22:52	JacolynDandreano	now that I know the kindle version is the full one, I can't let it go

2015-12-15 22:38:15	JacolynDandreano	I am sitting on my couch with a blanket and waiting for the count to load
2015-12-15 22:38:28	JacolynDandreano	im also debating getting a banana popsicle
2015-12-15 22:38:29	yama	why is it taking so long to load
2015-12-15 22:38:34	JacolynDandreano	im not sure
2015-12-15 22:38:34	yama	just get a banana
2015-12-15 22:38:45	JacolynDandreano	i don't have a banana

2015-12-15 22:40:44	JacolynDandreano	if I escape from the Internet tab that it is downloading from, should it still load?
2015-12-15 22:40:50	JacolynDandreano	i accidentally did that
2015-12-15 22:40:59	JacolynDandreano	it says "in progress"
2015-12-15 22:41:07	yama	it should as long as the browser isn't shit
2015-12-15 22:41:17	yama	why not download through computer and send it via usb cable
2015-12-15 22:41:26	JacolynDandreano	well it kinda is because it is just kindle fire browser
2015-12-15 22:41:50	yama	you know you can send books via email
2015-12-15 22:41:51	JacolynDandreano	because I don't think the cable fits my kindle
2015-12-15 22:43:19	JacolynDandreano	I'm not sure how to stop the download
2015-12-15 22:43:19	yama	i think it's just a regular microusb

2015-12-15 22:51:06	JacolynDandreano	the one he got it from
2015-12-15 22:51:17	JacolynDandreano	maybe I should download the ePub instead
2015-12-15 22:51:27	JacolynDandreano	usually downloads don't take this long

2015-12-15 23:02:15	JacolynDandreano	Ok so you get into the car and she jumps into the back seat. You wait for her to tell her father what happened with the thug but she says nothing.

2015-12-17 12:57:40	JacolynDandreano	for some reason
2015-12-17 12:58:17	yama	i kept thinking of it because of the water well
2015-12-17 12:58:31	JacolynDandreano	interesting
2015-12-17 12:58:36	JacolynDandreano	that didn't cross my mind
2015-12-17 12:58:37	JacolynDandreano	at all
2015-12-17 12:59:10	yama	the original movie is japanese if you didnt know
2015-12-17 12:59:24	yama	i really liked the dream sequences
2015-12-17 12:59:46	yama	i also thought of silent hill sometimes
2015-12-17 13:01:20	JacolynDandreano	yeah i did know that it was originally japanese
2015-12-17 13:01:36	JacolynDandreano	I'm reading the article now
2015-12-17 13:01:41	yama	what does it say
2015-12-17 13:01:45	JacolynDandreano	there are 61 pages missing
2015-12-17 13:01:58	JacolynDandreano	but it looks like i only missed 1-2 chapters
2015-12-17 13:02:08	JacolynDandreano	everything else was just kept but moved or condensed
2015-12-17 13:02:15	JacolynDandreano	and the article summarizes the chapters
2015-12-17 13:02:19	yama	sounds about right for how much longer it took me :p
2015-12-17 13:02:25	yama	what parts are they?
2015-12-17 13:03:13	JacolynDandreano	three chapters (Book 2 Chapters 15, 18, and part of 17; and Book 3 Chapter 26)
2015-12-17 13:03:23	yama	uhh
2015-12-17 13:03:32	JacolynDandreano	the first missing chapter is when he prepares to go to crete
2015-12-17 13:03:51	yama	hmm
2015-12-17 13:03:51	JacolynDandreano	he wakes up with the clairvoyant woman Creta Kanō, who had mysteriously appeared in his bed the night before. She says that she has lost her name, and invites him to flee Japan with her and go to Crete. He burns all the memorabilia left by his wife, goes into town, and buys a suitcase. He reads an article the protagonist reads about his nemesis and brother in law, Noboru Wataya, who is trying to become a politician. A
2015-12-17 13:03:51	JacolynDandreano	large portion of the article is included in the text.
2015-12-17 13:03:56	JacolynDandreano	^
2015-12-17 13:04:03	JacolynDandreano	that's the first summary
2015-12-17 13:06:53	JacolynDandreano	In Chapter 17, Tōru takes a passport photo and meets with his uncle, who explains how to select real estate properties by standing for hours watching passerby. The passport scene is deleted and Tōru’s uncle’s 9-page explanation is condensed to an English paragraph. The rest of the chapter is unabridged.
2015-12-17 13:07:25	yama	damn
2015-12-17 13:07:29	yama	i found that bit interesting
2015-12-17 13:07:33	yama	with the uncle
2015-12-17 13:07:49	JacolynDandreano	In the deleted sections of Chapter 18, Creta Kanō returns, and Tōru informs her of his intention to remain in Japan. He meets May Kasahara, and they watch the demolition of the Miyawaki house. He swims in the ward pool and has a vision of floating in the bottom of the well hearing horses dying during an eclipse. This leads him to a revelation that the strange woman on the telephone is none other than his wife Kumiko,
2015-12-17 13:07:49	JacolynDandreano	ending Book 2 on a cliffhanger.
2015-12-17 13:07:57	yama	also when he goes to take the photo i believe the photographer tries to cover his stain on his cheek
2015-12-17 13:08:11	JacolynDandreano	Chapter 26 is deleted entirely. In that chapter, Tōru has a direct computer chat with his nemesis, Noboru Wataya, and threatens to invade his dreams. The English version lacks a table of contents, but if the chapters in both texts are arranged side-by-side, the deletions are apparent.
2015-12-17 13:08:40	yama	you didn't read the dream in the pool then?

2015-12-17 13:25:50	JacolynDandreano	lol
2015-12-17 13:26:01	JacolynDandreano	I'm still reading the article
2015-12-17 13:26:15	yama	are you upset at what's missing?
2015-12-17 13:26:15	JacolynDandreano	no i would never
2015-12-17 13:26:39	JacolynDandreano	not terribly upset b/c it is still talking about how the missing pieces affect the book
2015-12-17 13:26:47	JacolynDandreano	so at least i can get it summarized to me
2015-12-17 13:26:57	JacolynDandreano	tho it is a bit annoying that i can't read another language
2015-12-17 13:27:22	yama	btw
2015-12-17 13:27:25	yama	https://www.reddit.com/r/murakami/comments/2xjiy6/windup_bird_chronicles_abridged/
2015-12-17 13:27:56	JacolynDandreano	i suppose my best bet would be to have you copy/paste those chapters from the spanish and then just work my way through them
2015-12-17 13:28:02	JacolynDandreano	but that would take me a while
2015-12-17 13:28:25	JacolynDandreano	the article agrees with the first comment
2015-12-17 13:28:31	JacolynDandreano	that he approved and liked the changes
2015-12-17 13:29:00	yama	is the article detailed enough or do you want me to summarize them too?
2015-12-17 13:29:04	JacolynDandreano	but the article also says that the translator should have included them separately in an appendix or something
2015-12-17 13:29:20	JacolynDandreano	well i dunno
2015-12-17 13:29:27	JacolynDandreano	i just showed you what it has told me so far
2015-12-17 13:33:07	yama	i'll summarize the chat if you want
2015-12-17 13:33:16	JacolynDandreano	which chat

2015-12-17 13:36:06	JacolynDandreano	you'd have no choice
2015-12-17 13:36:12	JacolynDandreano	either talk to me or be more bored
2015-12-17 13:36:25	yama	um but you were getting online later and later in the day
2015-12-17 13:36:26	JacolynDandreano	"By omitting these chapters, three major changes are made. First, without the vision of swimming in the well, Tōru’s transformation from patient to agent is not motivated." <-- this is one of the confusing things in the book for me. now i know why
2015-12-17 13:36:36	yama	and i was constantly checking if you replied and was sads
2015-12-17 13:36:52	JacolynDandreano	lol
2015-12-17 13:36:59	yama	ok is the dream summarized in that article?
2015-12-17 13:37:05	yama	wow you lol at my sadness, cruel
2015-12-17 13:37:09	JacolynDandreano	im not sure
2015-12-17 13:37:14	JacolynDandreano	i told you the basic summaries
2015-12-17 13:37:17	JacolynDandreano	let me read more
2015-12-17 13:37:28	JacolynDandreano	i <3 u for being sad about that in particular
2015-12-17 13:37:59	yama	i can try to translate that dream
2015-12-17 13:38:01	yama	buttttt
2015-12-17 13:38:07	yama	i won't be able to write a story if i do that
2015-12-17 13:38:29	yama	also, are we going to pick another book or do you want to focus on the count
2015-12-17 13:40:59	JacolynDandreano	I'm reading part of the dream now i think
2015-12-17 13:41:02	JacolynDandreano	hold on
2015-12-17 13:41:08	JacolynDandreano	ill answer ur questions in a min
2015-12-17 13:41:41	JacolynDandreano	yeah I'm reading a translated passage of the vision
2015-12-17 13:44:31	yama	also i found a playlist of every song mentioned in muramaki's books
2015-12-17 13:46:41	JacolynDandreano	"During the well vision, he dreams that he is having sex with Creta Kanō, when she changes into the phone woman, and the room changes into Room 208. Suddenly, he realizes the phone woman is actually his wife. In the English, the idea that the phone woman, the woman in Room 208, and Kumiko might be one in the same is not presented until near the end of the novel, but in the Japanese it is stated explicitly, with emphasis"
2015-12-17 13:46:46	JacolynDandreano	im so happy I'm reading all this
2015-12-17 13:46:56	JacolynDandreano	it is explaining so many discrepancies lol
2015-12-17 13:47:53	yama	that's so weird cause in the end it's clearly a return to that room
2015-12-17 13:48:09	yama	at one point i was gonna ask you what you thought about him discovering it was kumiko on the phone
2015-12-17 13:48:38	JacolynDandreano	yeah but when it returns to the room, he somehow just randomly knows it is kumiko
2015-12-17 13:48:42	JacolynDandreano	in the english version
2015-12-17 13:48:47	JacolynDandreano	which is confusing as hell
2015-12-17 13:48:53	JacolynDandreano	b/c it isn't explained at all
2015-12-17 13:49:02	JacolynDandreano	and that is almost the end
2015-12-17 13:49:23	JacolynDandreano	"Rubin has said that 'the clairvoyant Kanō sisters detract from the book,' and Creta Kanō’s part in the novel is made less significant by the omissions"
2015-12-17 13:49:41	yama	weird
2015-12-17 13:49:48	yama	who were your favorite characters?
2015-12-17 13:49:58	yama	you can answer later when you're done reading this
2015-12-17 13:50:01	JacolynDandreano	cinnamon
2015-12-17 13:50:04	JacolynDandreano	i liked him
2015-12-17 13:50:42	yama	oh yes
2015-12-17 13:51:01	yama	i also liked mamiya a lot
2015-12-17 13:51:45	JacolynDandreano	With the omissions, the phone woman and Creta Kanō are loose ends, when both could be said to be projections of the protagonist’s wife, evidenced by the sexual dream sequence. Murakami has said in an interview, “I think sex is an act of . . . a kind of soul-commitment. If the sex is good, your injury will be healed, your imagination will be invigorated. It’s a kind of passage to the upper area, to the better place.
2015-12-17 13:51:45	JacolynDandreano	In that sense, in my stories, women are mediums—harbingers of the coming world.”19 Creta Kanō is a psychic medium by trade, and the foil for May Kasahara. In the same interview, the interviewer said, “There seem to be two distinct types of women in your novels: those with whom the protagonist has a fundamentally serious relationship—often this is the woman who disappears and whose memory haunts him—and the
2015-12-17 13:51:45	JacolynDandreano	other kind of woman, who comes later and helps him in his search, or to do the opposite—to forget,” and Murakami acknowledges this as “one of the main motifs in my work.”20 Murakami has said,
2015-12-17 13:51:45	JacolynDandreano	My protagonist is almost always caught between the spiritual world and the real world. In the spiritual world, the women—or men—are quiet, intelligent, modest. Wise. In the realistic world, as you say, the women are very active, comic, positive. They have a sense of humor. The protagonist’s mind is split between these totally different worlds and he cannot choose which to take.21
2015-12-17 13:51:49	JacolynDandreano	this is all interesting ^
2015-12-17 13:52:07	JacolynDandreano	I'm practically copy/pasting the whole article for you lol
2015-12-17 13:53:36	yama	:)
2015-12-17 13:53:48	yama	keep going
2015-12-17 13:55:25	JacolynDandreano	keep going what?
2015-12-17 13:55:31	JacolynDandreano	keep reading? stop taking breaks? lol
2015-12-17 13:56:06	yama	keep pasting what you find interesting
2015-12-17 13:56:25	JacolynDandreano	May Kasahara represents Tōru’s grounding in the “real world,” while Creta Kanō offers to remove him to the “spiritual world.” In the end, he does not cross over completely, but moves in and out of the spiritual world through wells.
2015-12-17 13:56:54	JacolynDandreano	Another minor character, the primary antagonist, Tōru’s brother in law Noboru Wataya, also features prominently in the deleted sections, which include an interview and a computer chat. Without these sections, there are fewer instances of the voice of the antagonist, and he becomes less important as a character. The computer chat is the only place where the protagonist stands up to the antagonist by threating to invade
2015-12-17 13:56:54	JacolynDandreano	his dreams. However, like the trip to Greece, the threat never pans out in the plot.
2015-12-17 13:57:19	JacolynDandreano	this is all relating to how the plot was changed by these omissions, BTW ^
2015-12-17 13:58:00	yama	wait what does it mean the threat never pans out, he threatens to hurt him in his dreams, and then he hurts him in a dream
2015-12-17 13:58:10	JacolynDandreano	the ups delivery person was staring at my boobs
2015-12-17 13:58:12	JacolynDandreano	im p sure

2015-12-17 14:18:44	yama	the first few are classical 
2015-12-17 14:19:04	yama	the thieving magpie i believe is the song most referenced in the book
2015-12-17 14:19:12	yama	were you offended that she looked at your boobs
2015-12-17 14:19:23	JacolynDandreano	ill listen later i guess
2015-12-17 14:19:29	JacolynDandreano	why would be offended
2015-12-17 14:19:50	yama	oh no, i think it's the gazza ladra
2015-12-17 14:19:51	yama	dunno
2015-12-17 14:20:07	yama	have you ever seen any david lynch films
2015-12-17 14:20:18	JacolynDandreano	uh idk
2015-12-17 14:20:21	JacolynDandreano	don't know that name
2015-12-17 14:20:38	JacolynDandreano	I'm only halfway thru this articlee
2015-12-17 14:20:43	yama	didn't think so
2015-12-17 14:20:46	yama	oh is it that long?
2015-12-17 14:23:43	JacolynDandreano	nah but i keep taking breaks to copy/paste to you and also to do work
2015-12-17 14:24:00	JacolynDandreano	Murakami himself is a translator (of English to Japanese) who has translated a diverse group of English writers into Japanese. Murakami has said that he considers his writing in Japanese a process of translation and translation itself a kind of criticism, and that he never re-reads his works in Japanese. He seems to consider details secondary to the gestalt of a work in translation.
2015-12-17 14:25:04	yama	i read about that, that he translated american authors that were his inspiration
2015-12-17 14:25:39	JacolynDandreano	yeah
2015-12-17 14:25:49	JacolynDandreano	this is what he said.. 
2015-12-17 14:25:49	JacolynDandreano	By having a work converted into another language by someone else’s hand, I can look back and reconsider it from a respectable distance and enjoy it coolly as a quasi-outsider, as it were, whereas I never would have read it again if it had remained only in Japanese.
2015-12-17 14:25:49	JacolynDandreano	[....]
2015-12-17 14:25:49	JacolynDandreano	One may say, then, that I might as well write in a foreign language from the start. But this is not easily done, for reasons of skill and capability. That may be why, in my own way, I have tried to write my novels using prose that I have constructed by first converting Japanese, my mother tongue, into a mock foreign language in my head—that is, by clearing away the innate everydayness of language that lies in my self-
2015-12-17 14:25:49	JacolynDandreano	consciousness[...]
2015-12-17 14:25:49	JacolynDandreano	Seen in that light, my process of creative writing may closely correspond to the process of translation—or rather, in some respects they may be two sides of the same coin.32
2015-12-17 14:27:22	yama	this is oddly fitting with what i did of reading in spanish, but "hearing" the dialogs in fake japanese in my head
2015-12-17 14:29:31	JacolynDandreano	that's interesting
2015-12-17 14:29:40	JacolynDandreano	i didn't do that b/c I'm dumb
2015-12-17 14:30:28	JacolynDandreano	ok i finished the article. can you summarize what happened with the chat
2015-12-17 14:30:48	JacolynDandreano	they didn't say much other than that he talks online with him and the narrator threatens to invade his dreams
2015-12-17 14:32:46	JacolynDandreano	also, was it properly explained that he bought the murakami house or that he started working there?
2015-12-17 14:32:52	JacolynDandreano	those two things seemed a bit random
2015-12-17 14:33:05	JacolynDandreano	and i only picked up on them b/c they were hinted at first
2015-12-17 14:33:19	JacolynDandreano	also, why was kumiko in jail at the end
2015-12-17 14:34:25	JacolynDandreano	and how did noboru get hurt? Toru invaded his mind when he went into the well, right?
2015-12-17 14:34:36	JacolynDandreano	and why did he beat up that weird guy with the bat
2015-12-17 14:34:42	JacolynDandreano	the guy with the candle
2015-12-17 14:34:55	JacolynDandreano	was that part of a dream?
2015-12-17 14:45:18	JacolynDandreano	also, i want to pick another book to read with you. ill read count on the side.  but, i want to read something from the list.
2015-12-17 14:46:12	JacolynDandreano	and i'd prefer to read something from the group I'm in.... Right now they chose Cloudsplitter and they also chose The Story of the Stone (AKA The Dream of the Red Chamber)
2015-12-17 14:46:48	JacolynDandreano	they are voting for the january books right now. so far Dark Child has the most votes, then the Shining and Annie John both have slightly less
2015-12-17 14:47:31	JacolynDandreano	are any of those books ones that you have been wanting to read? if not, just pick a different one from the list if you can
2015-12-17 14:50:18	JacolynDandreano	if you want to read more murakami, he has 5 others on the list: 1Q84, Kafka on the Shore, After the Quake, Sputnik Sweetheart, Almost Transparent Blue
2015-12-17 14:50:57	JacolynDandreano	anyway i just gave you quite a few things to answer. it's almost as bad as that person who sent me 30 paragraphs of complaints against me yesterday :P
2015-12-17 14:51:11	JacolynDandreano	ill let you answer them, since i need to go in a little while
2015-12-17 14:51:13	JacolynDandreano	bbl
2015-12-17 15:03:20	yama	murakami house?
2015-12-17 15:05:36	yama	okay from memory, first, he asks ushikawa for a chat with noboru and he says it's gonna be very hard but he's gonna try to persuade him
2015-12-17 15:06:06	yama	so apparently noboru agrees and they start talking, he mentions like always that he's wasting his time
2015-12-17 15:06:43	yama	and he says kumiko is away from toru from her own will
2015-12-17 15:07:25	yama	and toru says that he feels he's getting close to something, and he mentions he told this to kumiko in the previous chat
2015-12-17 15:08:28	yama	noboru says he has no idea what he's talking about, he mentions the deal with buying the mansion is off because there's too much media attention on it, and apparently he knows toru's business, whatever it is, was stopped, so he says toru has nothing to leverage against him and can't threaten him
2015-12-17 15:09:08	yama	and toru says that when they previously met, at the hotel with malta, he threatened to uncover a secret, but he was bluffing, but that now he knows he's getting close to something
2015-12-17 15:15:26	yama	i think he also says that he can help noboru by getting rid of something within his dreams in exchange for kumiko. He also says he can guess what he did to kumiko's older sister, and that he's getting "closer and closer to the secret you hide under your mask. And that's something that must scare you. It's better if you don't try to hide that fear." And noboru signs off immediately
2015-12-17 15:16:21	yama	the mansion from what i understood, was bought by nutmeg and he was paying it in monthly payments i think
2015-12-17 15:17:01	yama	kumiko was in jail because she killed noboru, that was pretty much explained word for word in her letter at the end, I'm not sure why you'd be confused about that D:
2015-12-17 15:17:30	yama	he hurt noboru rescuing kumiko
2015-12-17 15:17:46	yama	i wouldn't say it was noboru's mind, i'd call it the "dream realm" or something like that
2015-12-17 15:19:34	yama	the singer with the candle, he just followed him, and for some stupid reason went into his house after him and the guy obviously was scared that someone came in and tried to hit him and toru in self defense fought back but something inside him didn't let him stop hitting him, probably his exploration into the dark corners of his psyche and the frustration about losing kumiko
2015-12-17 15:20:06	yama	and that wasn't a dream, that's where he got the baseball bat
2015-12-17 15:20:54	yama	i don't know if i'm interested in cloudsplitter or story of the store or dark child cause i never heard of them
2015-12-17 15:21:03	yama	i've read the shinning and don't plan to read it again
2015-12-17 15:21:17	yama	i want to read more murakami but later
2015-12-17 15:21:37	yama	i talked more than you now :)
2015-12-17 15:53:14	JacolynDandreano	ok time to read your replies

2015-12-17 15:59:20	JacolynDandreano	wait, what letter from kumiko? did i miss a letter? or did i read a letter from her thinking it was May's
2015-12-17 15:59:31	JacolynDandreano	she killed him? how did she kill him
2015-12-17 16:04:31	JacolynDandreano	ok so you aren't interested in any of those books?  are ANY of these on the list of ones you have been meaning to read?

2015-12-17 18:32:38	JacolynDandreano	why wouldn't I
2015-12-17 18:32:50	JacolynDandreano	I'd just be sad that they would take up all your time
2015-12-17 18:32:53	yama	cause i'd probably talk more to her
2015-12-17 18:35:15	JacolynDandreano	I would def be sad
2015-12-17 18:35:20	JacolynDandreano	but I wouldn't be jelly
2015-12-17 18:35:33	JacolynDandreano	I'd be happy that you were happy
2015-12-17 18:35:48	JacolynDandreano	unless it was someone I disapproved of
2015-12-17 18:35:52	yama	maybe i wouldn't be
2015-12-17 18:35:56	JacolynDandreano	then I would be annoyed
2015-12-17 18:36:03	JacolynDandreano	wouldnt be what?
2015-12-17 18:36:08	yama	happy
2015-12-17 18:36:40	JacolynDandreano	Why would you be with a girl if you weren't happy tho
2015-12-17 18:36:51	yama	dunno, maybe toxic relationship
2015-12-17 18:37:05	JacolynDandreano	Then I would force you to get out of it
2015-12-17 18:37:07	JacolynDandreano	:P
2015-12-17 18:38:52	yama	how
2015-12-17 18:40:19	JacolynDandreano	I would walk over there and pick up the phone and dial it for you and hold it to your ear and dangle pizza just out of reach and tell you that you can have a slice once you break it off
2015-12-17 18:40:31	yama	haha
2015-12-17 18:40:48	yama	i will now try to get into a toxic relationship just to meet you irl and feed me pizza
2015-12-17 18:41:20	JacolynDandreano	That's mean
2015-12-17 18:41:27	JacolynDandreano	it would take a lot of walking for me
2015-12-17 18:41:46	yama	you'd be more skelly than momo8, just like you always wanted
2015-12-17 18:45:52	JacolynDandreano	True
2015-12-17 18:46:16	JacolynDandreano	but then I wouldn't be strong enough to force you to read and to take your blankets and stuff
2015-12-17 18:46:38	JacolynDandreano	i would try to steal blankets and not be able to even pull them off the bed
2015-12-17 18:47:17	yama	wow ty for aiding my plan
2015-12-17 18:48:15	JacolynDandreano	Pls don't get in a toxic relationship tho
2015-12-17 18:48:23	JacolynDandreano	I don't have proper walking shoes
2015-12-17 18:48:36	yama	it's not something one plans tho
2015-12-17 18:48:43	JacolynDandreano	Yes that is a nice case
2015-12-17 18:48:45	yama	what if i end up like toru
2015-12-17 18:48:53	JacolynDandreano	did you buy it at your job
2015-12-17 18:49:02	yama	ye, from the guy who makes them
2015-12-17 18:49:05	yama	a sweet old man
2015-12-17 18:49:09	JacolynDandreano	end up with a girl stuck in another dimension?
2015-12-17 18:49:44	yama	yes, and have dream sex
2015-12-17 18:49:51	yama	while my wife sleeps with dozens of strangers
2015-12-17 18:50:38	JacolynDandreano	Sounds toxic enough
2015-12-17 18:50:57	JacolynDandreano	I would break it off before u married her tho
2015-12-17 18:52:01	yama	tbh if i ever marry, which i doubt, it'd probably be because the girl wants it
2015-12-17 18:52:16	JacolynDandreano	Why
2015-12-17 18:52:44	yama	cause i don't really want to
2015-12-17 18:52:56	JacolynDandreano	Why
2015-12-17 18:53:21	yama	dunno, i guess i don't see much the point, since i don't want a family either
2015-12-17 18:53:43	JacolynDandreano	Why
2015-12-17 18:54:53	yama	i don't have the urge to have offspring, i don't feel myself capable of being a father, im selfish with my time, and at the same time i think having a kid is a bit selfish when you can adopt and when the planet is over populated already
2015-12-17 18:56:38	yama	like i don't even see myself capable of having a stable relationship lol
2015-12-17 18:59:10	JacolynDandreano	Are you against the idea of procreating specifically? Or you'd rather not be a father even with adoption?
2015-12-17 18:59:30	JacolynDandreano	and what do you think would stop you from having a stable relationship
2015-12-17 19:00:15	yama	im not against the idea, i think it's a bit selfish, but im aware it's a decision mostly based on culture and tradition and feelings and biological imperatives
2015-12-17 19:00:27	yama	um living with my mom
2015-12-17 19:00:41	yama	do you know any girl irl who would actually date me 
2015-12-17 19:02:05	yama	 does it bother you that i feel that way?
2015-12-17 19:12:15	JacolynDandreano	I don't know any single girls really
2015-12-17 19:12:40	JacolynDandreano	and I'm not sure how you would act irl so I don't know how your personality would match with ppl I know
2015-12-17 19:12:54	JacolynDandreano	but living with your mom isn't a big deal imo
2015-12-17 19:13:57	JacolynDandreano	but girls usually want to know that their guy has a plan to take care of them for the future. Not in a gold digger way but more like "I'll try to support the family as best as I can while you do the same" type of way
2015-12-17 19:14:46	JacolynDandreano	on the other hand, if you find a girl who doesn't care about marriage either and just wants to date then she might not care if you have a plan for the future
2015-12-17 19:15:09	JacolynDandreano	and it doesn't bother me. Was just curious about the reasoning
2015-12-17 19:23:28	yama	yeah i figured like every girl you know is married or engaged lol
2015-12-17 19:23:33	yama	but i meant, if they were single
2015-12-17 19:23:50	yama	brb again
2015-12-17 19:23:51	JacolynDandreano	Yeah :/ so many weddings
2015-12-17 19:25:22	JacolynDandreano	honestly, IMO it doesn't matter if you live with your mom for the next 20 years if you were working towards a plan. But if you don't have a plan at all for the future, then I think a lot of girls would wonder how the future would play out if you live past your mom.
2015-12-17 19:25:30	JacolynDandreano	Sorry that sounds horribly morbid
2015-12-17 19:26:51	yama	lol it's okay
2015-12-17 19:27:49	JacolynDandreano	When you come back I want to know what your book pick is now that we finished

2015-12-17 19:39:50	JacolynDandreano	I don't want to respond to the person who messaged me yesterday. I should just tell them that I changed my mind and I don't care about their gripes and that them messaging me on my personal fb when I made it clear for the past two to three months that I want to distance myself from the chan is stirring up drama. And especially since they brought a mod into it.
2015-12-17 19:40:10	JacolynDandreano	but I told myself I will politely respond tomorrow
2015-12-17 19:40:10	JacolynDandreano	but I told myself I will politely respond tomorrow

2015-12-17 23:51:35	JacolynDandreano	:)
2015-12-17 23:51:52	yama	the dream is literally two lines
2015-12-17 23:51:55	JacolynDandreano	I needed to take a minibreak from the book
2015-12-17 23:52:09	yama	why? is it dense?
2015-12-17 23:52:12	JacolynDandreano	the prose is a bit dense
2015-12-17 23:52:14	JacolynDandreano	yes
2015-12-17 23:52:38	JacolynDandreano	I'm tired tho
2015-12-17 23:52:44	yama	anyway, the dream, I was at my friend's dad's house, haven't been there in years, his dad is a standup comic
2015-12-17 23:52:47	JacolynDandreano	so that makes it harder to concentrate
2015-12-17 23:52:56	yama	so we were there, sitting on the floor
2015-12-17 23:53:08	yama	we were playing a board game
2015-12-17 23:53:26	yama	and his dad came in, he had been away on vacations for like 3 weeks
2015-12-17 23:53:53	yama	so we greet and i make awkward small talk about how the trip was and the plane ride
2015-12-17 23:54:06	yama	and he's like it was alright
2015-12-17 23:55:53	yama	and then he starts telling my friend that he got to used to living in houses, that in an appartment you should never leave the key inside the lock (i assumed he said that cause apartments have only one entrance while houses usually have more than one)
2015-12-17 23:56:06	yama	and he starts cursing at him
2015-12-17 23:56:12	yama	and that's all i remember
2015-12-17 23:56:13	JacolynDandreano	Oh geez

2015-12-17 23:57:56	JacolynDandreano	byee
2015-12-17 23:58:01	yama	gn
2015-12-18 00:40:54	yama	you wake up one cool morning at your usual time but you notice something strange, you're not in your apartment but in a house. Somehow you don't feel panic but rather calm, as you look around you the morning sun caresses the white walls of your cozy unknown bedroom. You're fully dressed in long pajamas that feel soft and clean, and you sit up in bed, with your legs still under 5 blankets. You
2015-12-18 00:40:54	yama	look around, the room is small but everthing in it feels like it  is where it belongs, even the things scattered around the carpet floor, such as a silent music box that fell on its side, a hand mirror that seems to be waiting for someone to look into it, and in the corner of the room, as if it was hiding, a silver necklace.
2015-12-18 00:51:28	yama	Even tho the blankets are thick and comfy and they feel like clouds hugging you, you decide to get up and investigate this oddly calm house. There's not a sound besides your own bare feet treading across the cream-colored carpet. Two floors thoroughly researched with curiosity leave you even more puzzled, there's no one in the house nor signs than anyone has ever been there except you. There's
2015-12-18 00:51:28	yama	a thin layer of snow outside but you decide to go out and find out where you are. The water seems to be working fine so you fill the bath tub with pretty hot water, you take the pajamas off and carefuly fold it and place it on a shelf, their fabric felt so nice you thought they didn't deserve to be thrown on the bathroom floor. You quckily get in the bath tub, the dense layer of bubbles on the
2015-12-18 00:51:28	yama	surface reminds you of the blankets in the bed and before you realize you fall asleep. It is now dark as you wake up but the full moon is bright enough to make the bathroom visible under its blue breath, like a whisper of what they used to be in the sunlight. Quickly tho, a thought strikes you: even tho you spent several hours asleep on the tub, the water has not cooled down.
2015-12-18 10:53:04	JacolynDandreano	Don't just laugh. Write more!
2015-12-18 10:53:04	JacolynDandreano	Don't just laugh. Write more!

2015-12-18 11:31:26	JacolynDandreano	i was getting some work done
2015-12-18 11:31:39	JacolynDandreano	now I'm going to start to formulate a response to that person
2015-12-18 11:31:46	JacolynDandreano	and try to have it done by 11
2015-12-18 11:31:46	JacolynDandreano	and try to have it done by 11
2015-12-18 11:31:46	JacolynDandreano	and try to have it done by 11
2015-12-18 11:31:46	JacolynDandreano	and try to have it done by 11
2015-12-18 11:31:48	JacolynDandreano	that's my goal
2015-12-18 11:32:19	yama	you're going to spend 1:30 hours on it??
2015-12-18 11:32:31	JacolynDandreano	maybe more
2015-12-18 11:32:35	yama	you should just tell me who it is 
2015-12-18 11:32:39	JacolynDandreano	no
2015-12-18 11:32:48	JacolynDandreano	i'd be in the wrong for gossiping
2015-12-18 11:32:51	yama	yess
2015-12-18 11:32:54	yama	who cares
2015-12-18 11:33:07	yama	i will bribe you with food pics
2015-12-18 11:33:13	JacolynDandreano	and i can't accuse them of being disrespectful to me if i myself am not respecting them on at least a higher level
2015-12-18 11:33:23	JacolynDandreano	no, i can't stand gossip
2015-12-18 11:33:45	yama	ugh
2015-12-18 11:34:02	JacolynDandreano	i do my best to only talk about someone or a situation if i NEED to.  if it is going to be beneficial to the overall situation for me to vent, then i will
2015-12-18 11:34:47	yama	it is benefitial to my curiosity
2015-12-18 11:35:38	JacolynDandreano	anyway I'm probably going to spend a lot of time on it b/c they put A LOT of complaints into 30 paragraphs of messaging. I'm going to address them all. but i want to address them in a way that will diffuse the situation rather than escalate the tension.  on the other hand, i disagree with almost everything they said. so i need to choose my words carefully to be pointed but also respectful.
2015-12-18 11:36:03	JacolynDandreano	and the one variant factor is my emotions. that whenever i even think about the way they messaged me makes me mad
2015-12-18 11:36:38	JacolynDandreano	and i don't want to allow my anger to course rampantly through my message
2015-12-18 11:36:49	JacolynDandreano	so i need to take time to consider and then carefully write
2015-12-18 11:36:53	JacolynDandreano	lol

2015-12-18 12:45:09	JacolynDandreano	but I'm not sure how they smell b/c i don't think I've ever seen them
2015-12-18 12:45:24	JacolynDandreano	no reason to be jealous
2015-12-18 12:45:29	JacolynDandreano	we can share the doge
2015-12-18 12:46:04	JacolynDandreano	this fucking letter is going to be longer than the damn story i wrote you
2015-12-18 12:46:32	yama	there used to be a tree of jasmines in the house/workshop where my dad used to work, which was like a second house to me
2015-12-18 12:46:47	yama	well i'd be jealous of both you and the doge ;)

2015-12-18 13:25:02	JacolynDandreano	do you want to read my opening paragraph
2015-12-18 13:25:04	JacolynDandreano	?
2015-12-18 13:25:05	JacolynDandreano	:P
2015-12-18 13:25:09	yama	ok
2015-12-18 13:25:45	JacolynDandreano	all of those pictures are perfect
2015-12-18 13:25:49	JacolynDandreano	why do you not like it
2015-12-18 13:25:49	JacolynDandreano	why do you not like it
2015-12-18 13:25:49	JacolynDandreano	why do you not like it
2015-12-18 13:25:49	JacolynDandreano	why do you not like it
2015-12-18 13:26:21	JacolynDandreano	is that brick wall part of your house?
2015-12-18 13:26:34	JacolynDandreano	messy how
2015-12-18 13:27:24	JacolynDandreano	wait, how is that wall messy?
2015-12-18 13:30:43	JacolynDandreano	plants creeping up a wall is one of my favorite things.  that's not messy to me at all. the cement bit gives the house character, shows it is not a brand new house which is was cooler than having a boring new house  and i don't see any wire coming out.
2015-12-18 13:30:59	JacolynDandreano	but why IS there a random cement line lol
2015-12-18 13:31:03	JacolynDandreano	now I'm curious
2015-12-18 13:31:07	yama	there is like a shadow
2015-12-18 13:31:30	yama	because that's where the 2nd floor starts, it's supposed to be covered in a line of bricks too i guess
2015-12-18 13:31:38	yama	but the house is unfinished
2015-12-18 13:31:43	yama	it used to be a 1 floor house
2015-12-18 13:31:52	yama	and my parents expanded it and made it too big
2015-12-18 13:31:56	JacolynDandreano	see it gives character, tells a story
2015-12-18 13:32:06	JacolynDandreano	made the house too big?
2015-12-18 13:32:13	yama	that window you see leads to a room that is not finished
2015-12-18 13:32:23	JacolynDandreano	why don't you just finish it
2015-12-18 13:32:25	yama	ye, the story is: we didn't have enough money
2015-12-18 13:32:25	yama	lol
2015-12-18 13:32:26	JacolynDandreano	if you don't like it
2015-12-18 13:32:31	JacolynDandreano	oh
2015-12-18 13:32:43	JacolynDandreano	so why don't you just do little things at a time to finish it
2015-12-18 13:33:04	JacolynDandreano	tho i don't own a house so i wouldn't know how much it costs to do "little things"
2015-12-18 13:33:09	yama	cause it's expensive, not a priority, and it's very difficult to find a trust worthy builder
2015-12-18 13:33:13	yama	extremely difficult
2015-12-18 13:33:38	JacolynDandreano	yeah it is like that here too
2015-12-18 13:33:57	JacolynDandreano	well like everything that i saw
2015-12-18 13:34:01	JacolynDandreano	now show me the front
2015-12-18 13:34:27	yama	that is the front 
2015-12-18 13:34:34	yama	the lemon tree is in the back yard
2015-12-18 13:34:42	yama	and the basil plant
2015-12-18 13:36:15	JacolynDandreano	oh cool
2015-12-18 13:36:29	yama	idk what's up with that plant
2015-12-18 13:36:31	JacolynDandreano	do lemons grow green before they are ripe?
2015-12-18 13:36:42	yama	it was dying and i moved it and it started growing
2015-12-18 13:36:44	yama	yes
2015-12-18 13:36:53	yama	having a lemon tree is the best thing ever
2015-12-18 13:36:58	JacolynDandreano	maybe it wasnt getting the proper amount of sunlight
2015-12-18 13:37:06	yama	where's the letter btw
2015-12-18 13:37:24	JacolynDandreano	this is going to sound stupid, but I've only ever seen lemons that were yellow so i didn't know that they grew green first
2015-12-18 13:37:38	JacolynDandreano	i thought maybe the green ones were limes on a tree that blended in with the lemon tree
2015-12-18 13:37:39	JacolynDandreano	:P
2015-12-18 13:37:43	JacolynDandreano	what letter
2015-12-18 13:38:17	yama	hah
2015-12-18 13:38:34	yama	u said you wrote a paragraphs
2015-12-18 13:38:38	JacolynDandreano	oh
2015-12-18 13:38:47	JacolynDandreano	yeah i wasnt sure if you wanted to see my opening
2015-12-18 13:38:48	JacolynDandreano	:P
2015-12-18 13:38:54	JacolynDandreano	since you're so curious
2015-12-18 13:39:06	JacolynDandreano	im 2-3 paragraphs into addressing their first point now
2015-12-18 13:40:49	JacolynDandreano	Good Morning! Thank you for your patience in waiting for a response.  This is a fairly busy time for me both personally and professionally with Christmas approaching.
2015-12-18 13:40:49	JacolynDandreano	 
2015-12-18 13:40:49	JacolynDandreano	I suppose I should begin with my purpose for writing.  I believe I did mention previously that your compilation of complaints against me now, in particular, took me by surprise, as it should be apparent that I have distanced myself from the IRC community and its politics, having scarcely been active there for the past 1-2 months (barring occasional exceptions when I have been persuaded by visit requests).  I questioned
2015-12-18 13:40:49	JacolynDandreano	whether or not I even wanted to respond to it.  Since I no longer see myself an active member of the IRC community, it seemed that taking any significant amount of time to answer would be irrelevant.  On the other hand, though I have not talked with you enough to form a relationship beyond online acquaintance and therefore have no motive to repair a relationship that was never formed in the first place, compassion for any
2015-12-18 13:40:49	JacolynDandreano	individual that I have offended, regardless of my disagreement with their reasoning, prompted me to consent to offering my perspective as you requested.
2015-12-18 13:40:49	JacolynDandreano	 
2015-12-18 13:40:49	JacolynDandreano	I intend to address each complaint in the order it was written, so I apologize in advance if the structure of this message appears unorganized.  It is my desire and intention to diffuse this situation, rather than escalate any tension, so I am doing my best to carefully consider my words in the hope that they will be courteous in addition to being forthright and genuine.
2015-12-18 13:40:56	JacolynDandreano	there's my intro lol
2015-12-18 13:42:03	yama	i want to know what they said
2015-12-18 13:42:04	yama	ugh
2015-12-18 13:42:08	JacolynDandreano	lol
2015-12-18 13:42:29	JacolynDandreano	does my intro sound polite but also direct?
2015-12-18 13:44:06	JacolynDandreano	anything that is too rude there?
2015-12-18 13:44:10	JacolynDandreano	I'm doing my best
2015-12-18 13:44:28	yama	no
2015-12-18 13:44:38	yama	if it was me i'd make it way shorter
2015-12-18 13:44:44	yama	but then again if it was me i wouldn't reply
2015-12-18 13:44:54	yama	or if i did i'd be more rude
2015-12-18 13:44:58	yama	if it is who i think it is
2015-12-18 13:45:00	yama	:/
2015-12-18 13:46:02	JacolynDandreano	you wouldn't be rude, because you like them
2015-12-18 13:46:08	JacolynDandreano	is it too long tho
2015-12-18 13:46:48	JacolynDandreano	i want it to come across as cool-headed. Neither overflowing with passionate anger, nor consoling warmth
2015-12-18 13:47:05	yama	i like like 4 people in irc
2015-12-18 13:47:17	JacolynDandreano	well you named the five people you liked

2015-12-18 13:49:46	JacolynDandreano	i used to complain about it being too quiet, but i think we had a nicer community then
2015-12-18 13:49:50	JacolynDandreano	yes, of course
2015-12-18 13:49:57	JacolynDandreano	how is that even a question

2015-12-18 13:51:15	JacolynDandreano	:)
2015-12-18 13:51:25	JacolynDandreano	I'm only talking to you rn
2015-12-18 13:51:25	JacolynDandreano	I'm only talking to you rn
2015-12-18 13:51:25	JacolynDandreano	I'm only talking to you rn
2015-12-18 13:51:32	JacolynDandreano	well except for this letter
2015-12-18 13:51:32	JacolynDandreano	well except for this letter
2015-12-18 13:51:32	JacolynDandreano	well except for this letter
2015-12-18 13:51:38	JacolynDandreano	I'm finally moving on to point two
2015-12-18 13:51:40	JacolynDandreano	lol
2015-12-18 13:51:41	yama	that can mean that im the only one with enough free time :p
2015-12-18 13:51:58	JacolynDandreano	im 8 paragraphs in so far
2015-12-18 13:52:06	yama	lol
2015-12-18 13:52:07	JacolynDandreano	lol that's not what it means
2015-12-18 13:52:26	JacolynDandreano	i don't feel bad about making this long, because the person made theirs really long too
2015-12-18 13:52:34	JacolynDandreano	unless you think it is overkill
2015-12-18 13:52:53	JacolynDandreano	but id rather just say everything that needs to be said now so that i don't ever need to revisit this to say more
2015-12-18 13:53:53	yama	idk i don't want to think about it if i'll never know who this person is
2015-12-18 13:53:56	yama	it feels weird
2015-12-18 13:55:55	JacolynDandreano	i mean, we both already know who it is. just because i don't say it doesn't mean that you don't know.  but ill leave you alone about it now then. sorry to bother you. i just am really frustrated about the whole thing so i feel the need to narrate how I'm feeling while i write the letter
2015-12-18 13:56:28	yama	u dont bother me
2015-12-18 13:57:10	yama	if it's rhine, i thought you knew i don't like her anymore because i confronted her about changing nicks and pretending to be someone new and i think you were there when i said that
2015-12-18 13:57:38	yama	so i was taken aback when you said i liked this person cause i couldn't picture oberon or cummisar doing something like this
2015-12-18 13:58:14	yama	show me what you wrote so far
2015-12-18 13:58:20	yama	minus what you already showed me of course
2015-12-18 13:59:17	JacolynDandreano	im not going to show you it.  b/c I'm going to accuse this person of bringing private issues to other people for the sake of starting drama. and i can't do that if i am sharing private issues too
2015-12-18 13:59:25	JacolynDandreano	if she shares it with other people, then i will too
2015-12-18 13:59:32	JacolynDandreano	but rn I'm trying to diffuse it
2015-12-18 13:59:34	JacolynDandreano	dammit
2015-12-18 13:59:42	JacolynDandreano	you made me type a gender pronoun
2015-12-18 13:59:44	JacolynDandreano	:(
2015-12-18 13:59:46	JacolynDandreano	f u
2015-12-18 14:00:05	yama	but you already did show me a bit, so it doesn't matter if i see the rest
2015-12-18 14:00:09	yama	HA! :D
2015-12-18 14:00:12	JacolynDandreano	:(
2015-12-18 14:00:18	JacolynDandreano	im so annoyed with myself now
2015-12-18 14:00:26	JacolynDandreano	oh well. we can chalk that up to an honest mistake
2015-12-18 14:00:34	JacolynDandreano	and you can vouch for me that i didn't mean to say it
2015-12-18 14:00:41	JacolynDandreano	if i ever need a defense
2015-12-18 14:00:41	yama	is ok bb
2015-12-18 14:00:43	JacolynDandreano	:P
2015-12-18 14:00:50	yama	it's not like im gonna do anything
2015-12-18 14:00:55	yama	unless you ask me to
2015-12-18 14:01:05	JacolynDandreano	i wouldnt
2015-12-18 14:01:11	JacolynDandreano	im not trying to get people involved
2015-12-18 14:01:14	JacolynDandreano	unlike that person
2015-12-18 14:03:23	JacolynDandreano	I'm starting to get slightly sarcastic now. i think i am going to need to edit my paragraphs heavily
2015-12-18 14:04:11	yama	just keep writing
2015-12-18 14:04:12	yama	edit later
2015-12-18 14:04:36	JacolynDandreano	yeah i think i will do that
2015-12-18 14:04:37	yama	write the whole thing, unfiltered, let it rest, come back to it tomorrow or monday and edit it
2015-12-18 14:04:45	JacolynDandreano	i mean i edited my intro mostly.
2015-12-18 14:05:01	JacolynDandreano	just not these paragraphs which are very directly speaking to each point at a time
2015-12-18 14:20:24	JacolynDandreano	are you dead
2015-12-18 14:27:07	yama	i was reading a bit
2015-12-18 14:28:39	JacolynDandreano	reading what
2015-12-18 14:28:48	yama	heart of darkness
2015-12-18 14:28:53	JacolynDandreano	good
2015-12-18 14:29:05	JacolynDandreano	do you find the wording a little dense
2015-12-18 14:29:25	yama	i guess, tho not more than blood meridian
2015-12-18 14:29:34	yama	i feel like im reading moby dick
2015-12-18 14:29:45	yama	have you seen apocalypse now btw?
2015-12-18 14:30:16	JacolynDandreano	uh i don't think so
2015-12-18 14:30:29	yama	shame
2015-12-18 14:30:48	JacolynDandreano	s/eading moby/iding
2015-12-18 14:31:03	yama	hah
2015-12-18 14:31:10	JacolynDandreano	ugh im so sick of writing right now
2015-12-18 14:31:16	yama	i wouldnt know how that feels :)
2015-12-18 14:31:21	yama	stop then
2015-12-18 14:31:30	JacolynDandreano	I'm going to stop for lunch in 15 minutes
2015-12-18 14:31:34	JacolynDandreano	i just want this to be over
2015-12-18 14:31:47	JacolynDandreano	can you please just write more of my story
2015-12-18 14:31:56	JacolynDandreano	ill need a nice distraction when I'm done
2015-12-18 14:32:14	yama	fine but after i do hs workd
2015-12-18 14:32:16	yama	work
2015-12-18 14:32:20	JacolynDandreano	ok
2015-12-18 14:33:45	yama	i wish you were into films as you're into books
2015-12-18 14:35:19	JacolynDandreano	sorry. nothing comes close to my love of books. not even food
2015-12-18 14:38:32	yama	in a way im kinda jealous of people who mostly like just one form of art
2015-12-18 14:39:20	JacolynDandreano	why
2015-12-18 14:40:52	yama	because there's enough of just one form to be more than you can consume in a life time
2015-12-18 14:41:57	JacolynDandreano	i mean, i suppose i like experiencing art of other mediums, but i only like the pieces that speak to me as though they are telling a story, so even music or visual art is only enjoyed within the context of reading. it is just that i "read" the story in my head alongside experiencing the art
2015-12-18 14:42:29	JacolynDandreano	so, if i really like a painting, it is b/c there is some story waiting to get out of it
2015-12-18 14:42:42	JacolynDandreano	i suppose that doesn't make much sense.
2015-12-18 14:42:42	JacolynDandreano	i suppose that doesn't make much sense.
2015-12-18 14:42:42	JacolynDandreano	i suppose that doesn't make much sense.
2015-12-18 14:42:42	JacolynDandreano	i suppose that doesn't make much sense.
2015-12-18 14:42:55	yama	it does but it doesn't explain why you don't love movies as much
2015-12-18 14:44:54	JacolynDandreano	b/c movies don't allow me to use the same amount of imagination. they generally are stories that are very straightforward about the characters, plot, setting.  Some of the guesswork is taken out.
2015-12-18 14:45:23	JacolynDandreano	I suppose I really enjoy movies that are intriguing or imaginative enough to provoke more imagination in my mind
2015-12-18 14:46:44	JacolynDandreano	anyway, i really do like watching movies. I'm just a bit particular when i watch them, very critical of them too, and generally don't feel like i can connect to the characters or settings to the same degree that i connect to those in a book that forces you in some ways to use your imagination to connect them
2015-12-18 14:47:54	yama	it seems like you're talking about a particular kind of movies
2015-12-18 14:48:07	yama	cause some movies are extremely far from straight forward
2015-12-18 14:48:18	yama	and the majority of people find them boring or bad because of that
2015-12-18 14:49:35	JacolynDandreano	how would that be seen as boring
2015-12-18 14:49:40	yama	most people seem to have certain expectations about movies, and anything that's foreign to that is "bad" precisely because it requires the viewer to think beyond a simple plot
2015-12-18 14:50:17	yama	i don't know what examples to give you since i don't know if you've seen this type of movies
2015-12-18 14:50:19	JacolynDandreano	i guess
2015-12-18 14:50:28	JacolynDandreano	well just list a bunch
2015-12-18 14:50:30	JacolynDandreano	:)
2015-12-18 14:50:41	yama	old films, silent films, b&w films
2015-12-18 14:50:47	yama	foreign, slow, long films
2015-12-18 14:50:58	yama	or films without a clear plot
2015-12-18 14:51:03	JacolynDandreano	oh. no, i don't think I've seen those
2015-12-18 14:51:27	yama	I asked you about david lynch yesterday cause the dream sequences in windup bird reminded me of lynch
2015-12-18 14:51:47	JacolynDandreano	and you are right. i don't think id appreciate a movie without a clear plot. i can't appreciate movies for their artistic elements
2015-12-18 14:51:54	JacolynDandreano	the way that i can appreciate a book
2015-12-18 14:52:00	JacolynDandreano	so i guess you're right all along
2015-12-18 14:53:44	yama	it takes some mental "adjusting", just like reading books would to someone who never reads
2015-12-18 14:54:56	JacolynDandreano	i suppose
2015-12-18 15:14:42	yama	did you write more
2015-12-18 15:16:04	JacolynDandreano	yes
2015-12-18 15:16:08	JacolynDandreano	im prob halfway done
2015-12-18 15:18:41	JacolynDandreano	i want to just punch this person in the face and be done with it
2015-12-18 15:20:36	yama	do it
2015-12-18 15:20:50	yama	i'd do it but i don't want to hit a girl
2015-12-18 15:21:03	JacolynDandreano	maybe i said it was a girl to throw you off the scent
2015-12-18 15:22:29	yama	nope you won't fool me
2015-12-18 15:25:19	JacolynDandreano	:( i tried at least to conceal it
2015-12-18 15:25:27	JacolynDandreano	so who is your top 4 now?
2015-12-18 15:26:33	yama	will you tell me yours?
2015-12-18 15:26:39	JacolynDandreano	sure
2015-12-18 15:26:47	JacolynDandreano	not in any order of course
2015-12-18 15:26:51	JacolynDandreano	and it may need to be later
2015-12-18 15:27:02	JacolynDandreano	b/c i really want to finish this before the end of my life
2015-12-18 15:27:11	yama	i dont think there's any surprises tho
2015-12-18 15:27:25	JacolynDandreano	eh you said it changed
2015-12-18 15:27:34	yama	antranik, oberon, cum, marko, i guess
2015-12-18 15:27:47	JacolynDandreano	i didn't make top 4?
2015-12-18 15:27:47	JacolynDandreano	i didn't make top 4?
2015-12-18 15:27:47	JacolynDandreano	i didn't make top 4?
2015-12-18 15:27:51	JacolynDandreano	am i fifth?
2015-12-18 15:27:53	yama	you're not in irc!
2015-12-18 15:27:55	JacolynDandreano	are yours in order
2015-12-18 15:28:10	JacolynDandreano	i meant "people you know from the chan"
2015-12-18 15:28:10	yama	no, just cause you won't give me in order
2015-12-18 15:28:21	yama	well ye you too then
2015-12-18 15:28:31	yama	did yours change?
2015-12-18 15:28:32	JacolynDandreano	ok whew
2015-12-18 15:34:30	JacolynDandreano	I'm about to backhandedly compare them to better nick and beaky
2015-12-18 15:38:21	yama	hah
2015-12-18 15:38:26	yama	but beaky
2015-12-18 15:38:27	yama	:(
2015-12-18 15:38:32	JacolynDandreano	i know
2015-12-18 15:38:36	JacolynDandreano	i actually like both of those people
2015-12-18 15:38:49	JacolynDandreano	but I'm not saying anything bad
2015-12-18 15:39:01	JacolynDandreano	just making the comparison
2015-12-18 15:39:07	yama	beaky never started any drama tho
2015-12-18 15:39:11	yama	bn did
2015-12-18 15:39:15	JacolynDandreano	im not saying they did
2015-12-18 15:39:19	JacolynDandreano	it is about something else
2015-12-18 15:39:26	JacolynDandreano	eh ill just tell you this one part
2015-12-18 15:40:49	JacolynDandreano	As you stated, we knew the nicks almost right away.  Like I told you in previous conversations, this is because you generally have a distinct way of speaking (which seemed troll-like until you explained why you talk that way).  There have been plenty of people that have a distinct way of speaking in the chan.  I don’t think you were around for people like BetterNick and Beaky, but when they spoke, we knew who it was
2015-12-18 15:40:49	JacolynDandreano	right away, even if they had changed their nicks.  We already discussed all of this. I thought it was resolved, so you including this now leads me to believe that you were insincere in agreeing that it was.
2015-12-18 15:40:51	JacolynDandreano	there
2015-12-18 15:40:56	JacolynDandreano	I've given you one paragraph
2015-12-18 15:41:04	JacolynDandreano	and now you know for sure who i am talking about
2015-12-18 15:42:02	yama	ye
2015-12-18 15:43:34	JacolynDandreano	anything in that paragraph sound bad? lol
2015-12-18 15:44:33	yama	no
2015-12-18 15:45:12	yama	but i'd like to read the rest
2015-12-18 15:45:31	JacolynDandreano	eh you won't read all of it yet
2015-12-18 15:46:11	JacolynDandreano	but maybe i should include this next paragraph. b/c I'm trying to think of a way to say "you're vain and the world doesn't revolve around you" without being so mean about it
2015-12-18 15:46:33	yama	haha
2015-12-18 15:46:50	JacolynDandreano	ok ill show you this next one in a sec
2015-12-18 15:47:05	yama	ty
2015-12-18 15:47:58	JacolynDandreano	ugh i feel dumber for even addressing these points germán
2015-12-18 15:48:14	JacolynDandreano	like why am i even validating them enough to formulate a response
2015-12-18 15:48:19	JacolynDandreano	i should just tell her that instead
2015-12-18 15:48:33	yama	i have no idea, i told you you should ignore her 3 days ago
2015-12-18 15:49:04	JacolynDandreano	next paragraph: Your next point is that you think that by being friends with people from the chan, that you were taking away my friendship with them.  I understand that friendships evolve, and I’m fine with some of mine changing. It isn’t like I expected to be 85 years old eventually and still be friends with every person who chatted online with me.  However, I think it is odd that you assumed you (or any one person)
2015-12-18 15:49:04	JacolynDandreano	were so important to all of us that you could change friendships.  If they are that easily changed, then they aren’t valuable friendships in the first place, and I’m fine with letting them go.
2015-12-18 15:59:09	JacolynDandreano	and i wrote my ending paragraphs now. before i finished the middle...
2015-12-18 15:59:19	JacolynDandreano	ill show you those too, so you can tell me if they are too mean
2015-12-18 15:59:21	JacolynDandreano	be honest
2015-12-18 15:59:27	yama	oks
2015-12-18 15:59:40	JacolynDandreano	tho you haven't commented on the paragraph above
2015-12-18 15:59:46	JacolynDandreano	did you think THAT was bad?
2015-12-18 15:59:51	JacolynDandreano	Though I’m sure you will be disappointed with my response, especially since it does not perpetuate drama, I do hope that you will take into consideration the amount of time and energy I have poured into this.  It was certainly more than it deserved.  I am willing to discuss this further in (hopefully) much more brevity on both of our sides, but I absolutely refuse to be dragged into additional drama or arguments related
2015-12-18 15:59:51	JacolynDandreano	to this.  If you are uninterested in diffusing this tension, then I am uninterested in further discussion and will kindly ask you to respect the distance that I have placed between myself and IRC politics.
2015-12-18 15:59:51	JacolynDandreano	 
2015-12-18 15:59:51	JacolynDandreano	Though your timing is, in my opinion, quite inconsiderate, I DO appreciate you eventually bringing this all to my attention since you were still stewing over it.  It is my sincere hope that we can move past this to a neutral, mutual respect for each other.
2015-12-18 15:59:51	JacolynDandreano	 
2015-12-18 15:59:51	JacolynDandreano	Yours in fitness,
2015-12-18 15:59:51	JacolynDandreano	 
2015-12-18 15:59:51	JacolynDandreano	Jacolyn
2015-12-18 16:01:09	yama	hahahah
2015-12-18 16:01:27	JacolynDandreano	the last part was b/c sankaku begged me to end it with that
2015-12-18 16:01:32	JacolynDandreano	tho he doesn't know who I'm talking to
2015-12-18 16:01:45	JacolynDandreano	just that I'm writing a long letter to some rude person from the chan
2015-12-18 16:01:52	JacolynDandreano	do you think it is bad to end it that way
2015-12-18 16:02:05	yama	it's hilarios and it makes seem like you're trolling
2015-12-18 16:02:13	yama	have you considered maybe she's still trolling?
2015-12-18 16:02:26	JacolynDandreano	yes i think she is a fucking troll
2015-12-18 16:02:32	JacolynDandreano	but she got mad at me calling her that
2015-12-18 16:02:40	yama	then why are you responding
2015-12-18 16:02:43	JacolynDandreano	anyway even if she is, it isn't like I'm going to waste more time on her
2015-12-18 16:02:47	JacolynDandreano	I'm writing this one response
2015-12-18 16:02:49	JacolynDandreano	and thats it
2015-12-18 16:03:31	yama	fine
2015-12-18 16:03:36	yama	i think it's more than she deservers
2015-12-18 16:03:49	JacolynDandreano	well.... that's what i put in the conclusion
2015-12-18 16:03:54	JacolynDandreano	do you think any of it is rude
2015-12-18 16:03:59	yama	no
2015-12-18 16:04:26	yama	i think the whole thing is dumb and not worthy of your time
2015-12-18 16:04:37	yama	what did m092 say
2015-12-18 16:04:42	JacolynDandreano	do you think I'm dumb for writing it
2015-12-18 16:04:49	JacolynDandreano	how do you know it was m092
2015-12-18 16:04:52	JacolynDandreano	did i say that too
2015-12-18 16:04:58	yama	i read your mind
2015-12-18 16:05:02	JacolynDandreano	lol
2015-12-18 16:07:24	JacolynDandreano	now I'm saying this: I DIDN’T think I was one of the guys. I have two big boobs and curvy hips which daily remind me I’m very much a girl.
2015-12-18 16:07:54	yama	hahah

2015-12-18 16:31:47	yama	i guess you listen to him more
2015-12-18 16:31:47	JacolynDandreano	you both did
2015-12-18 16:31:56	JacolynDandreano	anyway I'm going to write this...  I believe I did mention previously that your compilation of complaints against me now, in particular, took me by surprise, as it should be apparent that I have distanced myself from the IRC community and its politics, having scarcely been active there for the past 1-2 months (barring occasional exceptions when I have been persuaded by visit requests).  I questioned whether or not I even
2015-12-18 16:31:56	JacolynDandreano	wanted to respond to it.  Since I no longer see myself an active member of the IRC community, it seems that taking any significant amount of time to answer would be irrelevant.  I have no interest in drama, so please don't contact me again.
2015-12-18 16:32:03	JacolynDandreano	it is a spliced version of my intro
2015-12-18 16:33:30	JacolynDandreano	i don't listen to him more
2015-12-18 16:33:59	JacolynDandreano	you mostly talked me into it all day. and then i told him something that worried me about not responding
2015-12-18 16:34:05	JacolynDandreano	and he made me feel better about it
2015-12-18 16:52:18	JacolynDandreano	did you die germán
2015-12-18 16:58:44	yama	sry i was stretching

2015-12-18 16:59:01	yama	did you respond then
2015-12-18 16:59:05	JacolynDandreano	yes

2015-12-18 16:59:33	yama	what did she say
2015-12-18 16:59:35	JacolynDandreano	the paragraph
2015-12-18 16:59:37	JacolynDandreano	nothing

2015-12-18 20:24:50	JacolynDandreano	um I had a hard time following what happened with the villain and the knife polishing thing
2015-12-18 20:24:53	JacolynDandreano	and the kids
2015-12-18 20:25:45	JacolynDandreano	also, I'm annoyed that the bwf chat group added me back to talk about rhine
2015-12-18 20:25:54	JacolynDandreano	i feel like they were all talking about me
2015-12-18 20:25:59	yama	he "persuaded" his way into a house and it's implied he's gonna kill them
2015-12-18 20:26:12	JacolynDandreano	Ok that's what I thought
2015-12-18 20:26:12	JacolynDandreano	Ok that's what I thought
2015-12-18 20:26:12	JacolynDandreano	Ok that's what I thought
2015-12-18 20:26:12	JacolynDandreano	Ok that's what I thought
2015-12-18 20:26:26	yama	i don't think i like anyone from that crowd except yaad and suber
2015-12-18 20:26:33	yama	if yaad is one of them now, i guess
2015-12-18 20:26:34	JacolynDandreano	i don't like suber
2015-12-18 20:26:38	yama	i know lol
2015-12-18 20:26:41	JacolynDandreano	i think she is fake as hell
2015-12-18 20:26:45	JacolynDandreano	a flirt
2015-12-18 20:27:38	yama	im pretty sure i've seen you flirt more than her ;p
2015-12-18 20:27:46	JacolynDandreano	and I think she secretly likes when the guys act all macho and "fight" because they like her
2015-12-18 20:27:59	JacolynDandreano	flirt how
2015-12-18 20:28:04	JacolynDandreano	i make jokes
2015-12-18 20:28:09	JacolynDandreano	which I think is diff
2015-12-18 20:28:19	JacolynDandreano	and the guys don't act diff around me
2015-12-18 20:28:36	yama	do you want to watch ep 3
2015-12-18 20:28:46	JacolynDandreano	and if people do, it is only because I actually go out of my way to be friendly and nice and welcoming
2015-12-18 20:29:12	JacolynDandreano	not because I know how to mindlessly giggle at everything they say
2015-12-18 20:29:18	JacolynDandreano	oh shit
2015-12-18 20:29:20	JacolynDandreano	im sorry

2015-12-18 20:30:30	JacolynDandreano	but I'm gonna keep my mouth shut
2015-12-18 20:30:34	yama	is that why you'll pause?
2015-12-18 20:30:39	yama	you can vent
2015-12-18 20:30:42	JacolynDandreano	some things are better left unsaid
2015-12-18 20:30:47	yama	say it
2015-12-18 20:30:56	JacolynDandreano	no I'm not going to be mean
2015-12-18 20:31:04	JacolynDandreano	britt didn't technically do anything to me
2015-12-18 20:31:21	JacolynDandreano	so she doesn't deserve me saying anything bad about her
2015-12-18 20:31:35	yama	i just don't say anything cause i disagree
2015-12-18 20:31:48	JacolynDandreano	and if I do share, it is only because being a little buzzed has made me slightly less close-lipped
2015-12-18 20:31:57	yama	she's never been rude or stirred up drama, so that's ok in my book
2015-12-18 20:31:57	JacolynDandreano	disagree with what
2015-12-18 20:32:07	JacolynDandreano	i don't think she has either
2015-12-18 20:32:10	yama	that she's fake
2015-12-18 20:32:16	JacolynDandreano	Oh
2015-12-18 20:32:20	JacolynDandreano	well whatever
2015-12-18 20:32:26	JacolynDandreano	i shouldn't have said that

2015-12-18 20:32:33	JacolynDandreano	im an idiot
2015-12-18 20:32:35	yama	if i had to compare her with someone it'd be marko
2015-12-18 20:32:59	yama	cause i notice that they both remember things i say and ask me about them, and are encouraging
2015-12-18 20:33:03	JacolynDandreano	Uh so just two potheads....
2015-12-18 20:33:06	JacolynDandreano	oh

2015-12-18 20:42:40	JacolynDandreano	Well I just don't like her mostly because people act weird around her and basically stopped talking to me once she joined the pic

2015-12-18 20:54:57	JacolynDandreano	I didn't say it was. Just that I think she encourages it sometimes
2015-12-18 20:55:06	JacolynDandreano	anyway I don't want to talk about that

2015-12-18 21:31:12	yama	i don't know how it's called, when your eyes get used to the dark, and you turn on the light and you become too sensitive and "lose" the sight in the dark. Red light helps avoid that
2015-12-18 21:31:29	JacolynDandreano	Intersting
2015-12-18 21:31:34	JacolynDandreano	Did you make that up

2015-12-18 22:11:52	JacolynDandreano	idk
2015-12-18 22:12:03	yama	why would i be??
2015-12-18 22:12:05	JacolynDandreano	i feel like I've been particularly annoying today
2015-12-18 22:12:36	JacolynDandreano	Lol foil all over the window
2015-12-18 22:13:13	yama	nah
2015-12-18 22:13:58	yama	my curiosity's been satisfied so i liked that
2015-12-18 22:14:11	JacolynDandreano	Curiosity about what
2015-12-18 22:14:17	JacolynDandreano	who was bothering me?
2015-12-18 22:14:26	yama	she wearing her mr robot costume
2015-12-18 22:14:28	yama	ye
2015-12-18 22:16:49	JacolynDandreano	That was so obvious
2015-12-18 22:16:53	JacolynDandreano	silly girl
2015-12-18 22:18:04	JacolynDandreano	Want to know an insight into my mind that I don't share with many people? I feel really horrible when I talk too much. Because I like keeping everything in my mind. And if I ever say anything that maybe I don't mean or shows people how I am actually feeling, i feel somehow bad
2015-12-18 22:18:46	yama	yes i always want to know insights into your mind
2015-12-18 22:18:52	JacolynDandreano	so I think that is why I get paranoid about being annoying when I'm buzzed. Because I worry that I will say something and people will see a small part of Jacolyn that is stupid
2015-12-18 22:19:13	yama	and i also like knowing things that no one else does 
2015-12-18 22:19:26	JacolynDandreano	Sometimes when I spend time with friends and I'm too chatty, I get a really guilty feeling
2015-12-18 22:19:27	yama	u should know me better than that, i won't think you're stupid
2015-12-18 22:19:40	JacolynDandreano	it is rare that I talk enough for it to happen, but sometimes I do
2015-12-18 22:20:12	JacolynDandreano	But maybe you will
2015-12-18 22:20:20	JacolynDandreano	im surprised you don't already think that
2015-12-18 22:20:25	yama	no
2015-12-18 22:20:33	yama	i guess yoiu don't know me that well then
2015-12-18 22:20:48	yama	ugh i want to see his face
2015-12-18 22:21:03	JacolynDandreano	uh oh

2015-12-18 22:22:30	JacolynDandreano	He looks less intimidating than I thought
2015-12-18 22:24:08	JacolynDandreano	Oh that scared me
2015-12-18 22:24:39	yama	what did
2015-12-18 22:24:42	yama	the grab?
2015-12-18 22:24:48	JacolynDandreano	The stair thinf
2015-12-18 22:24:49	JacolynDandreano	g
2015-12-18 22:24:51	JacolynDandreano	yes
2015-12-18 22:24:59	JacolynDandreano	i jumped
2015-12-18 22:25:13	yama	he's not an intimidator, he's a "pusher"
2015-12-18 22:25:25	JacolynDandreano	I suppose
2015-12-18 22:25:45	JacolynDandreano	were your surprised by the grab
2015-12-18 22:25:46	yama	where does he keep all these young dudes..
2015-12-18 22:26:01	JacolynDandreano	I his lair I guess
2015-12-18 22:26:05	JacolynDandreano	In
2015-12-18 22:26:45	JacolynDandreano	I'm scared
2015-12-18 22:26:53	JacolynDandreano	something is going to pop out
2015-12-18 22:27:14	yama	dont hide under the blanket
2015-12-18 22:27:21	JacolynDandreano	I'm watching
2015-12-18 22:27:37	JacolynDandreano	but I have the blanket up to just under eyes
2015-12-18 22:27:40	JacolynDandreano	:)
2015-12-18 22:27:54	JacolynDandreano	Wow such stalker
2015-12-18 22:32:43	yama	intrigue
2015-12-18 22:32:51	JacolynDandreano	Ye
2015-12-18 22:32:56	yama	this makes me wonder
2015-12-18 22:33:06	yama	if this will be renewed for more seasons
2015-12-18 22:33:13	JacolynDandreano	if the villain is only a semi-villain
2015-12-18 22:33:15	yama	cause it's seems it's already explained most of the backstory
2015-12-18 22:33:16	JacolynDandreano	oh
2015-12-18 22:33:18	yama	no
2015-12-18 22:33:18	yama	why?
2015-12-18 22:33:20	JacolynDandreano	Yeah
2015-12-18 22:33:27	JacolynDandreano	because it is too easy
2015-12-18 22:33:43	yama	i think it's him
2015-12-18 22:34:00	JacolynDandreano	shows like this seem to add a bigger player who is the real person controlling the reasons for the initial villain
2015-12-18 22:34:11	JacolynDandreano	but I'm just suspicious I guess
2015-12-18 22:35:17	JacolynDandreano	Are you going to watch your movie now
2015-12-18 22:35:42	yama	maybe, my friends wanted to play a game
2015-12-18 22:36:04	yama	do you want me to download the next ep?
2015-12-18 22:36:13	JacolynDandreano	Sure

2015-12-18 22:39:42	JacolynDandreano	I feel silly for everything that happened today
2015-12-18 22:39:46	JacolynDandreano	from start to finish
2015-12-18 22:39:56	yama	i thought alcohol was supposed to deal with that:p
2015-12-18 22:40:10	yama	you're giving it more importance than it has
2015-12-18 22:40:43	JacolynDandreano	Like I told you before. Alcohol makes me more paranoid I guess

2015-12-18 22:48:55	JacolynDandreano	he didn't say he was interested either
2015-12-18 22:49:02	JacolynDandreano	just an overall impression I got
2015-12-18 22:50:39	JacolynDandreano	Btw, one of the last things I said to phi was "enjoy your mother's teet"
2015-12-18 22:50:52	JacolynDandreano	I think he will be furious with me

2015-12-18 22:53:56	JacolynDandreano	Because I'm buzzed iguess
2015-12-18 22:54:11	JacolynDandreano	he said he didn't have milk to drink. He normally drinks milk before bed
2015-12-18 22:54:11	JacolynDandreano	he said he didn't have milk to drink. He normally drinks milk before bed
2015-12-18 22:54:11	JacolynDandreano	he said he didn't have milk to drink. He normally drinks milk before bed
2015-12-18 22:54:31	JacolynDandreano	so I was buzzed and said "enjoy your milk" when he was going to bed
2015-12-18 22:54:43	JacolynDandreano	and he said THERE IS NO MILK
2015-12-18 22:54:56	JacolynDandreano	and I responded with "enjoy your mother's teet"
2015-12-18 22:55:06	JacolynDandreano	I think teet is really teat maybe

2015-12-18 23:59:24	yama	ok ill be done quick then
2015-12-18 23:59:33	JacolynDandreano	:(
2015-12-19 00:13:17	yama	you get out of the tub and dry yourself, and you put the pajamas back on, since it's now too late to go out and explore your surroundings. Your stomach starts rumbling and you recall that when you explored the house, the kitchen looked nice and inviting. You head towards it and see there's a bowl of fresh fruit and you make some juice, and you get a donnut from a box that just happens to be
2015-12-19 00:13:17	yama	there. Satisfied, you go back to bed and sleep deeply and undisturbed. The next morning you wake up with a similar feeling as the day before, almost as if it was the same day all over again. A quick trip downstairs shows you that it's a new day, as you see one of the windows has been shattered from the outside. Nervously you grab a knife from the kitchen and you check the rest of the house but
2015-12-19 00:13:17	yama	nothing else seems disturbed. There is no time to lose, you grab some warm winter clothes, and slip the knife into a pocket and you firmly walk towards the front door. However, when you're standing under the doorway looking outside, a curious thought stops you, making you turn on your heels and run back upstairs, into the bedroom, and crouch on the carpet to pick up the necklace, which you put
2015-12-19 00:13:17	yama	on and somehow you feel safer. The snow has thinned and the sun is high up on its zenith as you walk away from the house and closer into the forest surrounding it
2015-12-19 00:15:12	JacolynDandreano	Wow you are really good at this
2015-12-19 00:15:24	JacolynDandreano	im embarrassed that you read my crap story now

2015-12-20 17:06:04	yama	well it's not like i'm a professional teacher
2015-12-20 17:06:12	yama	and i don't charge her much
2015-12-20 17:06:26	yama	actually i set a price and she thought it was too low
2015-12-20 17:06:55	JacolynDandreano	Lol well that was nice of you
2015-12-20 17:08:36	JacolynDandreano	Is this girl like the girl from my story? :P

2015-12-20 17:15:16	yama	that would be improbable

2015-12-22 11:31:12	JacolynDandreano	i just don't know how to do it
2015-12-22 11:32:03	yama	it's easy! if it says 70% water and 3% salt, and you have a kg of flour that's 700g of water and 30g of salt
2015-12-22 11:32:25	JacolynDandreano	uh
2015-12-22 11:33:20	JacolynDandreano	perhaps it is also b/c I'm not used to seeing metric measurements
2015-12-22 11:33:35	JacolynDandreano	except when i measure food for my lunches
2015-12-22 11:33:37	yama	lame
2015-12-22 11:33:42	yama	stupid cups
2015-12-22 11:33:43	yama	should die
2015-12-22 11:34:14	JacolynDandreano	lol
2015-12-22 11:34:30	JacolynDandreano	i mean i have a scale, so I'm fine with measuring with grams
2015-12-22 11:34:45	yama	so you're just a LAZY american
2015-12-22 11:34:48	JacolynDandreano	it is just harder for me to picture what 700g would look like
2015-12-22 11:34:56	JacolynDandreano	yes, thank you for insulting me
2015-12-22 11:35:16	yama	that's why there are masuring cups and scales
2015-12-22 11:35:20	yama	you don't need to picture it
2015-12-22 11:35:30	JacolynDandreano	i like being able to picture it!
2015-12-22 11:35:41	yama	it servers no purpose
2015-12-22 11:35:49	JacolynDandreano	like i no longer need to measure out certain ingredients b/c i know them by eye
2015-12-22 11:36:03	JacolynDandreano	so things like salt and vanilla and herbs i just measure by eye
2015-12-22 11:36:36	JacolynDandreano	tho i suppose those are less important to get perfectly than flour
2015-12-22 11:37:22	yama	what if you had to make very different quantities
2015-12-22 11:37:31	yama	like suddenly you have to make it for 50 people
2015-12-22 11:38:24	yama	ugh i can't decide which bread to make
2015-12-22 11:40:28	JacolynDandreano	oh they have a tutorial on baker's math
2015-12-22 11:40:28	JacolynDandreano	oh they have a tutorial on baker's math
2015-12-22 11:40:32	JacolynDandreano	perhaps i should read it
2015-12-22 11:40:52	JacolynDandreano	have you ever made bread?
2015-12-22 11:41:04	yama	yes, i made the no knead bread years ago
2015-12-22 11:41:27	yama	i guess making pizza dough is similar enough
2015-12-22 11:41:42	yama	but im surprised im not seeing any mention of cold rising
2015-12-22 11:42:16	JacolynDandreano	cold rising is not always typical
2015-12-22 11:42:32	JacolynDandreano	most breads I've made had recipes that just call for the typical rises
2015-12-22 11:42:46	JacolynDandreano	in a warm dark place
2015-12-22 11:43:20	JacolynDandreano	ugh this math stuff is confusing
2015-12-22 11:43:28	yama	how is it confusing
2015-12-22 11:43:31	JacolynDandreano	it just is
2015-12-22 11:43:34	JacolynDandreano	i don't like math
2015-12-22 11:43:44	JacolynDandreano	i see numbers and my brain decides it won't cooperate
2015-12-22 11:44:01	yama	get an amount of flour, X, now get the % of X that's required of every element
2015-12-22 11:44:04	JacolynDandreano	i have no idea how i got perfect scores in my college math classes
2015-12-22 11:44:05	yama	just do 1kg of flour
2015-12-22 11:44:21	yama	and that makes everything super easy, you can calculate in your head
2015-12-22 11:44:21	JacolynDandreano	what if i want to do more than 1kg of flour
2015-12-22 11:44:29	yama	how much
2015-12-22 11:44:31	yama	give me a number
2015-12-22 11:44:36	JacolynDandreano	this says that flour is always at 100%
2015-12-22 11:44:50	yama	give me a number of kg of flour that you want to make
2015-12-22 11:46:32	JacolynDandreano	well i don't know
2015-12-22 11:46:38	JacolynDandreano	this is confusing
2015-12-22 11:46:40	JacolynDandreano	i feel dumb
2015-12-22 11:46:43	JacolynDandreano	b/c this is basic math
2015-12-22 11:46:45	yama	wat
2015-12-22 11:46:49	JacolynDandreano	i could have done this in 7th grade
2015-12-22 11:46:51	yama	i am asking you to make up a number
2015-12-22 11:46:56	JacolynDandreano	ok 3
2015-12-22 11:46:59	yama	ok
2015-12-22 11:47:11	yama	and what % of water does the recipe call for?
2015-12-22 11:47:38	yama	or do you want me to do it with my regular pizza proportions?
2015-12-22 11:52:16	JacolynDandreano	sure
2015-12-22 11:52:28	JacolynDandreano	let's say i want to make it 70% wet
2015-12-22 11:52:34	JacolynDandreano	what the fuck does that even mean
2015-12-22 11:52:36	JacolynDandreano	lol
2015-12-22 11:52:58	yama	ok
2015-12-22 11:53:02	yama	you go to google
2015-12-22 11:53:23	yama	and you search for "70% of 3000" (because 3kg is 3000g)
2015-12-22 11:53:24	yama	https://www.google.com.ar/search?q=70%25+of+3000&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&gws_rd=cr&ei=xGN5VpzpAcqJwgSby4SABQ
2015-12-22 11:53:53	yama	so, 2100 is 70% of 3000, that means you'll put 3kg of flour and 2.1kg of water
2015-12-22 11:54:04	yama	rather, 2.1l, which is close enough
2015-12-22 11:58:35	JacolynDandreano	ok
2015-12-22 11:58:35	JacolynDandreano	ok
2015-12-22 11:58:41	JacolynDandreano	that makes sense i suppose
2015-12-22 11:59:25	yama	:)
2015-12-22 11:59:38	JacolynDandreano	i should try to find a recipe to practice on
2015-12-22 11:59:45	yama	yes
2015-12-22 11:59:50	yama	pizza ;)
2015-12-22 11:59:59	JacolynDandreano	lol
2015-12-22 12:00:06	JacolynDandreano	i mean just the recipe. not to actually make it
2015-12-22 12:00:08	JacolynDandreano	:P
2015-12-22 12:00:12	yama	:(
2015-12-22 12:01:59	yama	im hungry now
2015-12-22 12:02:06	yama	i guess i'll just make any bread
2015-12-22 12:10:05	JacolynDandreano	make french bread
2015-12-22 12:10:13	JacolynDandreano	i love french bread
2015-12-22 12:10:24	JacolynDandreano	do you have the options narrowed down?
2015-12-22 12:10:28	JacolynDandreano	i can choose for you
2015-12-22 12:10:40	yama	just make it for me
2015-12-22 12:10:55	yama	i was never a fan of baguettes
2015-12-22 12:11:00	yama	but maybe home made is better
2015-12-22 12:11:06	yama	choose for me
2015-12-22 12:17:24	JacolynDandreano	i already said id make it for you
2015-12-22 12:17:42	JacolynDandreano	...if you outfit your dungeon with a blanket, chaise lounge, and books
2015-12-22 12:17:57	yama	but i need it for christmas
2015-12-22 12:18:01	JacolynDandreano	b/c i need to keep busy during rising times

2015-12-22 14:32:07	JacolynDandreano	you didn't give me the options you're considering
2015-12-22 14:32:23	JacolynDandreano	what if i pick one and you don't like the style or you don't have the ingredients
2015-12-22 16:49:35	yama	i don't know names of breads
2015-12-22 16:49:42	yama	something without too many ingredients
2015-12-22 16:49:51	yama	i believe in mastering the basics before i mess with adding stuff
2015-12-22 16:58:35	yama	meh just give me one that you think will go with sandwiches 
2015-12-22 16:59:04	yama	http://www.thefreshloaf.com/lessons/addingmore this one looks good but it uses cups -_-
2015-12-22 17:03:24	JacolynDandreano	but you don't want a soft crust right
2015-12-22 17:03:56	yama	idk, i don't think i can be too picky since I don't have much experience
2015-12-22 17:04:21	yama	just something with nice texture that can hold together a decent sandwich
2015-12-22 17:06:13	JacolynDandreano	b/c those are two very different breads
2015-12-22 17:06:34	yama	which two?
2015-12-22 17:06:42	JacolynDandreano	https://themeathouseblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/italian-sandwich_13499368.jpg
2015-12-22 17:06:43		[ http://is.gd/6DM589 ]
2015-12-22 17:07:17	JacolynDandreano	those two ^
2015-12-22 17:07:23	JacolynDandreano	b/c the second one is more ike sandwich bread
2015-12-22 17:08:04	yama	that's nice
2015-12-22 17:08:18	JacolynDandreano	which one were you thinking of...
2015-12-22 17:08:33	yama	I DONT KNOW
2015-12-22 17:08:35	yama	:(
2015-12-22 17:09:14	JacolynDandreano	omg
2015-12-22 17:11:02	yama	how is that one made?
2015-12-22 17:11:16	JacolynDandreano	the second one?
2015-12-22 17:11:25	yama	yes
2015-12-22 17:11:58	JacolynDandreano	http://www.thefreshloaf.com/handbook/whole-wheat-sourdough-sandwich-bread
2015-12-22 17:11:58		[ http://is.gd/rlyQpD ]
2015-12-22 17:12:07	JacolynDandreano	that's one for a whole wheat loaf
2015-12-22 17:12:23	JacolynDandreano	i have never baked with whole wheat flour so i don't know how good the recipe is
2015-12-22 17:29:25	yama	i thought you said you made all kinds of bread
2015-12-22 17:30:14	JacolynDandreano	i have made a nice variety, but I've only done white breads.
2015-12-22 17:30:32	JacolynDandreano	and I'm not the most experienced baker either
2015-12-22 17:30:40	JacolynDandreano	just that I like trying new ones
2015-12-22 18:16:00	yama	water OR milk?
2015-12-22 18:16:10	yama	i don't have honey :(
2015-12-22 18:16:18	yama	nor unsalted butter, only salted
2015-12-22 18:38:38	JacolynDandreano	If you have salted butter then just don't add much salt if the recipes called for it
2015-12-22 18:39:00	JacolynDandreano	and I bet you could just substitute a little sugar for the honey. The honey is just mixed in right?
2015-12-22 18:41:55	--	irc: disconnected from server
2015-12-22 22:22:29	JacolynDandreano	Do you type more English or Spanish throughout the day
2015-12-22 22:23:19	yama	what do you think ;)
2015-12-22 22:23:19	--	[JacolynDandreano] is away: Offline

2015-12-22 22:27:25	JacolynDandreano	dont forget to write more afterward
2015-12-22 22:27:26	JacolynDandreano	pls
2015-12-22 22:29:47	yama	what things
2015-12-22 22:32:05	JacolynDandreano	I've got to clean my kitchen
2015-12-22 22:32:44	JacolynDandreano	hey, how would you feel if you were dating a girl and you found out she used to be a man but had gotten the procedures and switched to being a female
2015-12-22 22:33:12	JacolynDandreano	i just read an article on Bruce Jenner turning into Caitlyn :P
2015-12-22 22:33:19	yama	uhhh very weird
2015-12-22 22:33:36	yama	and fooled
2015-12-22 22:33:40	yama	that's not the word
2015-12-22 22:33:42	JacolynDandreano	Would you find that a turnoff
2015-12-22 22:33:46	yama	yes
2015-12-22 22:33:54	JacolynDandreano	would you stop dating them
2015-12-22 22:34:07	yama	yes probably
2015-12-22 22:34:11	JacolynDandreano	even tho they now have boobs and a vagina
2015-12-22 22:34:19	JacolynDandreano	and sound like a girl
2015-12-22 22:34:25	JacolynDandreano	and have a big butt
2015-12-22 22:34:29	JacolynDandreano	and long hair
2015-12-22 22:34:53	yama	are you looking for a loophole to technically call me homo
2015-12-22 22:35:16	JacolynDandreano	Ha no
2015-12-22 22:35:20	JacolynDandreano	i was wondering
2015-12-22 22:35:49	JacolynDandreano	because some straight people wouldn't care I think. But I wouldn't be able to be with someone who was previously a girl and became a guy
2015-12-22 22:36:52	JacolynDandreano	and I can't imagine being 100% straight and not finding that too weird
2015-12-22 22:37:06	yama	yeah
2015-12-22 22:38:35	yama	i guess some personal prejudice from my part
2015-12-22 22:39:48	JacolynDandreano	Meh maybe
2015-12-22 22:40:09	JacolynDandreano	or maybe not
2015-12-22 22:40:18	yama	why
2015-12-22 22:40:37	JacolynDandreano	but you wouldn't even if she had all of the attributes I listed
2015-12-22 22:41:41	yama	i dbout it
2015-12-22 22:41:52	JacolynDandreano	because I don't think it is prejudice to not be attracted to a gender and to feel weird about being with someone after you know they were a guy and so you can't help but picturing them as a guy which is a turnoff
2015-12-22 22:42:11	yama	i guess
2015-12-22 22:42:53	yama	ugh
2015-12-22 22:43:21	JacolynDandreano	What? Are you considering having sex with guys now
2015-12-22 22:43:33	JacolynDandreano	dating a guy would be easier
2015-12-22 22:43:40	yama	no ._.
2015-12-22 22:43:43	JacolynDandreano	theyre much nicer
2015-12-22 22:43:52	yama	...because you're a girl
2015-12-22 22:43:57	JacolynDandreano	:)
2015-12-22 22:44:30	JacolynDandreano	Tell the truth... Have you dreamed of the butler
2015-12-22 22:44:38	yama	no
2015-12-22 22:44:42	JacolynDandreano	i have a feeling you did
2015-12-22 22:44:46	JacolynDandreano	but you won't tell me
2015-12-22 22:44:49	yama	but i've dreamed of other things ;)
2015-12-22 22:45:00	JacolynDandreano	:O and you didn't share?
2015-12-22 22:45:08	yama	you don't share either!
2015-12-22 22:45:14	JacolynDandreano	was it a dream of solfire?
2015-12-22 22:45:22	yama	no
2015-12-22 22:45:23	yama	lol
2015-12-22 22:45:25	yama	why would it be
2015-12-22 22:45:31	JacolynDandreano	which of the guys did you dream about
2015-12-22 22:45:31	yama	i barely talk to him
2015-12-22 22:45:39	JacolynDandreano	sankaku?
2015-12-22 22:45:46	yama	no
2015-12-22 22:45:59	JacolynDandreano	The butler?
2015-12-22 22:45:59	yama	you have 2 more guesses
2015-12-22 22:46:15	JacolynDandreano	the gmb guy
2015-12-22 22:46:29	JacolynDandreano	which of these guys did you dream about
2015-12-22 22:46:37	yama	1 more try
2015-12-22 22:47:15	JacolynDandreano	Did you dream about kissing phi
2015-12-22 22:47:40	yama	i think you're projecting your own dreams
2015-12-22 22:47:45	JacolynDandreano	Lol
2015-12-22 22:47:54	JacolynDandreano	no I'm trying to get a rise out of you

2015-12-23 00:55:35	JacolynDandreano	and there is a special ep coming out on new year's eve
2015-12-23 00:55:35	JacolynDandreano	and there is a special ep coming out on new year's eve
2015-12-23 00:55:44	JacolynDandreano	What are you doing
2015-12-23 00:59:47	JacolynDandreano	In bed I guess

2015-12-23 01:15:52	JacolynDandreano	Having fun?

2015-12-23 01:16:30	yama	no one can keep up with me in playing portal 2 :(
2015-12-23 01:20:46	JacolynDandreano	Really
2015-12-23 01:20:52	JacolynDandreano	youre good at it?
2015-12-23 01:21:44	yama	dunno but i really enjoy it
2015-12-23 01:21:50	yama	so i could keep going
2015-12-23 01:21:57	yama	but my friend wants to play something else
2015-12-23 01:23:30	JacolynDandreano	Oh well I'm going to bed
2015-12-23 01:23:38	JacolynDandreano	night
2015-12-23 01:23:43	yama	aw
2015-12-23 01:23:50	yama	gn :(
2015-12-23 01:56:07	yama	i wish you didn't leave cause i don't remember what happened last
2015-12-23 01:56:17	yama	i guess you walked away from the lake
2015-12-23 02:48:30	yama	the big tree slowly draws closer as you grow more tired, the monotony of the landscape and lack of remarkable events since the lake is filling you with tedium, but at the same time fear has come to reside in the back of your mind and take progresively more hold of it as the night approaches. You find yourself looking behind you more often, and also looking for a corner in which it could be
2015-12-23 02:48:30	yama	safe to sleep, if you'll even manage that. There's no telling if there'll be a moon tonight and just how dark it can get under this roof of leaves and branches. Presently you come upon the closest thing to a road you've seen so far, but the path is marked not only by lack of grass but also by lack of leaves, not a single one, as if someone diligently and constantly swept the floor. But of
2015-12-23 02:48:30	yama	course there's no one in sight as far as your eyes can see. You follow this path while on alert for any corners where to hide for the night and eventually to the side of the road there's a small hole, almost under it, where you figure you could fit curled up into a ball. Which you proceed to do before covering yourself with a blanket. You've avoided doing any serious thinking thus far and now
2015-12-23 02:48:30	yama	your attention wanders between thoughts and desires. Your craving for a cup of hot cocoa is so strong you feel you could materialize the feeling itself. But why not? Why couldn't a cup of hot cocoa just appear in front of you, right now? After all there's no reason, no logic for any of this. Have you been brought by some entity into this magic realm? Is this actually happening? The most
2015-12-23 02:48:30	yama	obvious explanation would be that this is a dream, a very long and persistent dream. But even so it is undeniable that there is something here to explore, whethere it be a lonely wizard pulling you into his lair or your own subconscious, you must find out what is that tree. At first you wanted to use it as a vantage point to find a way out but now something tells you the tree is the reason
2015-12-23 02:48:30	yama	you're here. Visions of the tree start to merge with you breath, your hands start to melt into the ground, your eyes like a waning flame, you sleep with the forest and you dream the forest's dreams, you're a bird in the sky far above the tress, you see mountains with snowy tops and you see columns of smoke behind them, as you fly you become the wind itself, stealing leaves from the trees to
2015-12-23 02:48:30	yama	turn them into things of play, but now you're underwater and you feel you've been underwater for a long long time, alone, looking up at the surface until one day you see a girl...
2015-12-23 02:52:03	yama	The smell of hot chocolate fills your nostrils and slowly drives away the remnants of sleep. You slowly open your eyes. You're in a brightly light small room, in which everything is made of wood, except a giant mug, and a man sitting on a log with his back towards you.
2015-12-23 03:02:19	--	irc: disconnected from server

2015-12-23 11:40:11	JacolynDandreano	thank you
2015-12-23 11:40:13	JacolynDandreano	<3
2015-12-23 11:40:42	yama	just because of those selfies
2015-12-23 11:40:53	yama	but now i slept like 7 hours or less :(
2015-12-23 11:45:49	JacolynDandreano	was it worth it for the selfies that no one else in the world will ever get? :P
2015-12-23 11:46:10	yama	yes
2015-12-23 11:46:14	JacolynDandreano	i didn't think you would write it last night. i thought you might just decide to delete them instead
2015-12-23 11:46:17	JacolynDandreano	:)
2015-12-23 11:46:47	yama	i'm reading Flour Water Salt Yeast
2015-12-23 11:47:27	JacolynDandreano	is that a book?
2015-12-23 11:48:36	yama	yes
2015-12-23 11:48:49	yama	about bread mostly, but pizza too
2015-12-23 11:49:09	yama	he says something at the beginning that i liked, to treat time and temperature as ingredients
2015-12-23 11:49:21	yama	wish i had a thermometer
2015-12-23 11:55:43	JacolynDandreano	meaning that they should be exact?
2015-12-23 11:55:52	JacolynDandreano	the temp of the bread? or the temp of the oven?
2015-12-23 11:56:11	JacolynDandreano	i always measure the temp of the water before i add it for proofing
2015-12-23 11:56:18	JacolynDandreano	but i don't measure the temp of the bread
2015-12-23 11:56:23	yama	the water and the finished dough
2015-12-23 11:56:40	yama	not exact, but measure so they can be considered variables
2015-12-23 11:56:48	JacolynDandreano	finished as in baked? or once the bread has gone through its rises
2015-12-23 11:57:18	JacolynDandreano	i have a full container of bread flour at home. maybe i should make some on saturday if i have time
2015-12-23 11:57:19	yama	he says he's found the ideal dough temperature when finished making the dough is 26c (79f)
2015-12-23 11:57:30	yama	finished as in done kneading
2015-12-23 11:57:57	yama	and he also recommends a slow rise, either by fridge or by using very little yeast
2015-12-23 11:57:59	JacolynDandreano	I'm baking lemon bars tonight and spanakopita for tomorrow night. plus i need to wrap all the presents, so i doubt ill have time to make bread until after christmas
2015-12-23 11:58:08	yama	wtf is that
2015-12-23 11:58:13	yama	spanakopita
2015-12-23 11:58:20	JacolynDandreano	it is greek

2015-12-23 11:59:41	JacolynDandreano	http://allrecipes.com/personal-recipe/62987105/yiayias-spanakopita/
2015-12-23 11:59:42		[ http://is.gd/5Mxt07 ]
2015-12-23 11:59:52	JacolynDandreano	lol not even see my family on christmas?

2015-12-23 12:00:55	yama	families are boring :D
2015-12-23 12:01:10	JacolynDandreano	spanakopita is a little like baklava except that instead of cinnamon/sugar and nut layers between the filo dough, you do a dill/spinach/feta mix
2015-12-23 12:01:15	JacolynDandreano	and egg
2015-12-23 12:01:18	yama	idk baklava either
2015-12-23 12:01:19	JacolynDandreano	rude!
2015-12-23 12:01:24	JacolynDandreano	i like my family
2015-12-23 12:01:25	yama	i dont know fancy foods sry
2015-12-23 12:01:35	JacolynDandreano	they aren't fancy
2015-12-23 12:01:37	JacolynDandreano	just greek
2015-12-23 12:01:55	JacolynDandreano	http://allrecipes.com/recipe/235270/yia-yias-baklava/
2015-12-23 12:01:55		[ http://is.gd/YWMGHO ]
2015-12-23 12:01:58	JacolynDandreano	baklava ^
2015-12-23 12:02:22	JacolynDandreano	is basically a sweet pastry with walnuts and cinnamon/sugar mixture
2015-12-23 12:03:11	yama	sounds nice
2015-12-23 12:03:59	yama	i guess i will keep reading about bread
2015-12-23 12:05:06	JacolynDandreano	ok. then maybe write more
2015-12-23 12:05:28	JacolynDandreano	im not telling you to do this, but you will probably regret making my story so intriguing
2015-12-23 12:05:37	JacolynDandreano	should have made it bad
2015-12-23 12:05:47	JacolynDandreano	because now I'm going to pester you all the time to write more
2015-12-23 12:08:51	yama	i've thought about making a bit as bad as i can to see if you still compliment it
2015-12-23 12:10:12	JacolynDandreano	but the problem with that is that you don't know what i dislike
2015-12-23 12:10:23	JacolynDandreano	so you wouldn't know what to put in it to make it boring
2015-12-23 12:10:52	yama	suddenly you wake up in a room filled with clones of rhine
2015-12-23 12:12:20	JacolynDandreano	-.-
2015-12-23 12:13:11	yama	maybe i should have that happen
2015-12-23 12:13:16	yama	so you'll be begging me to finish it
2015-12-23 12:13:27	JacolynDandreano	meh depends what happens next
2015-12-23 12:13:53	JacolynDandreano	do i defeat her with eloquent arguments
2015-12-23 12:14:04	JacolynDandreano	do i physically force her to apologize
2015-12-23 12:14:16	yama	physically o:
2015-12-23 12:14:28	yama	sounds like you've had thought about this in detail
2015-12-23 12:14:30	yama	tell me more
2015-12-23 12:14:58	JacolynDandreano	no i havent
2015-12-23 12:15:10	JacolynDandreano	but I'm not sure how else to deal with a room full of rhines
2015-12-23 12:15:12	yama	its ok u can tell me
2015-12-23 12:15:19	JacolynDandreano	b/c I'm sure they would test my patience
2015-12-23 12:15:36	yama	what if you escape
2015-12-23 12:15:45	yama	only to find yourself in a room full of armless men
2015-12-23 12:16:21	JacolynDandreano	uh are they only missing their arms? ;)
2015-12-23 12:16:29	JacolynDandreano	true nightmare material
2015-12-23 12:16:45	JacolynDandreano	but even your bad scenarios are still creative
2015-12-23 12:16:51	yama	o:
2015-12-23 12:16:52	JacolynDandreano	and i enjoy the creativity of your writing
2015-12-23 12:17:00	yama	what'd you do in that room then
2015-12-23 12:18:40	JacolynDandreano	sit and have intelligent conversation. maybe help them eat, since they have no arms.
2015-12-23 12:18:42	JacolynDandreano	of course
2015-12-23 12:19:08	yama	i thought you'd find them boring
2015-12-23 12:19:19	JacolynDandreano	nah
2015-12-23 12:19:28	JacolynDandreano	just unattractive
2015-12-23 12:19:31	JacolynDandreano	:P
2015-12-23 12:20:01	yama	oh
2015-12-23 13:11:32	JacolynDandreano	have you read anything else useful in all this time

2015-12-23 13:11:43	yama	in regards to bread?
2015-12-23 13:11:49	JacolynDandreano	yes
2015-12-23 13:11:53	JacolynDandreano	isn't that what you were reading

2015-12-23 13:13:52	yama	cause it's 1pm
2015-12-23 13:17:16	JacolynDandreano	i would say that I'm sorry you had to stay up writing for me

2015-12-23 13:18:56	JacolynDandreano	since the second one was specialized and rare. it is worth more

2015-12-23 13:24:17	yama	because you called it art lol
2015-12-23 13:24:24	JacolynDandreano	:)
2015-12-23 13:24:35	JacolynDandreano	the art of getting into my brain
2015-12-23 13:24:40	JacolynDandreano	i really like it
2015-12-23 13:24:44	yama	hah
2015-12-23 13:24:47	JacolynDandreano	and I'm jealous of your creativity
2015-12-23 13:39:20	yama	i wish i could tell if you're just being nice
2015-12-23 13:40:47	JacolynDandreano	I'm never just nice
2015-12-23 13:40:57	JacolynDandreano	if i didn't like it i wouldn't lie about it
2015-12-23 13:41:09	JacolynDandreano	i would say nothing at all
2015-12-23 13:41:28	JacolynDandreano	or if asked about it i would find a way to compliment parts of it but not the whole thing
2015-12-23 13:41:37	yama	 so after all those paragraphs you'd just stay silent
2015-12-23 13:41:39	JacolynDandreano	but i love everything about it so far, so you don't need to worry
2015-12-23 13:41:43	yama	i don't buy it
2015-12-23 13:41:51	yama	there must be something you don't like
2015-12-23 13:42:15	JacolynDandreano	i wouldn't stay quiet after all those paragraphs. i just wouldn't say i liked it. id say something else
2015-12-23 13:42:21	JacolynDandreano	like thank you for writing it
2015-12-23 13:42:32	JacolynDandreano	or "wow, that took a turn i wasnt expecting"
2015-12-23 13:42:35	JacolynDandreano	or something like that
2015-12-23 13:42:39	yama	i must now pay attention to the words you use
2015-12-23 13:42:39	JacolynDandreano	without saying i like it
2015-12-23 13:42:42	JacolynDandreano	i dont lie
2015-12-23 13:42:56	JacolynDandreano	sure pay attention to the words i use
2015-12-23 13:43:09	JacolynDandreano	I LOVE YOUR FUCKING STORY AND EVERYTHING ABOUT IT

2015-12-23 13:43:31	yama	im blushing
2015-12-23 13:43:34	JacolynDandreano	actually that reminds me. there is one thing i don't like about it
2015-12-23 13:43:42	yama	pls tell

2015-12-23 13:44:58	yama	i was more motivated :)

2015-12-23 13:47:31	JacolynDandreano	if i give you a basic selfie will you write more now
2015-12-23 13:48:09	yama	not now cause i should make bread

2015-12-23 13:57:14	JacolynDandreano	here's a selfie in advance as payment for more story. it is me being disappointed you aren't writing more rn. Probably also a bit sad that i need to take a selfie when i look so ungroomed just to get you to write

2015-12-23 14:25:22	yama	i think you could guess which one..
2015-12-23 14:25:44	yama	i dont remember the one with the raised left arm, what were you doing
2015-12-23 14:26:53	JacolynDandreano	i can't remember. i think that was the day that someone was talking about an article they read that said raising your arms above your head to take a pic makes you look skinnier
2015-12-23 14:26:58	JacolynDandreano	so i took the pic as a joke
2015-12-23 14:27:04	JacolynDandreano	but maybe i never posted that
2015-12-23 14:27:20	JacolynDandreano	since i didn't paint over my face
2015-12-23 14:27:44	yama	i thought someone had an armpit fetish and asked you for a pic maybe
2015-12-23 14:27:55	JacolynDandreano	no
2015-12-23 14:28:09	JacolynDandreano	uh well maybe it was a joke about that
2015-12-23 14:28:14	JacolynDandreano	either way i don't think i ever posted it
2015-12-23 14:28:21	JacolynDandreano	b/c i would never post a pic of my face on irc
2015-12-23 14:28:53	yama	ooo so maybe it was a pm request ;)
2015-12-23 14:29:02	JacolynDandreano	probably not
2015-12-23 14:29:35	JacolynDandreano	anyway i have no idea why i posted a lot of these pics :P
2015-12-23 14:30:17	yama	well if they weren't for irc they were for someone, clearly

2015-12-23 14:31:32	JacolynDandreano	well there were times where i uploaded a pic to post on irc and the editing feature was down on imgur so i didn't post it

2015-12-23 17:07:02	yama	i thought you said "just write the end by today"
2015-12-23 17:07:18	JacolynDandreano	no
2015-12-23 17:07:21	JacolynDandreano	i would never say that
2015-12-23 17:07:34	JacolynDandreano	l2read k
2015-12-23 17:07:47	yama	rood
2015-12-23 17:07:54	JacolynDandreano	:D
2015-12-23 17:08:01	yama	im watching a video of kneading 80% dough
2015-12-23 17:09:09	JacolynDandreano	so your idea of "things to do" is just watching videos...
2015-12-23 17:09:13	JacolynDandreano	>(
2015-12-23 17:09:33	yama	i have to make bread for tomorrow!
2015-12-23 17:09:36	yama	and then workout
2015-12-23 17:17:46	JacolynDandreano	why bread for tomorrow?
2015-12-23 17:17:46	JacolynDandreano	why bread for tomorrow?
2015-12-23 17:17:46	JacolynDandreano	why bread for tomorrow?
2015-12-23 17:18:16	yama	instead of having a big meal we're gonna have sandwiches so i thought it'd be better to make own bread
2015-12-23 17:18:50	JacolynDandreano	yes that's a nice idea
2015-12-23 17:18:59	JacolynDandreano	but so you do that on christmas eve?
2015-12-23 17:19:04	JacolynDandreano	will you celebrate christmas then?
2015-12-23 17:19:13	yama	celebrate is a strong word
2015-12-23 17:21:40	yama	i found a playlist of the guy who wrote the book, so convenient
2015-12-23 17:23:54	JacolynDandreano	is it a bunch of lecturers on how to bake bread
2015-12-23 17:24:03	JacolynDandreano	lectures*
2015-12-23 17:24:45	yama	no, it's like 3min vids of every step, autolysing, hand mixing, folding, shaping loaves, proofing and baking
2015-12-23 17:28:11	JacolynDandreano	oh
2015-12-23 17:28:25	JacolynDandreano	what i would like more experience in is working with different types of flours
2015-12-23 17:29:35	JacolynDandreano	and making preferments
2015-12-23 17:29:42	JacolynDandreano	I've read up on it, but never tried
2015-12-23 17:30:27	JacolynDandreano	i wanted to start a sourdough starter, but i don't make bread enough to want to invest flour into it regularly
2015-12-23 17:30:48	yama	whole wheat flour needs more hydration
2015-12-23 17:31:44	JacolynDandreano	yes b/c it typically makes a denser bread
2015-12-23 17:31:45	JacolynDandreano	I've heard
2015-12-23 17:56:31	yama	ok it's autolysing now
2015-12-23 17:58:26	JacolynDandreano	nice
2015-12-23 17:58:31	JacolynDandreano	take pics of finished bread
2015-12-23 17:58:39	yama	ye tomorrow
2015-12-23 17:58:44	yama	i hope it turns out alright
2015-12-23 17:59:12	yama	idk why i can't just look up a simple recipe and make it in a day, i gotta read half a book and learn details
2015-12-23 18:00:28	JacolynDandreano	no, i agree
2015-12-23 18:00:37	JacolynDandreano	research is always best
2015-12-23 18:01:27	yama	ye but it's like i need the research in order to get enthusiastic about it to even make it
2015-12-23 18:02:50	yama	im going 78% hydration
2015-12-23 18:04:41	JacolynDandreano	i expect pics of the finished loaf and the crumb
2015-12-23 18:39:43	yama	if it's not a failure, yes
2015-12-23 18:39:50	yama	im worried about the baking process
2015-12-23 18:40:53	JacolynDandreano	Why?
2015-12-23 18:40:57	JacolynDandreano	is easy...
2015-12-23 18:40:57	JacolynDandreano	is easy...
2015-12-23 18:40:57	JacolynDandreano	is easy...
2015-12-23 18:41:00	yama	because of the dutch oven part
2015-12-23 18:41:06	JacolynDandreano	Oh
2015-12-23 18:41:19	JacolynDandreano	i don't own one so I don't know how those turn out
2015-12-23 18:41:42	yama	i have something similar but the lid has a plastic knob
2015-12-23 18:41:49	yama	and im seeing pics and it seems that's common
2015-12-23 18:41:55	yama	but what if mine isn't fit for an oven...
2015-12-23 18:41:57	yama	and it melts lol
2015-12-23 18:42:13	JacolynDandreano	Uh
2015-12-23 18:42:21	JacolynDandreano	usually they say if it is oven safe on the bottom
2015-12-23 18:42:26	yama	i could take the knob out
2015-12-23 18:42:34	yama	but that would leave a hole in the lid
2015-12-23 18:43:24	JacolynDandreano	take the knob out and cover it with tin foil?
2015-12-23 18:43:33	yama	hmm
2015-12-23 18:45:42	yama	im gonna see if this guy even uses a dutch oven now
2015-12-23 18:45:44	JacolynDandreano	Should I start drinking now
2015-12-23 18:45:59	JacolynDandreano	like a lush
2015-12-23 18:46:14	JacolynDandreano	i feel weird if I drink more than once a month lol
2015-12-23 18:46:18	yama	o:
2015-12-23 18:46:22	yama	well it's the holidays
2015-12-23 18:46:32	yama	are you at the lesbian party yet
2015-12-23 18:46:41	JacolynDandreano	it isn't a lesbo party!
2015-12-23 18:46:53	yama	it will be after you start drinking ;)
2015-12-23 18:46:55	JacolynDandreano	it doesn't start until 7pm
2015-12-23 18:47:00	JacolynDandreano	lol no
2015-12-23 18:47:04	yama	are any of those girls hot
2015-12-23 18:47:10	JacolynDandreano	uh
2015-12-23 18:47:26	JacolynDandreano	well my sisters are going. I'm biased but I think they're pretty
2015-12-23 18:47:40	JacolynDandreano	i suppose all of the girls are pretty
2015-12-23 18:47:42	yama	the other girls
2015-12-23 18:47:49	yama	would i find them hot is what im asking
2015-12-23 18:47:50	JacolynDandreano	prob none that are your type tho
2015-12-23 18:48:33	yama	he does use a dutch oven
2015-12-23 18:48:48	yama	that part scares me
2015-12-23 18:49:40	JacolynDandreano	Can you just cover the whole lid with foil then
2015-12-23 18:49:58	JacolynDandreano	Like use foil instead of a pan
2015-12-23 18:49:59	JacolynDandreano	I'd be scared too
2015-12-23 18:50:07	yama	im more worried about the process of taking the loaf out of where it's rising and putting it in the dutch oven
2015-12-23 18:50:16	yama	and also the temp of the oven
2015-12-23 18:50:57	JacolynDandreano	Ah well good luck
2015-12-23 18:52:05	yama	also he's using oven mitts and grabbing the dutch oven like it's nothing, i feel like i'd burn
2015-12-23 18:52:16	yama	maybe my oven mitt is shite
2015-12-23 18:52:38	JacolynDandreano	Yeah if you can't grab a pan with your mitt then you need a new one
2015-12-23 18:52:41	JacolynDandreano	or a big towel
2015-12-23 18:52:54	JacolynDandreano	I'll have Phyllis knit you one
2015-12-23 18:53:11	yama	ty pam
2015-12-23 18:53:22	JacolynDandreano	-.-
2015-12-23 18:54:00	yama	im jelly of this guy's kitchen
2015-12-23 18:54:28	JacolynDandreano	I'm jelly of everyone's kitchen
2015-12-23 18:54:32	JacolynDandreano	mine is very small
2015-12-23 18:54:38	yama	mine too
2015-12-23 18:54:43	JacolynDandreano	barely any counter space
2015-12-23 18:54:48	yama	and my oven so fucking old
2015-12-23 18:55:17	JacolynDandreano	I have no idea how old mine is. But I got an oven thermometer the other day and found out it doesn't properly heat
2015-12-23 18:55:21	JacolynDandreano	so there is that
2015-12-23 18:55:21	JacolynDandreano	so there is that
2015-12-23 18:55:21	JacolynDandreano	so there is that
2015-12-23 18:55:21	JacolynDandreano	so there is that
2015-12-23 18:55:33	yama	how high does it go
2015-12-23 18:57:34	JacolynDandreano	Well it is supposed to get up to 500deg
2015-12-23 18:57:39	JacolynDandreano	not sure if it can
2015-12-23 18:58:11	JacolynDandreano	the problem I noticed is that when it beeps to tell me the oven is preheated, it is like 5-10 degrees colder than the temp I set it on
2015-12-23 18:58:49	JacolynDandreano	i can't tell if it just needs an extra 10-15min to warm up to the right temp or if it will never warm up to the right temp unless I move the knob higher
2015-12-23 19:06:54	JacolynDandreano	Remember my butt pic from yesterday. I just looked at it. My hand looks really small compared to it. So I checked my measurements. I gained 1.5" on my ass
2015-12-23 19:06:59	JacolynDandreano	-.-
2015-12-23 19:07:07	JacolynDandreano	since the last time I measured
2015-12-23 19:07:16	JacolynDandreano	which was like 1-3 months ago
2015-12-23 19:07:19	JacolynDandreano	i can't remember
2015-12-23 19:19:39	yama	"remember my butt pic"
2015-12-23 19:19:42	yama	as if i would forget
2015-12-23 19:21:18	JacolynDandreano	Lol

2015-12-23 19:21:53	yama	i looked at the pic before i went to bed
2015-12-23 19:21:55	yama	is that weird
2015-12-23 19:22:56	JacolynDandreano	Uh depends how long you looked at it :P
2015-12-23 19:23:39	JacolynDandreano	I'm mixing up the crust for my lemon bars
2015-12-23 19:23:46	yama	pic

2015-12-23 19:24:09	JacolynDandreano	and the bowl was too small so pieces of butter and flour went flying
2015-12-23 19:24:32	yama	lemon bars
2015-12-23 19:24:46	yama	do you have butter and flour on your hair now
2015-12-23 19:25:09	JacolynDandreano	Just a few pieces that I brushed off
2015-12-23 19:25:32	JacolynDandreano	had to brush flour off my dress too
2015-12-23 19:25:40	yama	cute
2015-12-23 19:25:51	JacolynDandreano	No
2015-12-23 19:25:55	JacolynDandreano	annoying
2015-12-23 19:31:17	JacolynDandreano	Also this happened
2015-12-23 19:31:17	JacolynDandreano	* Non-Displayable Attachments *
2015-12-23 19:32:22	yama	this as in "what should happen when you handle dough"?
2015-12-23 19:32:42	yama	or are you talking about how lovely your hair looks
2015-12-23 19:33:27	JacolynDandreano	Lol you think my hair looks good
2015-12-23 19:33:39	JacolynDandreano	it isn't dough tho
2015-12-23 19:33:52	JacolynDandreano	well I guess it is dough
2015-12-23 19:33:59	JacolynDandreano	just very buttery dough
2015-12-23 19:34:21	JacolynDandreano	i was trying to smooth it into the pan with a spoon
2015-12-23 19:34:23	yama	it is dough! that's normal!
2015-12-23 19:34:38	JacolynDandreano	but it was sticking to the back of the spoon and lifting
2015-12-23 19:34:50	JacolynDandreano	so I just used my hands and it stuck to them but not as bad
2015-12-23 19:34:59	JacolynDandreano	then I ate it all off my fingers :P
2015-12-23 19:35:07	yama	O:
2015-12-23 19:35:08	JacolynDandreano	i prob won't fit into my dress tomorrow
2015-12-23 19:35:09	yama	i want some
2015-12-23 19:35:24	JacolynDandreano	you can't. I already ate it all
2015-12-23 19:35:24	JacolynDandreano	you can't. I already ate it all
2015-12-23 19:35:24	JacolynDandreano	you can't. I already ate it all
2015-12-23 19:35:24	JacolynDandreano	you can't. I already ate it all
2015-12-23 19:36:18	JacolynDandreano	Btw. This is how my hair looks when I wash it the night before and don't brush it or put any product in the next morning
2015-12-23 19:36:25	JacolynDandreano	i was extra lazy today
2015-12-23 19:36:44	yama	i really really like it
2015-12-23 19:37:05	JacolynDandreano	I'll take your word for it :P
2015-12-23 19:39:49	yama	good
2015-12-23 19:39:55	yama	finally you believe me
2015-12-23 19:40:09	JacolynDandreano	No I don't feel like arguing
2015-12-23 19:40:11	JacolynDandreano	:)
2015-12-23 20:03:34	JacolynDandreano	How is the bread coming along
2015-12-23 20:03:50	yama	i just gave it its final folding and put it in the fridge
2015-12-23 20:04:00	yama	and had a mini argument with my mom about dutch ovens -_-
2015-12-23 20:05:24	JacolynDandreano	Lol
2015-12-23 20:05:33	JacolynDandreano	what was your stance
2015-12-23 20:06:10	yama	every time i want to do something new or out of the ordinary she seems discontent
2015-12-23 20:09:08	JacolynDandreano	She is wary of using a Dutch oven?
2015-12-23 20:09:19	yama	yes
2015-12-23 20:10:58	JacolynDandreano	I would be too
2015-12-23 20:11:04	JacolynDandreano	new stuff makes me nervous
2015-12-23 20:11:39	yama	but it's how you learn
2015-12-23 20:12:21	JacolynDandreano	Yes but you also want things to turn out right sometimes
2015-12-23 20:15:16	yama	how's your shoulder
2015-12-23 20:18:50	JacolynDandreano	It is weird... The pt has made it more sore in places it hasn't been sore in for a long time and less sore in other places. But overall it feels less tight and a bit better I guess
2015-12-23 20:24:59	yama	sore as in bad sore?
2015-12-23 20:25:10	JacolynDandreano	Yes
2015-12-23 20:25:11	yama	cause sore doesn't inherently mean bad
2015-12-23 20:25:16	yama	what does it consist of?
2015-12-23 20:25:17	JacolynDandreano	no I mean
2015-12-23 20:25:24	JacolynDandreano	the pain I feel
2015-12-23 20:25:26	JacolynDandreano	is there
2015-12-23 20:25:58	JacolynDandreano	but more in my arm. Which is where it was months ago. Lately the pain has been more in my neck, but the neck pain is less rn
2015-12-23 20:26:37	JacolynDandreano	but my arm feels a lot less tight and lighter
2015-12-23 20:27:05	JacolynDandreano	anyway im supposed to do the Pt for like 4 weeks at least before deciding whether or not it has helped
2015-12-23 20:27:52	yama	but what's the routine lik
2015-12-23 20:27:53	yama	like
2015-12-23 20:29:18	JacolynDandreano	It is on my training Tuesday post!
2015-12-23 20:30:13	JacolynDandreano	Basically a bunch of stuff that I don't remember the name for
2015-12-23 20:30:20	JacolynDandreano	I can't decide what to wear

2015-12-23 20:52:23	JacolynDandreano	If it looks bulky it is just because I'm fat and because the dress falls weirdly

2015-12-24 01:01:14	JacolynDandreano	I find myself in a room
2015-12-24 01:01:23	JacolynDandreano	a man is sitting on a log
2015-12-24 01:01:29	JacolynDandreano	with his back to me
2015-12-24 01:03:30	yama	fuck why did i have to introduce a character
2015-12-24 01:08:23	JacolynDandreano	You can write him out really quick
2015-12-24 01:08:31	JacolynDandreano	if u don't want characters
2015-12-24 01:08:37	JacolynDandreano	would be easy
2015-12-24 01:08:46	JacolynDandreano	since it is dream-like
2015-12-24 01:08:49	JacolynDandreano	and transient
2015-12-24 01:08:53	JacolynDandreano	this world
2015-12-24 01:28:28	yama	you're startled but you try not to make any noise as it seems he's not noticed you've woken up yet. He seems to be working on something, his head hunching down. The cup of cocoa seems to be at your arm's reach on purpose but you resist the urge even tho you're starving, to gain some time and assess the situation. You're lying on a rustic yet comfy bed. The ceiling is very low, given this man's
2015-12-24 01:28:28	yama	size you can't figure he'd be able to stand upright. There is only one window, next to him, which is closed. All the light sources in the room seem to be cleverly hidden in order to provide a warm light that's not distracting. Despite looking carefuly around the room there's nothing that resembles a weapon to defend yourself if need arises. "You should drink that before it gets cold" he says
2015-12-24 01:28:28	yama	in a coarse voice, and chuckles. You gasp, he must have very good hearing to notice you've woken up. "T-thanks" you mutter. Your hand reaches for the cup, which if it was a few degrees hotter your hands couldn't hold it. You hug the mug with both hands, you can barely wrap them around it and have them touch at the finger tips, you're not sure if you've ever drunk this much chocolate milk. If
2015-12-24 01:28:28	yama	he was trying to hurt you, he could've done it by now so there's no reason to fear being poisoned. For all you know this man could be who brought you into the forest in the first place. You place your lips on the edge of the mug and take a sip, and enjoy the hot liquid running down your throat as the steam warms your face. "That should reinvigorate you" he says, still with his back to you and
2015-12-24 01:28:28	yama	his attention on something else, "you've slept close to five hours since I found you, and who knows how many more before that". He's now holding something in front of his eyes, probably examining the fruit of his labor, but you still can't see what it is. He finally puts it down and calmly turns towards you. He's smiling and his eyes are squinting, looking very pleased with himself. He grabs
2015-12-24 01:28:28	yama	one end of his moustache and speaks once more: "Welcome home"
2015-12-24 01:28:50	yama	sry for any mistakes (on top of the ones this story is already full of)
2015-12-24 01:35:54	JacolynDandreano	:o so intriguing

2015-12-24 01:37:52	JacolynDandreano	but there is the hot cocoa and comfy bed!
2015-12-24 01:39:09	yama	well clearly he had his back to you cause that puts him in a vulnerable position and it'd help you feel more safe

2015-12-24 12:12:49	JacolynDandreano	then last year, about 11-12 years after we broke up he showed up at my job
2015-12-24 12:13:20	JacolynDandreano	i used the wrong password too many times, so i can't try now
2015-12-24 12:13:25	JacolynDandreano	i need to wait an hour
2015-12-24 12:13:40	yama	you can't just say that and not continue that storyt
2015-12-24 12:15:56	JacolynDandreano	uh i didn't know it was him and he sounded really weird, but i had let him into the building and so while he was waiting at the door, i secretly called my coworker and asked him to come back from his lunch break early b/c there was a guy there acting weird.
2015-12-24 12:15:58	JacolynDandreano	lol
2015-12-24 12:16:19	JacolynDandreano	he was talking too vague and strange
2015-12-24 12:16:25	JacolynDandreano	and i felt uncomfortable
2015-12-24 12:16:27	JacolynDandreano	anyway
2015-12-24 12:16:31	yama	he went there on purpose?
2015-12-24 12:16:34	yama	to look for you?
2015-12-24 12:16:35	JacolynDandreano	i walked out and realized it was him
2015-12-24 12:16:36	JacolynDandreano	yes
2015-12-24 12:16:36	JacolynDandreano	yes
2015-12-24 12:16:53	JacolynDandreano	he came to apologize to me in a round-about way for causing me pain
2015-12-24 12:17:07	JacolynDandreano	and my coworker came back and i introduced him to the coworker
2015-12-24 12:17:22	JacolynDandreano	and then we talked for five minutes and he left
2015-12-24 12:17:30	JacolynDandreano	and that's the end. not much of a story
2015-12-24 12:18:10	JacolynDandreano	i wonder if someone else is using potentia
2015-12-24 12:18:21	JacolynDandreano	b/c i sent password reset email and i didn't receive it
2015-12-24 12:18:27	JacolynDandreano	and i don't think i had another one
2015-12-24 12:18:27	JacolynDandreano	and i don't think i had another one
2015-12-24 12:18:27	JacolynDandreano	and i don't think i had another one
2015-12-24 12:18:27	JacolynDandreano	and i don't think i had another one
2015-12-24 12:19:11	JacolynDandreano	hmm maybe it wasnt this website
2015-12-24 12:19:15	JacolynDandreano	but then which one was it
2015-12-24 12:23:20	JacolynDandreano	maybe it was open diary
2015-12-24 12:23:31	JacolynDandreano	but apparently those diaries can't be accessed anymore
2015-12-24 12:40:51	JacolynDandreano	now i am going through all my old saved emails to see if i saved the password.... there is so much horrible stuff here that i should have never saved

2015-12-24 22:05:56	yama	and the slices of bread were very thick
2015-12-24 22:07:08	yama	i'll probably be more focused on doges, i used to get on the roof (when the house didn't have a 2nd floor) with my dad but that's when there were more fireowrks and less trees
2015-12-24 22:07:15	yama	i hope the neighbors dont light any
2015-12-24 22:08:29	JacolynDandreano	I don't know if we have any sandwich meat that is pork. I'm not sure

2015-12-28 21:22:38	JacolynDandreano	i think

2015-12-28 21:23:52	yama	i wouldn't braid your hair unless you specifically asked me

2015-12-28 21:24:43	yama	well i wasn't using my mouth to braid your hair

2015-12-30 13:19:55	JacolynDandreano	no such thing as being too warm
2015-12-30 13:19:57	JacolynDandreano	:)
2015-12-30 13:19:59	JacolynDandreano	to me
2015-12-30 13:20:15	yama	yeah i don't think you mean that
2015-12-30 13:23:05	JacolynDandreano	I'm mostly serious
2015-12-30 13:23:11	JacolynDandreano	i like extreme temps
2015-12-30 13:23:21	JacolynDandreano	but also I'm always really really cold
2015-12-30 13:23:30	JacolynDandreano	so i doubt it is possible to make me too warm
2015-12-30 13:23:41	yama	why would you want to be sweaty and sticky just from sitting down doing nothing
2015-12-30 13:23:57	yama	i was dripping sweat from doing dislocates in my warmup the other day
2015-12-30 13:24:08	JacolynDandreano	i enjoy swimsuit weather
2015-12-30 13:24:16	JacolynDandreano	makes swimming fun
2015-12-30 13:24:27	JacolynDandreano	wear bathing suit around the house
2015-12-30 13:24:34	JacolynDandreano	etc...
2015-12-30 13:24:37	yama	ye sunburn is so much fun
2015-12-30 13:24:56	JacolynDandreano	the only good thing about being cold is the excuse to be under a million blankets
2015-12-30 13:25:01	JacolynDandreano	also wear clothes that hide fat
2015-12-30 13:25:06	JacolynDandreano	and i don't get sunburned often
2015-12-30 13:25:09	JacolynDandreano	unlike you prob
2015-12-30 13:25:22	yama	because you don't know really high temperatures prob
2015-12-30 13:26:04	JacolynDandreano	i like 90s
2015-12-30 13:26:06	JacolynDandreano	F
2015-12-30 13:26:14	JacolynDandreano	anything past 100F is maybe a bit high
2015-12-30 13:26:30	JacolynDandreano	but i also like it humid. i might be the only person in the world to like it hot and humid
2015-12-30 13:26:45	yama	i feel like you're just trolling 
2015-12-30 13:27:20	JacolynDandreano	im not
2015-12-30 13:27:24	JacolynDandreano	I've always felt that way
2015-12-30 13:27:37	JacolynDandreano	i also like when it is very cold. maybe single digits F
2015-12-30 13:27:48	JacolynDandreano	but only b/c i can use a million blankets
2015-12-30 13:27:50	JacolynDandreano	like i said
2015-12-30 13:28:06	JacolynDandreano	and b/c the cold contrasts with coziness elements well
2015-12-30 13:36:30	yama	well i won't believe you until you're actually in the same weather as me
2015-12-30 13:36:33	yama	where's my selfie

2016-01-02 12:09:53	yama	oh i don't usually like omelette like that
2016-01-02 12:09:56	JacolynDandreano	Pic of the brownie
2016-01-02 12:10:00	JacolynDandreano	why not
2016-01-02 12:10:40	JacolynDandreano	Oh. Well I milk is too many cal
2016-01-02 12:13:36	JacolynDandreano	Nah it is a small amount
2016-01-02 12:14:01	yama	did u weigh it
2016-01-02 12:14:16	JacolynDandreano	I weighed the spinach. I don't bother with the butter
2016-01-02 12:14:20	yama	i guarantee it's more calories than some milk
2016-01-02 12:14:23	yama	why lol
2016-01-02 12:14:25	JacolynDandreano	it is just a small tab of it
2016-01-02 12:14:26	yama	it should be the opposite
2016-01-02 12:14:34	yama	it's probably 100kcal or more
2016-01-02 12:14:44	JacolynDandreano	no
2016-01-02 12:14:47	JacolynDandreano	it can't be
2016-01-02 12:14:52	JacolynDandreano	ill look it up rn
2016-01-02 12:15:15	yama	if you're serious about a cut you cannot not count the fat, it's the most caloric dense macronutrient
2016-01-02 12:17:53	JacolynDandreano	I count everything except the butter
2016-01-02 12:18:05	JacolynDandreano	it was fifty cal. And that was high balling it
2016-01-02 12:18:23	yama	how much was the spinach
2016-01-02 12:22:14	JacolynDandreano	4
2016-01-02 12:22:16	JacolynDandreano	:)
2016-01-02 12:37:52	yama	4 calories?
2016-01-02 12:38:17	JacolynDandreano	Yes
2016-01-02 12:38:22	JacolynDandreano	17g of spinach
2016-01-02 12:38:32	yama	and you count that but not the 50kcal of butter?
2016-01-02 12:39:16	JacolynDandreano	Yes kinda
2016-01-02 12:39:28	yama	...why
2016-01-02 12:39:33	yama	that's like cheating!
2016-01-02 12:39:41	JacolynDandreano	i usually choose "fried egg" which counts for an egg plus 20cal for butter
2016-01-02 12:39:57	JacolynDandreano	i usually have less than 50cal of butter anyway
2016-01-02 12:40:09	JacolynDandreano	but I suppose it would be easy enough to just count the 50cal
2016-01-02 12:40:29	JacolynDandreano	it won't make a diff at the end of the day anyway... 50cal means nothing
2016-01-02 12:40:34	yama	are you still using mfp
2016-01-02 12:40:43	yama	well it means more than 4kcal
2016-01-02 12:40:49	yama	so if you measure the 4
2016-01-02 12:40:49	JacolynDandreano	Uh i am now that I'm serious about a cut
2016-01-02 12:41:32	JacolynDandreano	ill start measuring the butter (by eye tho)
2016-01-02 12:41:37	JacolynDandreano	it doesn't really matter
2016-01-02 12:41:38	yama	noo
2016-01-02 12:43:25	yama	dude, one tbsp of butter is 100kcal
2016-01-02 12:43:30	yama	ONE
2016-01-02 12:44:10	JacolynDandreano	Yes and I usually have half or less
2016-01-02 12:44:20	JacolynDandreano	So no big deal
2016-01-02 12:45:20	yama	that didnt look like half a tbsp to me in the pic
2016-01-02 12:45:25	yama	unless it's a tiny pan
2016-01-02 12:45:26	yama	but ok
2016-01-02 12:45:42	JacolynDandreano	It was tho
2016-01-02 12:45:42	JacolynDandreano	It was tho
2016-01-02 12:45:45	JacolynDandreano	i promise
2016-01-02 12:45:57	JacolynDandreano	the butter sticks have measurements on them you know
2016-01-02 12:46:05	JacolynDandreano	they measure tbsp
2016-01-02 12:46:16	yama	how
2016-01-02 12:47:03	JacolynDandreano	how what
2016-01-02 12:47:40	yama	how do the sticks have measurements

2016-01-02 12:50:06	yama	huh
2016-01-02 12:50:29	JacolynDandreano	Do you not have that
2016-01-02 12:50:33	yama	no
2016-01-02 12:50:38	JacolynDandreano	it makes it easy to measure for recipes
2016-01-02 12:50:38	JacolynDandreano	it makes it easy to measure for recipes
2016-01-02 12:59:19	yama	weighing is easier :)
2016-01-02 13:00:12	JacolynDandreano	Perhaps
2016-01-02 13:00:18	JacolynDandreano	not easier but more precise
2016-01-02 13:01:21	yama	well you can put the pan on the scale, and then the butter and i'll tell you how much it is
2016-01-02 13:01:34	yama	so it's easier in that you don't have to look at the package and calculate by eye
2016-01-02 13:05:02	JacolynDandreano	Meh I don't want to put a hot pan on it
2016-01-02 13:05:11	JacolynDandreano	im just going to measure by eye
2016-01-02 13:05:16	JacolynDandreano	it will be close enough
2016-01-02 13:05:19	yama	just put it before its hot
2016-01-02 13:05:43	JacolynDandreano	and my cut will be more than 500csl deficit anyway so it won't matter if I have eaten slightly more cal
2016-01-02 13:06:19	yama	you shouldn't just go on such a deficit abruptly tho
2016-01-02 13:07:02	JacolynDandreano	Why
2016-01-02 13:08:14	yama	because it's not good, the body needs time to adapt
2016-01-02 13:08:20	yama	hormones and shit
2016-01-02 13:08:33	yama	you should do a week or two in maintenance
2016-01-02 13:08:33	JacolynDandreano	Or else what?
2016-01-02 13:08:52	JacolynDandreano	youre not going to talk me out of this cut. I need it! :/
2016-01-02 13:09:31	yama	uh
2016-01-02 13:09:34	yama	ask phi about it
2016-01-02 13:09:46	yama	maybe youll listen if he's the one to tell you :p
2016-01-02 13:09:50	JacolynDandreano	No
2016-01-02 13:09:52	JacolynDandreano	i wont
2016-01-02 13:10:02	yama	k
2016-01-02 13:10:04	JacolynDandreano	because I don't have two weeks to waste
2016-01-02 13:10:10	JacolynDandreano	i need to lose weight now
2016-01-02 13:10:17	yama	else what
2016-01-02 13:10:29	JacolynDandreano	my goal is a wedding on January 22 that I am in
2016-01-02 13:10:35	yama	meh
2016-01-02 13:10:45	JacolynDandreano	So if I do two weeks at maintenance I won't have lost any weight by then
2016-01-02 13:19:43	JacolynDandreano	Ugh don't be mad at me
2016-01-02 13:19:47	JacolynDandreano	and I'm not asking phi
2016-01-02 13:19:50	yama	:(
2016-01-02 13:20:13	yama	well lyle says it's good to do it but this first comment says it's a theory https://www.reddit.com/r/bodybuilding/comments/32or95/maintenance_before_cutting/

2016-01-03 16:48:54	yama	except fan instead of blanket
2016-01-03 16:49:01	yama	and desk chair instead of couch

2016-01-03 16:50:47	yama	i had a great idea
2016-01-03 16:51:02	yama	i asked people in the film irc to give me their top 10
2016-01-03 16:51:07	yama	so i put them all together
2016-01-03 16:52:25	JacolynDandreano	That's a good idea
2016-01-03 16:52:43	yama	:)
2016-01-03 16:52:49	yama	63 movies so far
2016-01-03 16:52:50	JacolynDandreano	do they discuss movies together

2016-01-03 16:53:40	JacolynDandreano	I'm not sure if I can watch it. I can't find the controller
2016-01-03 16:53:52	yama	that sounds like the lamest excuse
2016-01-03 16:54:07	yama	one guy said it's okay but the first part is better than the last part
2016-01-03 16:54:09	JacolynDandreano	:/ no I mean my SO might have taken it
2016-01-03 16:54:12	yama	another guy likes it
2016-01-03 16:54:25	yama	you can't watch without a controller?
2016-01-03 16:54:59	JacolynDandreano	uh I can maybe watch on the iPad instead. I don't think u can use PS3 without a controller tho
2016-01-03 16:55:15	yama	oh i thought like remote control
2016-01-03 16:55:22	yama	i forgot you had a ps3
2016-01-03 16:55:24	yama	give it to me

2016-01-03 16:55:53	JacolynDandreano	just give me a min
2016-01-03 16:56:15	yama	i think ps3 has voice control, just yell at it
2016-01-03 16:57:05	JacolynDandreano	no! You're just trying to get me to yell at inanimate objects like a fool!
2016-01-03 16:57:25	yama	;)
2016-01-03 16:57:27	yama	just try it
2016-01-03 16:59:18	JacolynDandreano	Lol no
2016-01-03 16:59:40	JacolynDandreano	it doesn't have voice control and if it did, it hasn't been programmed to recognize my voice
2016-01-03 16:59:59	yama	i think some are assembled in mexico so you might need to yell in spanish
2016-01-03 17:01:31	yama	ep 8 is downloaded
2016-01-03 17:01:40	yama	why do you have only 1 controller?

2016-01-03 17:24:13	JacolynDandreano	oh
2016-01-03 17:24:15	yama	he's a pretty famous british actor
2016-01-03 17:24:22	yama	he was dr who for a while
2016-01-03 17:24:23	JacolynDandreano	oh I had no idea
2016-01-03 17:24:35	JacolynDandreano	i didn't watch dr who
2016-01-03 17:24:39	yama	me neither
2016-01-03 17:24:44	yama	but i have some culture
2016-01-03 17:24:49	JacolynDandreano	I saw one random episode
2016-01-03 17:24:56	JacolynDandreano	and I didn't understand the draw
2016-01-03 17:26:28	yama	i never tried, i know there's very different iterations
2016-01-03 17:27:18	JacolynDandreano	i think the love story is a bit of a weak motive for him
2016-01-03 17:27:29	JacolynDandreano	weakness in the plot
2016-01-03 17:27:43	yama	yeah its weird
2016-01-03 17:28:01	yama	but
2016-01-03 17:28:08	yama	this is all mostly from her pov
2016-01-03 17:28:12	JacolynDandreano	I'm scared
2016-01-03 17:28:27	JacolynDandreano	i jumped
2016-01-03 17:28:28	JacolynDandreano	omg
2016-01-03 17:28:34	yama	and the whole show is basically a metaphor for rape PTSD so i guess he doesn't need to be developed
2016-01-03 17:28:46	JacolynDandreano	oh it is?
2016-01-03 17:28:58	JacolynDandreano	i didn't realize the whole thing was about that
2016-01-03 17:29:16	yama	i dunno i thought it was pretty obvious for a while
2016-01-03 17:29:55	JacolynDandreano	so the whole thing is a metaphor for rape PTSD?
2016-01-03 17:30:38	yama	idk if the whole thing but im pretty sure it's one of the main themes
2016-01-03 17:30:50	JacolynDandreano	Oh. Well good to know then
2016-01-03 17:31:05	JacolynDandreano	i wasn't thinking about any deeper implications
2016-01-03 17:31:05	JacolynDandreano	i wasn't thinking about any deeper implications
2016-01-03 17:31:05	JacolynDandreano	i wasn't thinking about any deeper implications
2016-01-03 17:31:05	JacolynDandreano	i wasn't thinking about any deeper implications
2016-01-03 17:31:17	JacolynDandreano	i don't do that with movies or shows that much
2016-01-03 17:31:33	JacolynDandreano	i mostly just enjoy the plot

2016-01-03 17:38:49	yama	so he doesn't hurt anyone else
2016-01-03 17:38:50	JacolynDandreano	She is trying to reason with a psycho?

2016-01-03 17:40:40	JacolynDandreano	honey is the worst thing to call someone
2016-01-03 17:40:47	yama	ok honey
2016-01-03 17:40:57	JacolynDandreano	to me is so condescending
2016-01-03 17:40:57	JacolynDandreano	to me is so condescending
2016-01-03 17:40:57	JacolynDandreano	to me is so condescending
2016-01-03 17:40:57	JacolynDandreano	to me is so condescending
2016-01-03 17:41:25	yama	here it's normal to call someone "gordi" affectionally, kind of means fatty
2016-01-03 17:41:47	JacolynDandreano	Really? Like joking around?
2016-01-03 17:41:57	JacolynDandreano	would u say it to ur mom or a girl u like
2016-01-03 17:42:02	yama	no it's like saying honey
2016-01-03 17:42:07	yama	no, between couples 
2016-01-03 17:42:22	yama	or maybe to a kid
2016-01-03 17:42:30	JacolynDandreano	i don't think I would like that
2016-01-03 17:42:39	JacolynDandreano	also I missed what happened with the neighbor
2016-01-03 17:42:43	yama	it's like saying baby
2016-01-03 17:42:55	yama	has nothing to do with babies for real
2016-01-03 17:43:02	JacolynDandreano	yeah but calling them fat?
2016-01-03 17:43:53	yama	why is it worse than calling someone a baby
2016-01-03 17:44:13	JacolynDandreano	Because I wouldn't want tobe called fat
2016-01-03 17:44:35	JacolynDandreano	they're making us feel sympathy for him
2016-01-03 17:44:44	yama	because baby is a normal nickname for you and your culture
2016-01-03 17:45:14	JacolynDandreano	are u trolling me so that I go there and call people gordi
2016-01-03 17:45:20	yama	i don't feel sympathy yet
2016-01-03 17:45:25	yama	lol no
2016-01-03 17:45:28	JacolynDandreano	I do
2016-01-03 17:45:29	yama	ouch
2016-01-03 17:45:47	yama	i know you won't come here anyway :p
2016-01-03 17:46:26	JacolynDandreano	tho I suppose the point is that the abuse someone has previously suffered does not justify their monstrous actions against others
2016-01-03 17:46:44	JacolynDandreano	yeah I prob never will. If I could I would tho :)
2016-01-03 17:47:14	JacolynDandreano	somewhere in an alternate universe another Jacolyn has visited there
2016-01-03 17:47:30	yama	:D
2016-01-03 17:49:51	yama	and alt-jacolyn has eaten my empanadas
2016-01-03 17:50:28	yama	i like this
2016-01-03 17:50:33	JacolynDandreano	Yes obv
2016-01-03 17:50:38	yama	i wish it happened earlier
2016-01-03 17:51:08	JacolynDandreano	He hero part?
2016-01-03 17:51:22	yama	yeah
2016-01-03 17:51:48	yama	im liking his character
2016-01-03 17:51:57	JacolynDandreano	Meh
2016-01-03 17:52:02	JacolynDandreano	im warming up to it
2016-01-03 17:52:22	yama	i think it has a lot to do with the actor
2016-01-03 17:52:51	yama	i feel it's similar to the moriarty character in sherlock except i HATED the actor
2016-01-03 17:53:34	JacolynDandreano	She reminds me of me as a youngster
2016-01-03 17:53:47	yama	did you break your bro's gb
2016-01-03 17:53:57	JacolynDandreano	No. But I was mean like that
2016-01-03 17:54:03	yama	rude
2016-01-03 17:54:12	JacolynDandreano	yep
2016-01-03 17:56:27	JacolynDandreano	her plan is stupid. You can manipulate someone into being a hero but you can't force them to have empathy and care about other people
2016-01-03 17:56:57	yama	well she didnt say force, she said "teach"
2016-01-03 17:57:07	JacolynDandreano	yes but my point still stands
2016-01-03 17:57:45	yama	kek
2016-01-03 17:57:59	JacolynDandreano	he can be taught actions but he can't be taught human sympathy
2016-01-03 17:58:11	yama	well HE suggested that, which means the "seed" for the duo is there
2016-01-03 17:58:27	JacolynDandreano	is there a duo in the original story?
2016-01-03 17:58:35	yama	he woulnd't need to be taught because she'd be with him to be his fake moral compass
2016-01-03 17:58:38	yama	i have no idea
2016-01-03 17:58:57	JacolynDandreano	yin and yang

2016-01-03 21:57:42	JacolynDandreano	so worse than the butler giving you a lap dance? I knew it
2016-01-03 21:58:36	yama	i think you just want me to write a fanfic with jailady
2016-01-03 21:59:20	JacolynDandreano	Nah. But that reminds me... You promised me more of my story like a week ago
2016-01-03 21:59:34	JacolynDandreano	and you'd better not put her in it
2016-01-03 21:59:50	yama	( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
2016-01-03 22:00:07	JacolynDandreano	You left off with the man saying I had several hours to decide if I wanted to leave the home or not
2016-01-03 22:00:22	yama	calculating the calories of a sandwich is so annoying
2016-01-03 22:00:32	yama	uhh
2016-01-03 22:00:41	yama	oh yeah i was gonna ask you to decide
2016-01-03 22:01:54	JacolynDandreano	:/
2016-01-03 22:02:08	JacolynDandreano	ok I leave
2016-01-03 22:02:22	JacolynDandreano	because it is the opposite of what I would want to do
2016-01-03 22:04:42	JacolynDandreano	Will you write some tonight?
2016-01-03 22:04:42	JacolynDandreano	Will you write some tonight?

2016-01-03 22:04:55	JacolynDandreano	i kinda want to stay
2016-01-03 22:05:52	JacolynDandreano	But I'm worried that staying means that you will say "ok you stay and then wake up and realize it was all a dream" as an easy way out
2016-01-03 22:06:20	yama	why would you think i'd do that with staying but not with leaving
2016-01-03 22:09:57	JacolynDandreano	Ok fine I pick staying then
2016-01-03 22:10:05	JacolynDandreano	because hot chocolate and bed
2016-01-03 22:10:13	JacolynDandreano	and I want to know what he is working on
2016-01-03 22:10:34	JacolynDandreano	tho it is weird for me to stay in a stranger's home with no motivation
2016-01-03 22:11:36	yama	uh ok
2016-01-03 22:12:54	JacolynDandreano	I will stay tho
2016-01-03 22:13:01	JacolynDandreano	because cozy
2016-01-03 22:13:04	JacolynDandreano	and comfort
2016-01-03 22:13:38	JacolynDandreano	after all the world isn't supposed to make sense right, since it has been odd up to this point anyway
2016-01-03 22:14:01	yama	well i guess ill finish it tonight
2016-01-03 22:14:01	JacolynDandreano	maybe I just feel a strange sense of comfort being there
2016-01-03 22:14:06	JacolynDandreano	nooo
2016-01-03 22:14:11	JacolynDandreano	then I pick leave

2016-01-03 22:14:48	JacolynDandreano	:'(
2016-01-03 22:15:04	JacolynDandreano	When will u write it
2016-01-03 22:16:01	yama	idk
2016-01-03 22:16:32	JacolynDandreano	Do it now so I can read after this movie
2016-01-03 22:17:14	yama	so i can say "still a better love story than twilight"?
2016-01-03 22:52:47	JacolynDandreano	Lol
2016-01-03 22:52:53	JacolynDandreano	oh is this a love story?
2016-01-03 22:53:21	JacolynDandreano	people don't like twilight because it is a good plot or good story elements. They like it for the idea
2016-01-03 22:59:42	yama	they likeit because they are dumb
2016-01-03 23:00:58	JacolynDandreano	I liked it when it first came out
2016-01-03 23:01:01	JacolynDandreano	the first book
2016-01-03 23:01:26	yama	i suddenly feel less flattered about you liking my story
2016-01-03 23:01:34	JacolynDandreano	and I have thought long and hard about why I would be attracted to something that I find to be utterly lacking in every good quality of writing
2016-01-03 23:01:49	JacolynDandreano	ha you make me smile
2016-01-03 23:02:22	yama	was the answer sparkly vampires with abs?
2016-01-03 23:06:48	JacolynDandreano	No
2016-01-03 23:06:57	yama	with forearms then
2016-01-03 23:06:58	JacolynDandreano	i find that particularly abhorrent
2016-01-03 23:07:04	JacolynDandreano	no
2016-01-03 23:07:14	yama	with... dicks?
2016-01-03 23:07:24	JacolynDandreano	the answer is that it is the IDEA of the guy
2016-01-03 23:07:35	JacolynDandreano	That's why all these girls fell in love
2016-01-03 23:08:00	yama	so basically like your story
2016-01-03 23:08:07	JacolynDandreano	What
2016-01-03 23:08:33	yama	u made me like the idea of that girl
2016-01-03 23:08:44	JacolynDandreano	oh
2016-01-03 23:08:47	JacolynDandreano	i suppose
2016-01-03 23:08:58	yama	and made me wish she existed
2016-01-03 23:09:02	JacolynDandreano	im flattered because that means I did it well enough
2016-01-03 23:09:16	JacolynDandreano	which is the only thing the author of twilight did right
2016-01-03 23:12:10	JacolynDandreano	Maybe the girl does exist. And germán in an alternate universe meets her tomorrow
2016-01-03 23:12:15	JacolynDandreano	:)
2016-01-03 23:19:04	yama	aw

2016-01-04 15:32:30	yama	nnoo
2016-01-04 15:34:49	JacolynDandreano	you can make it slightly more interactive by giving me options to choose

2016-01-04 17:01:45	JacolynDandreano	I've seen 0 obv
2016-01-04 17:01:51	yama	shame
2016-01-04 17:02:33	yama	sorry ill stp pestering u about movies
2016-01-04 17:08:12	JacolynDandreano	:) I'm fine with it
2016-01-04 17:08:20	JacolynDandreano	but I'm not easily convinced
2016-01-04 17:08:21	JacolynDandreano	:P
2016-01-04 17:11:03	yama	well this is like the jj episode
2016-01-04 17:11:25	yama	u cant force someone into appreciate art, they have to learn by themselves :)
2016-01-04 17:12:03	JacolynDandreano	maybe they appreciate art differently from other people
2016-01-04 17:12:05	JacolynDandreano	which is ok
2016-01-04 17:13:16	yama	uh but u said yourself you don't look past plot
2016-01-04 17:14:15	JacolynDandreano	in movies. but plot is one element of the art isn't it?
2016-01-04 17:14:29	JacolynDandreano	i just happen to appreciate specific elements more than others
2016-01-04 17:14:31	JacolynDandreano	:)
2016-01-04 17:16:07	yama	yes, the most shallow one :p
2016-01-04 17:16:36	JacolynDandreano	:(
2016-01-04 17:16:47	yama	im just saying youd like movies more if you watched them the same way you read books
2016-01-04 17:19:34	yama	did i offend u
2016-01-04 17:19:40	JacolynDandreano	perhaps, but i suppose i might enjoy them specifically b/c i don't need to think about all of those extra things.
2016-01-04 17:19:54	JacolynDandreano	no, i love to be basically called shallow
2016-01-04 17:20:10	JacolynDandreano	it's ok. you've called me shallow before so it isn't surprising
2016-01-04 17:20:28	yama	i didnt call u shallow
2016-01-04 17:20:38	yama	just the way most people watch movies
2016-01-04 17:20:39	JacolynDandreano	you basically did
2016-01-04 17:20:46	yama	that's not a judgement of you as a person
2016-01-04 17:20:52	JacolynDandreano	if you say so
2016-01-04 17:21:03	yama	k sry
2016-01-04 17:21:06	yama	i wont bother u again
2016-01-04 17:21:13	JacolynDandreano	you aren't bothering me
2016-01-04 17:21:16	JacolynDandreano	stop saying that
2016-01-04 17:22:11	yama	but youre taking it personally and being defensive :(
2016-01-04 17:22:16	yama	and i dont like when people do that
2016-01-04 17:23:28	JacolynDandreano	alright sorry
2016-01-04 17:23:41	yama	no im sorry
2016-01-04 17:25:02	yama	im gonna leave and u can message when u want to talk to me again

2016-01-04 17:27:59	JacolynDandreano	are you mad that i took it personally
2016-01-04 17:28:06	JacolynDandreano	since you say you didn't mean it personally
2016-01-04 17:29:18	yama	im not mad, i just like discussing art
2016-01-04 17:30:20	yama	and i thought you'd agree that like in books plot is one of the most surface aspects, but not in the "you're a shallow person" way, just that it is the most evident aspect of a story
2016-01-04 17:32:50	JacolynDandreano	perhaps
2016-01-04 17:32:56	yama	i need to shower
2016-01-04 17:33:04	JacolynDandreano	ok
2016-01-04 18:04:21	yama	i tried adding salt to peanuts
2016-01-04 18:04:32	yama	all salt stayed at the bottom
2016-01-04 18:11:53	yama	and now i got a mouthful of salt
2016-01-04 18:11:54	yama	-_-

2016-01-04 20:49:59	JacolynDandreano	Which?
2016-01-04 20:53:11	JacolynDandreano	Dragons just said that he thought you lived in Germany because I always call you german there :D
2016-01-04 20:53:33	JacolynDandreano	Then sankaku said "tbf he is pompous like them"
2016-01-04 20:53:37	JacolynDandreano	so funny
2016-01-04 21:25:00	yama	suberkool also thought i was from germany
2016-01-04 21:25:11	yama	Making a Murderer, im downloading it
2016-01-04 21:25:18	yama	idk if that interests you tho
2016-01-04 22:07:34	JacolynDandreano	It is a documentary right? What's the main premise? Ive heard good things about it. And it sounds like something I would particularly like
2016-01-04 22:08:14	yama	i think it's about a wrongfuly convincted man
2016-01-04 22:08:27	yama	and it took like 10 years to make
2016-01-04 22:08:44	yama	i purposedly didnt read much about it once i saw that it looks like i'll really like it
2016-01-04 22:08:52	yama	it looks like the kind of thing i'd binge watch
2016-01-04 22:09:01	JacolynDandreano	I will probably watch it. But I don't want u to wait for me because I won't be on for the next two or three days
2016-01-04 22:09:18	yama	why
2016-01-04 22:09:20	JacolynDandreano	Is it even on Netflix?
2016-01-04 22:09:33	yama	it's made by netflix
2016-01-04 22:09:43	yama	did u finally get sick of me :D
2016-01-04 22:10:11	JacolynDandreano	Not at all
2016-01-04 22:10:41	yama	oh it's already downloaded
2016-01-04 22:10:44	JacolynDandreano	I would watch it with you but I don't want you to have to wait. Plus there aren't many times that I am available to watch it
2016-01-04 22:11:03	JacolynDandreano	so I wouldn't be able to binge watch it

2016-01-04 23:50:37	yama	it is for me
2016-01-04 23:50:37	JacolynDandreano	DO IT
2016-01-04 23:50:45	JacolynDandreano	:( fine
2016-01-05 00:22:50	JacolynDandreano	What is hamburgesa carne or whatever from your mfp? Beef?
2016-01-05 00:23:34	yama	yes
2016-01-05 00:23:43	yama	homemade burgers
2016-01-05 00:23:48	yama	couldnt measure properly tho
2016-01-05 00:24:13	yama	i really dont get how people eat like 200g of protein :/
2016-01-05 00:28:27	--	irc: disconnected from server
2016-01-08 12:18:37	JacolynDandreano	I'm watching that now
2016-01-08 12:27:34	JacolynDandreano	i think it is a bit of a stretch
2016-01-08 12:27:38	JacolynDandreano	the conclusions he comes to
2016-01-08 12:36:15	yama	wow hello
2016-01-08 12:36:15	--	[JacolynDandreano] is away: Offline
2016-01-08 12:36:21	yama	didnt even miss me i see
2016-01-08 12:37:33	JacolynDandreano	obv i did. which is why I'm talking to you now?
2016-01-08 12:37:52	yama	pfft
2016-01-08 12:37:58	yama	maybe you're just bored
2016-01-08 12:38:03	JacolynDandreano	i see you didn't finish my story even tho you said you would
2016-01-08 12:38:06	JacolynDandreano	no, I'm not bored
2016-01-08 12:38:29	yama	no i didn't want to reward your absence
2016-01-08 12:39:44	JacolynDandreano	lol
2016-01-08 12:39:46	JacolynDandreano	wow
2016-01-08 12:39:55	JacolynDandreano	ok so what did you not like about that vid
2016-01-08 12:40:25	yama	dunno didn't convince me
2016-01-08 12:40:49	yama	and what people said in comments, that mccarthy didn't want to pin down the judge as something specific on purpose
2016-01-08 12:47:04	JacolynDandreano	yeah. i prefer it being ambiguous.  also, just b/c he compares him to a djinn doesn't mean he actually intended for him to be one.  that's like me reading that "the snow was a soft blanket" and then concluding that it is actually a blanket.  Metaphors/similes are meant to point you to certain qualities, but they always break down at some point
2016-01-08 12:49:16	yama	yeah that's why i don't like it
2016-01-08 12:58:28	JacolynDandreano	ok, so let's discuss the ending of heart of darkness
2016-01-08 12:58:48	JacolynDandreano	im not sure what the point was of including that last scene with the widow
2016-01-08 12:58:53	JacolynDandreano	maybe i should do some research
2016-01-08 13:06:43	yama	maybe to show that he was a great man even before venturing into the jungle?
2016-01-08 13:07:27	JacolynDandreano	perhaps
2016-01-08 13:09:21	yama	did you like it?
2016-01-08 13:09:28	JacolynDandreano	3 stars
2016-01-08 13:09:39	yama	is that a yes
2016-01-08 13:09:41	JacolynDandreano	which means... not so much
2016-01-08 13:09:48	JacolynDandreano	i was iffy on it
2016-01-08 13:10:03	yama	3 stars is above average i guess
2016-01-08 13:10:17	yama	how did you imagine kurtz
2016-01-08 13:18:21	JacolynDandreano	well yes, but i usually rate older classics at least 3 stars
2016-01-08 13:18:59	JacolynDandreano	i imagined him as a sickly, tannish, wrinkled, middle aged man
2016-01-08 13:20:50	yama	i imagined him as JK Simmons
2016-01-08 13:27:24	JacolynDandreano	yeah i basically did too
2016-01-08 13:27:46	JacolynDandreano	but when i thought about it, he couldn't have been too pale as a european in the african sun all that time
2016-01-08 13:27:51	JacolynDandreano	probably had leathery tanned skin
2016-01-08 13:27:58	JacolynDandreano	or perma-sunburn
2016-01-08 13:28:05	yama	maybe he was like me
2016-01-08 13:28:27	yama	i wonder if his baldness has any influence on the judge being bald
2016-01-08 13:30:27	JacolynDandreano	the judge?
2016-01-08 13:30:30	JacolynDandreano	who are we talking about
2016-01-08 13:30:42	JacolynDandreano	aren't we talking about kurtz
2016-01-08 13:30:46	JacolynDandreano	or BM
2016-01-08 13:31:22	yama	im saying whether heart of darkness had any influence on blood meridian
2016-01-08 13:32:19	JacolynDandreano	oh
2016-01-08 13:32:22	JacolynDandreano	is it meant to have?
2016-01-08 13:32:35	yama	i dunno, im just wondering

2016-01-08 14:50:46	JacolynDandreano	have you been over your calories tho?
2016-01-08 14:51:00	JacolynDandreano	why don't you just dump the soda and get diet or seltzer
2016-01-08 14:57:00	yama	yes, yesterday

2016-01-08 15:36:15	JacolynDandreano	I'm going to lay off the PT a bit
2016-01-08 15:36:51	yama	:(
2016-01-08 15:37:28	JacolynDandreano	yep. im sad
2016-01-08 15:37:28	JacolynDandreano	yep. im sad
2016-01-08 15:38:00	yama	are you going to the dr again
2016-01-08 15:38:52	JacolynDandreano	nah not soon
2016-01-08 15:38:56	JacolynDandreano	too expensive
2016-01-08 15:39:30	yama	wait so it's been hurting more lately?
2016-01-08 15:39:45	JacolynDandreano	this week. yes
2016-01-08 15:39:58	yama	and you started to cut this week
2016-01-08 15:40:07	JacolynDandreano	yeah
2016-01-08 15:40:12	JacolynDandreano	b/c it won't matter
2016-01-08 15:40:21	JacolynDandreano	i posted that late
2016-01-08 15:40:28	JacolynDandreano	since i wasnt online until today
2016-01-08 15:41:15	yama	what wont matter?
2016-01-08 15:42:06	JacolynDandreano	i mean the shoulder hurt either way
2016-01-08 15:42:11	JacolynDandreano	something is wrong with the popping i think
2016-01-08 15:42:20	yama	but it hurts more now
2016-01-08 15:42:23	JacolynDandreano	and some of the PT work makes my arm pop loudly
2016-01-08 15:42:25	yama	that's not a good sign
2016-01-08 15:42:29	JacolynDandreano	no it isnt
2016-01-08 15:42:35	JacolynDandreano	well it doesn't hurt more than ever
2016-01-08 15:42:49	yama	i'd be worried :/
2016-01-08 15:43:04	JacolynDandreano	it is just that it was starting to feel better but when i started doing the PT consistently 2-3x daily, it hurt more
2016-01-08 15:44:08	yama	so it was feeling better, PT made it feel worse, and diet even worse
2016-01-08 15:46:50	JacolynDandreano	uh i dunno about the diet
2016-01-08 15:46:56	JacolynDandreano	i don't think diet matters all that much
2016-01-08 15:47:03	JacolynDandreano	I'm getting plenty of protein and stuff
2016-01-08 15:47:29	yama	so you think it's a coincidence that the week you started cutting it started huring more?
2016-01-08 15:48:43	JacolynDandreano	yes. i think it has to do with the popping feeling of the PT work
2016-01-08 15:48:45	JacolynDandreano	i really do
2016-01-08 15:49:13	yama	oh well
2016-01-08 15:49:21	JacolynDandreano	i told rik that i thought about the popping feeling and realized that when i feel it in my arm, it feels like tendons or something sliding roughly together. when i feel it closer to the joint, it actually feels (and sounds) like the bones are grinding together
2016-01-08 15:49:28	JacolynDandreano	it is not fun
2016-01-08 15:49:47	JacolynDandreano	and i feel it with a lot of upward movements
2016-01-08 15:50:44	yama	my shoulder cracks during dislocates sometimes
2016-01-08 15:51:10	JacolynDandreano	yeah it sounds like that
2016-01-08 15:51:21	JacolynDandreano	like when i crack my back
2016-01-08 15:51:25	JacolynDandreano	sometimes really loud tho
2016-01-08 15:51:25	JacolynDandreano	sometimes really loud tho
2016-01-08 15:51:28	yama	i crack my bones all the time, but mostly fingers
2016-01-08 15:51:47	JacolynDandreano	yeah. now imagine if when you cracked it, the bone was rubbing against the other bone
2016-01-08 15:52:26	yama	no homo
2016-01-08 15:52:49	JacolynDandreano	yes i meant to say that
2016-01-08 19:57:01	JacolynDandreano	Or force him to be on a cut with you :)

2016-01-09 11:58:56	JacolynDandreano	Yes
2016-01-09 11:59:22	yama	i think u just wanted to join but u were too shy :)
2016-01-09 11:59:57	JacolynDandreano	Nope. I was looking for the bathroom. Had to pee. Was rather disturbed at the sight
2016-01-09 12:00:24	yama	i told u there's no bathroom on the 2nd floor so that's a lie
2016-01-09 12:00:30	yama	unless u wanted to pee in my room
2016-01-09 12:02:29	JacolynDandreano	No, I forgot and couldn't find the stairs
2016-01-09 12:02:54	yama	sounds like excuses cause the stairs are easy to find :)
2016-01-09 12:05:10	JacolynDandreano	But I am tired and feeling under the weather so I was groggy and didn't see them right away
2016-01-09 12:27:35	yama	sry i was having lunch

2016-01-09 12:30:27	yama	if i eat nothing else until dinner maybe i can hit my calories

2016-01-09 14:59:51	yama	another day i guess
2016-01-09 15:01:38	JacolynDandreano	Yeah I think someone is either spying on my fb or my phone
2016-01-09 15:01:45	JacolynDandreano	and telling alex
2016-01-09 15:01:48	yama	wut
2016-01-09 15:02:00	JacolynDandreano	yes but how would I even know it is happening
2016-01-09 15:02:21	yama	did you type in the wrong chat :p
2016-01-09 15:02:40	JacolynDandreano	No
2016-01-09 15:03:05	yama	im lost
2016-01-09 15:04:13	JacolynDandreano	Yeah me too
2016-01-09 15:04:20	JacolynDandreano	i don't know how to tell
2016-01-09 15:05:00	JacolynDandreano	to tell if someone has hacked my fb or phone
2016-01-09 15:05:23	JacolynDandreano	Because I think one of the nerds from IRC has
2016-01-09 15:05:38	JacolynDandreano	And is telling Alex things that I say in private convos
2016-01-09 15:06:00	JacolynDandreano	Well there was the whole yaad thing
2016-01-09 15:06:00	JacolynDandreano	Well there was the whole yaad thing
2016-01-09 15:06:00	JacolynDandreano	Well there was the whole yaad thing
2016-01-09 15:06:00	JacolynDandreano	Well there was the whole yaad thing
2016-01-09 15:06:00	JacolynDandreano	Well there was the whole yaad thing
2016-01-09 15:06:27	JacolynDandreano	that I called Britt ditzy and Alex randomly started calling me ditzy like 5 min later
2016-01-09 15:07:47	JacolynDandreano	then a half hour ago he randomly messaged me saying a whole bunch of weird things like "hey jac, what do you do? Omg! Jessica jones! I really like it! Especially tennet" or what ever his name is
2016-01-09 15:08:28	JacolynDandreano	which was a weird way to start a conversation and because 5min beforehand I had just had a 15min conversation with sankaku about what I do for a living
2016-01-09 15:08:46	JacolynDandreano	and then I remembered that you had talked about how you liked that actor from jj
2016-01-09 15:08:55	JacolynDandreano	a few days ago
2016-01-09 15:09:17	JacolynDandreano	and he knows that I'm watching jj but I found it weird that he brought that up
2016-01-09 15:09:26	JacolynDandreano	So now I feel paranoid lol
2016-01-09 15:11:07	JacolynDandreano	But if they are REALLY nerdy can they make it seem like it was a login from my area when they are really somewhere else

2016-01-09 15:13:11	JacolynDandreano	and it says that the location is approximately
2016-01-09 15:13:19	yama	hmm
2016-01-09 15:13:25	yama	change your password just in case?
2016-01-09 15:13:43	JacolynDandreano	but if someone has hacked my phone then they can just see what I write anyway and probably have my passwords
2016-01-09 15:14:10	yama	why do you even keep talking to him tho
2016-01-09 15:14:30	JacolynDandreano	He talks to me first germán
2016-01-09 15:14:39	yama	just delete him?
2016-01-09 15:14:43	JacolynDandreano	but more importantly, I want to know why he is saying that stuff
2016-01-09 15:14:45	yama	nvm it's not my business i guess
2016-01-09 15:14:52	JacolynDandreano	no because I get form checks from him
2016-01-09 15:14:58	yama	k
2016-01-09 15:15:00	JacolynDandreano	and ask exercise related questions
2016-01-09 15:15:09	yama	is that more important than your privacy?
2016-01-09 15:15:35	JacolynDandreano	what does being friends with someone have to do with privacy tho
2016-01-09 15:15:59	yama	go to the security settings and see additional security features
2016-01-09 15:16:10	yama	um, people can know a lot about you by reading your fb?
2016-01-09 15:16:43	JacolynDandreano	Germán I didn't post anything he said tho
2016-01-09 15:16:52	JacolynDandreano	those were all private convos
2016-01-09 15:17:21	JacolynDandreano	so unless you and sankaku and dragons are all telling him things then I can't think of something else...
2016-01-09 15:17:36	yama	the more information about a person you know the easier it is to guess a password
2016-01-09 15:17:56	yama	i don't talk to him, i can't stand him
2016-01-09 15:18:27	JacolynDandreano	Nah I don't think my password is easy to guess
2016-01-09 15:18:39	JacolynDandreano	I didn't make it basic words
2016-01-09 15:18:45	JacolynDandreano	but I guess I can change it again
2016-01-09 15:19:18	yama	change it and add security measures
2016-01-09 15:19:39	JacolynDandreano	personally I think my work computer got hacked by someone from the chan and then they got all my passwords and tho I made new ones, they captured the new ones when I did
2016-01-09 15:19:49	JacolynDandreano	add what security measures tho

2016-01-13 10:26:18	yama	ok
2016-01-13 10:26:22	yama	laters
2016-01-13 11:26:26	JacolynDandreano	:( i just got an email from shelfari saying that since amazon owns them both they are merging it with goodreads and I'm required to move all my stuff over to goodreads if i don't want to lose comments and stuff
2016-01-13 11:26:31	JacolynDandreano	this is really sad
2016-01-13 11:27:16	yama	ha
2016-01-13 11:27:23	yama	they won't make it automatic tho??
2016-01-13 11:27:57	yama	what coments
2016-01-13 11:28:36	JacolynDandreano	they wont
2016-01-13 11:29:07	JacolynDandreano	german I've been a member since 2009. and I've been active (almost daily) up until about a year ago
2016-01-13 11:29:19	JacolynDandreano	why is my computer changing your name back to german lol
2016-01-13 11:30:05	JacolynDandreano	this is their email to me http://pastebin.com/q7A31rLu
2016-01-13 11:30:07	JacolynDandreano	it sucks
2016-01-13 11:30:28	JacolynDandreano	now i need to log into my groups and see if they will be moving over to Goodreads. there was some talk of it for a while but now i don't know
2016-01-13 12:32:50	yama	yeah that's the thing about online services
2016-01-13 12:32:58	yama	they can go down one day and you lose all your data
2016-01-13 12:41:13	JacolynDandreano	yup
2016-01-13 12:41:24	JacolynDandreano	so people don't like the goodreads discussions on groups tho
2016-01-13 12:41:46	JacolynDandreano	we are trying a test group there but amazon emailed the mods and said they need to change their name because there is already a group there with their name
2016-01-13 12:42:17	JacolynDandreano	i created a dummy subreddit so they could check out reddit if they prefer to use it.
2016-01-13 12:43:02	JacolynDandreano	but, they are also trying other places too like LibraryThing, but that site charges if you have more than 200 books
2016-01-13 12:43:45	yama	what is wrong with the goodreads group discussions
2016-01-13 12:44:47	JacolynDandreano	it is very different
2016-01-13 12:45:14	JacolynDandreano	everyone's upset lol
2016-01-13 12:45:24	JacolynDandreano	here is what one person said "I've been using goodreads more and more over the last two years so that I can keep my shelves updated - as we kind of saw this coming. It's nowhere near as good as this site in terms of discussions. I do think that this site has more serious readers and conversations are generally more civil although I have not had a personally negative experience with discussion there."
2016-01-13 12:46:07	yama	but he's just talking about the people, not about the discussions format
2016-01-13 12:46:08	JacolynDandreano	so i guess they prefer shelfari for more serious readers and civil conversations
2016-01-13 12:46:16	JacolynDandreano	hold on...
2016-01-13 12:47:04	JacolynDandreano	everyone just keeps saying the discussion platform isn't as good as it is on shelfari
2016-01-13 12:47:04	JacolynDandreano	everyone just keeps saying the discussion platform isn't as good as it is on shelfari
2016-01-13 12:47:04	JacolynDandreano	everyone just keeps saying the discussion platform isn't as good as it is on shelfari
2016-01-13 12:47:04	JacolynDandreano	everyone just keeps saying the discussion platform isn't as good as it is on shelfari
2016-01-13 12:47:39	yama	well i haven't used any of them but im curious specifically why they say that
2016-01-13 12:48:50	JacolynDandreano	i think it has to do with the way they pick their groups and stuff
2016-01-13 12:49:24	yama	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2016-01-13 12:49:38	JacolynDandreano	yeah this whole thing is such a pain in the butt
2016-01-13 12:49:44	JacolynDandreano	and I'm only interacting with one group atm
2016-01-13 12:49:54	JacolynDandreano	not sure if other groups of mine will leave for GR
2016-01-13 12:51:18	yama	well now i can join the same groups as you and pester you even more
2016-01-13 12:52:17	JacolynDandreano	oh god
2016-01-13 12:52:26	JacolynDandreano	but you're not even following the 1001 books list
2016-01-13 12:52:27	JacolynDandreano	:P
2016-01-13 12:52:41	JacolynDandreano	here is what a man said from a diff group: "I've been on Goodreads for a while; it has its advantages and disadvantages. The "look" and interface is very clunky compared to Shelfari -- I wish that they would really merge the best features of both sites rather than just in effect shutting down Shelfari and forcing everyone to Goodreads as it is. Actually, it seems rather dishonest to call this a "merger" at all -- they're
2016-01-13 12:52:41	JacolynDandreano	just shutting one down and telling us to join the other; it's not even automatic. But we all knew they were going to do this eventually. Goodreads has a far greater membership base; one reason I went there is that everyone I know in person (relatives, coworkers, etc.) was there rather than here; and my reviews and comments seem to get far more responses there than here. I think the comparison is like using OS2 after
2016-01-13 12:52:41	JacolynDandreano	everyone moved to MS Windows, or Betamax after everyone moved to VHS -- yes, they were better in many ways, but what you can do depends on the customer base. Frankly, the biggest difference is just that Goodreads actually works consistently and unfortunately it's been quite a long time since I could say that about Shelfari. (I won't say how long it took me just to get into this group tonight.)
2016-01-13 12:52:41	JacolynDandreano	There is a Shelfarians group on Goodreads that tries to help people make the transition and probably we can find each other there, until the Goodreads version of this group gets going. I'll certainly join this group there, the one thing I have missed on Goodreads is a place to keep all my reviews together, which is one reason I have tried to stay on both with the duplication of effort that involves. This will make my life
2016-01-13 12:52:41	JacolynDandreano	a little simpler."
2016-01-13 12:55:05	yama	so just the UI design?
2016-01-13 12:57:19	JacolynDandreano	the design of the discussions i guess
2016-01-13 12:57:27	JacolynDandreano	but yeah he doesn't like the interface
2016-01-13 13:05:48	yama	well if it's just visual it's not that bad
2016-01-13 13:06:22	JacolynDandreano	meh
2016-01-13 13:07:05	JacolynDandreano	they've been an active group since July 2007
2016-01-13 13:07:11	JacolynDandreano	and I've been there since 2009
2016-01-13 13:07:37	JacolynDandreano	so none of us are going to be happy about having to use a different site, especially one that looks worse
2016-01-13 13:08:44	JacolynDandreano	i have a ton of reviews to add over now
2016-01-13 13:09:02	JacolynDandreano	does GR allow you to rate/review books privately?  so that other people can't see
2016-01-13 13:09:40	yama	no idea
2016-01-13 13:10:35	JacolynDandreano	i just spent my first two hours of work obsessing over this lol
2016-01-13 13:10:35	JacolynDandreano	i just spent my first two hours of work obsessing over this lol
2016-01-13 13:10:35	JacolynDandreano	i just spent my first two hours of work obsessing over this lol
2016-01-13 13:10:35	JacolynDandreano	i just spent my first two hours of work obsessing over this lol
2016-01-13 13:10:50	JacolynDandreano	sorry for boring you with the details
2016-01-13 13:18:40	yama	u dont bore me, i was downstairs sorry
2016-01-13 13:19:00	JacolynDandreano	is ok
2016-01-13 13:19:00	JacolynDandreano	is ok
2016-01-13 13:19:00	JacolynDandreano	is ok
2016-01-13 13:19:09	JacolynDandreano	i meant sorry for ranting for two hours straight
2016-01-13 13:19:13	JacolynDandreano	i had no idea i was doing it
2016-01-13 13:19:39	yama	u can rant all u want
2016-01-13 13:19:52	yama	i rather that than you being quiet
2016-01-13 13:23:09	JacolynDandreano	lol
2016-01-13 13:23:18	JacolynDandreano	well I'm really hung up on this
2016-01-13 13:23:29	JacolynDandreano	am i an old lady that can't accept change
2016-01-13 13:23:31	JacolynDandreano	:P
2016-01-13 13:24:03	JacolynDandreano	help me figure out a new way to keep track of my list of 1001 books.  i should maybe use evernote?
2016-01-13 14:14:24	yama	if you want something fool proof that you know you won't lose, you could use a google docs spreadsheet, cause with google drive you can have the file backed up locally and you can open it with any spreadsheet program
2016-01-13 14:14:41	JacolynDandreano	oh
2016-01-13 14:14:41	JacolynDandreano	oh
2016-01-13 14:14:44	yama	evernote is nice but not sure if it's great for lists
2016-01-13 14:14:44	JacolynDandreano	good idea i guess
2016-01-13 14:15:06	yama	there's this user in ##truefilm who has a really detailed and elaborate spreadsheet of his movies
2016-01-13 14:15:16	yama	the downside is it's not social i guess
2016-01-13 14:15:42	yama	you can have both if you enjoy making lists, one in a file that you know you won't lose, and a site for discussion
2016-01-13 14:16:44	JacolynDandreano	well my list was just saved as a comment.  it only had 4 comments on it and was probably from 5 years ago, so no one but me sees it now.  i just update it every time i read a book from the list
2016-01-13 14:17:58	yama	then it depends what you want. if you just want to have it and add like an X when you read a book, just make a .txt file and if you want sync/backup, you can use dropbox or google drive or anything like that
2016-01-13 14:18:54	yama	if you want good data, like ratings, review, being able to order the list by year, by title, by author, etc, and potentially have stats of how many books you read from what era and quickly find how many books of an author you read, etc, then make a spreadsheet
2016-01-13 14:20:19	JacolynDandreano	nah i just need the list
2016-01-13 14:20:33	yama	then a simple txt file
2016-01-13 14:21:46	JacolynDandreano	okey dokey
2016-01-13 14:53:29	yama	im bored
2016-01-13 14:54:38	JacolynDandreano	well write my story
2016-01-13 14:54:41	JacolynDandreano	LIKE YOU SAID
2016-01-13 14:54:49	JacolynDandreano	im in a bad mood and it would help
2016-01-13 14:55:13	yama	oh
2016-01-13 14:55:16	yama	meh fine
2016-01-13 14:55:19	yama	it will be bad tho
2016-01-13 14:55:24	JacolynDandreano	just write it
2016-01-13 15:03:12	JacolynDandreano	so i guess we are trying goodreads out... "o, goodreads isn't so terrible (at least compared to what I was thinking).
2016-01-13 15:03:12	JacolynDandreano	I have set up the group with a few discussion threads. Anyone who has read Dark Child, or tinker tailor - can you post a few replies to the discussion and see what it looks like?
2016-01-13 15:03:12	JacolynDandreano	some nice things - members can essentially add their book reviews to the group easily then we can link the reviews from members to books as they go up on the "shelves". Polls enable easier voting on some things although the weighted vote and random are trickier. We can add photos and videos. We can add all the 1001 books to the group list and then create "challenges" which will enable us to personally track which books we
2016-01-13 15:03:12	JacolynDandreano	have read and which are still left. We can highly moderate the group to keep it civil and retain our sense of community from here to there. I'm keeping it private for now.
2016-01-13 15:03:12	JacolynDandreano	we can keep mostly the same format over there as we do here. They do things by folders (which I don't particularly love) so there can be folders for BOTM, general discussion, seasonal, challenges, etc.
2016-01-13 15:03:12	JacolynDandreano	Cons: no nesting and not as visually appealing. Discussions aren't as in depth and less respectful BUT... we can control who joins the group and thus create our own atmosphere within the group."
2016-01-13 15:05:36	yama	good
2016-01-13 15:06:37	JacolynDandreano	i joined the croup
2016-01-13 15:06:40	JacolynDandreano	group
2016-01-13 15:06:48	JacolynDandreano	on good reads
2016-01-13 15:07:10	JacolynDandreano	it doesn't look horrible. just the inability to nest comments is annoying. but shelfari didn't have that either
2016-01-13 15:07:36	yama	oh lol
2016-01-13 15:08:45	JacolynDandreano	ok I'm done complaining
2016-01-13 15:08:49	JacolynDandreano	i swear

2016-01-13 17:44:31	JacolynDandreano	so let me practice my guessing... "Podes ir alejando las manos de la pared así si te pasas un poco vas manejando el recupero." means something like "you can go further the hands from the wall if you go up a little you go further the recovery?"
2016-01-13 17:44:32	JacolynDandreano	lol
2016-01-13 17:45:05	JacolynDandreano	is he basically saying that with the handstands you can put your hands further from the wall but if you move them up a bit you can have a longer rest time
2016-01-13 17:45:10	JacolynDandreano	or did i screw that all up

2016-01-13 17:46:29	yama	it's hard to translate, because he's speaking with arg expressions
2016-01-13 17:47:56	JacolynDandreano	pasas is overshoot?
2016-01-13 17:48:43	yama	depends on context
2016-01-13 17:48:46	JacolynDandreano	so my individual translation of the words was somewhat ok then
2016-01-13 17:48:50	yama	it can mean pass
2016-01-13 17:49:04	yama	like pass me the salt, "me pasas la sal"
2016-01-13 17:49:13	JacolynDandreano	or que pasa
2016-01-13 17:49:17	JacolynDandreano	what passed

2016-01-13 17:50:14	yama	que pasa would be that has passed, or if it's a question it'd be "what's happening?" or what happens?

2016-01-13 22:34:50	JacolynDandreano	anyway when I looked up what low temp is, a bunch of websites told me that anything below 97.7 is abnormal
2016-01-13 22:34:57	JacolynDandreano	and can be caused by stuff
2016-01-13 22:35:08	JacolynDandreano	and my normal consistent temp is 96.8

2016-01-16 10:26:30	JacolynDandreano	Which movie
2016-01-16 10:27:45	yama	i'll make my way through that list
2016-01-16 10:27:49	yama	so mostly old movies
2016-01-16 10:28:36	yama	The General, The Passion of Joan of Arc, The Fall of the House Usher are next
2016-01-16 10:28:46	yama	all from the 20's
2016-01-16 10:29:07	yama	maybe i should read the Poe story before watching that last one
2016-01-16 10:29:08	JacolynDandreano	Coooool
2016-01-16 10:29:18	JacolynDandreano	yeah do it
2016-01-16 10:29:25	JacolynDandreano	you don't like Poe tho right
2016-01-16 10:29:29	yama	wat
2016-01-16 10:29:32	yama	i do
2016-01-16 10:29:36	yama	i love poe
2016-01-16 10:29:38	JacolynDandreano	Oh
2016-01-16 10:29:43	yama	u dont even know me :(
2016-01-16 10:29:45	JacolynDandreano	Ok I'm relieved
2016-01-16 10:30:13	yama	most of these movies are less than 1 hour long
2016-01-16 10:30:21	JacolynDandreano	a lot of people don't like Poe and I thought I remembered seeing you rate some of his stories low on GR
2016-01-16 10:30:23	yama	so i can watch more 
2016-01-16 10:30:41	yama	3 is not low, it's mostly cause i read them as a teen, in spanish
2016-01-16 10:30:50	JacolynDandreano	3 is low for poe
2016-01-16 10:30:55	yama	so i often rate something as "okay" until I re-read
2016-01-16 10:31:02	JacolynDandreano	oh
2016-01-16 10:31:26	yama	I do remember a guy saying how Poe wrote A LOT, and that the works most known are the good ones but the rest are mediocre
2016-01-16 10:31:40	JacolynDandreano	i really need to get up and shower. I'm running out of time
2016-01-16 10:31:48	yama	ok
2016-01-16 10:31:57	JacolynDandreano	well people didn't think he was that good
2016-01-16 10:32:15	JacolynDandreano	which has always bothered me
2016-01-16 10:32:18	yama	i like him but i can't say how good i think he was
2016-01-16 10:32:48	yama	because i separate my experience from what i think is the quality, and like i said i haven't read anything of his recently, nor in english
2016-01-16 10:32:49	JacolynDandreano	i think he was masterful with certain elements
2016-01-16 10:33:05	JacolynDandreano	well read something in English then already
2016-01-16 10:33:07	yama	i feel that way about Lovecraft
2016-01-16 10:33:24	JacolynDandreano	i know nothing about lovecraft
2016-01-16 10:33:25	yama	i really like the atmosphere he creates but i can see flaws
2016-01-16 10:33:44	yama	i love the concepts he uses
2016-01-16 10:33:46	JacolynDandreano	eh I suppose that's true of poe
2016-01-16 10:33:49	JacolynDandreano	ttyl

2016-01-16 11:35:15	yama	i "schedule" haircuts with 1 day in advanced
2016-01-16 11:35:45	JacolynDandreano	Lol. Well usually I just go a year between haircuts but that is really bad for my hair

2016-01-16 12:24:08	JacolynDandreano	season two will be her going after the doctor who made kilgrave like that. Because the doctor will be infecting other people
2016-01-16 12:24:19	JacolynDandreano	and then we will have a whole mass of kilgraves
2016-01-16 12:31:04	JacolynDandreano	Did u die

2016-01-16 22:32:15	yama	i already told u i don't feel like writing when u talk to me less

2016-01-16 22:35:37	JacolynDandreano	Because I don't think I've majorly decreased my talking time
2016-01-16 22:36:07	yama	probably cause you're on irc and you don't notice :p
2016-01-16 22:36:15	yama	but its ok u can go
2016-01-16 22:36:42	JacolynDandreano	Well I think it is because you've talked less to me

2016-01-21 22:54:00	yama	y
2016-01-21 22:54:16	yama	i feel i must be the last one u tell :p
2016-01-21 22:54:30	JacolynDandreano	but if I seemed preoccupied and quiet thats why
2016-01-21 22:54:50	yama	i think it's you who won't be around obviously
2016-01-21 22:54:52	JacolynDandreano	last one? Only my family knows. We didn't even tell his family yet
2016-01-21 22:54:52	JacolynDandreano	last one? Only my family knows. We didn't even tell his family yet
2016-01-21 22:54:52	JacolynDandreano	last one? Only my family knows. We didn't even tell his family yet
2016-01-21 22:55:18	yama	u didnt tell marc?
2016-01-21 22:55:34	JacolynDandreano	you're the first person from IRC to know. I'll tell maybe Marc, Chris, and phi soon
2016-01-21 22:55:48	JacolynDandreano	since I talk to them
2016-01-21 22:55:48	JacolynDandreano	since I talk to them
2016-01-21 22:56:00	JacolynDandreano	everyone else can wait 3 or 4 months I guess
2016-01-21 22:56:29	yama	i feel special :p
2016-01-21 22:56:32	yama	how do you feel tho?
2016-01-21 22:56:34	JacolynDandreano	:)
2016-01-21 22:56:51	JacolynDandreano	you're my friend and the person I talk to the most from BWF
2016-01-21 22:57:07	JacolynDandreano	but I just feel sad because I feel like you won't want to talk to me
2016-01-21 22:57:14	yama	why
2016-01-21 22:57:36	JacolynDandreano	honestly? I've felt exhausted lately. Now I know why. Also I felt nauseous yesterday which is what made me check
2016-01-21 22:57:53	JacolynDandreano	i dunno. Because pregnant people are gross
2016-01-21 22:58:03	yama	well so much for your cut
2016-01-21 22:58:11	yama	enjoy eating all you want now
2016-01-21 22:58:13	JacolynDandreano	i promise not to talk about being pregnant like a weirdo
2016-01-21 22:58:27	yama	lol it's ok, your whole life is gonna change
2016-01-21 22:58:36	yama	i dont think that's avoidable :p
2016-01-21 22:59:18	JacolynDandreano	see the thing is that I always pictured myself going crazy with food if it happened and now I just want to make sure I gain as little bodyfat as possible
2016-01-21 22:59:41	JacolynDandreano	so that it is easy to lose weight after and get back to my normal curvy self
2016-01-21 22:59:54	yama	but your cravings are gonna be even stronger
2016-01-21 23:00:07	JacolynDandreano	also, I won't be one of those people that talks about it, so it is avoidable
2016-01-21 23:00:16	JacolynDandreano	yeah but I must resist the cravings
2016-01-21 23:00:21	JacolynDandreano	to be skinny
2016-01-21 23:00:24	yama	i don't believe you :)
2016-01-21 23:00:38	JacolynDandreano	I was thinking I'll even keep tracking
2016-01-21 23:01:01	yama	how do you even calculate tdee to account for that?
2016-01-21 23:01:09	JacolynDandreano	but the past few days I've barely been hungry. I would have skipped eating altogether today if I didn't think it was a terrible idea
2016-01-21 23:01:19	JacolynDandreano	uh I'm going to ask the doctor
2016-01-21 23:01:50	yama	yeah
2016-01-21 23:02:00	JacolynDandreano	theres a healthy amount of weight u should be gaining for each trimester I guess. So I'll make sure I'm at the low end of what i gain
2016-01-21 23:02:15	JacolynDandreano	Anyway I just wanted you to know that is why I was quiet
2016-01-21 23:02:33	yama	ty
2016-01-21 23:02:37	JacolynDandreano	and also because I was so freaking busy with this wedding and work and the phi fundraiser
2016-01-21 23:03:44	yama	so i guess by sept you'll top talking to me
2016-01-21 23:03:45	JacolynDandreano	Anyway I'm done talking about it. Are u weirded out
2016-01-21 23:03:58	JacolynDandreano	no I don't want to stop talking to you
2016-01-21 23:04:01	yama	it doesn't matter what i feel :p
2016-01-21 23:04:08	JacolynDandreano	it does matter
2016-01-21 23:04:08	JacolynDandreano	it does matter
2016-01-21 23:04:16	yama	no, it makes no difference
2016-01-21 23:04:21	JacolynDandreano	tell me if ur weirded out and I won't talk to u
2016-01-21 23:04:29	JacolynDandreano	I'd like to know
2016-01-21 23:04:32	JacolynDandreano	ur my friend
2016-01-21 23:04:52	yama	plus i was pretty sure it'd happen so im shocked but also not surprised, if that makes sense
2016-01-21 23:05:03	yama	i dont want you to stop talking to me
2016-01-21 23:06:36	JacolynDandreano	But I don't want to talk to you if I make u feel weird
2016-01-21 23:06:48	yama	you dont
2016-01-21 23:06:50	yama	dont be silly
2016-01-21 23:06:52	JacolynDandreano	Should I tell Marc now
2016-01-21 23:07:03	JacolynDandreano	I'll tell Marc and Chris I guess
2016-01-21 23:07:48	yama	it's ur choice
2016-01-21 23:08:01	yama	i don't trust lgfd but i dont talk to him :p
2016-01-21 23:08:32	JacolynDandreano	I guess I will. Chris wouldn't tell anyone IMO. But maybe I'll wait. It is just odd to talk to people when they don't know.
2016-01-21 23:08:38	JacolynDandreano	I'm not good with secrets
2016-01-21 23:08:40	JacolynDandreano	lol
2016-01-21 23:09:46	yama	i think im good with them
2016-01-21 23:09:55	yama	with secrets i mean
2016-01-21 23:10:24	JacolynDandreano	I don't tell them. But I hate having any ever
2016-01-21 23:10:57	JacolynDandreano	and if I have a big secret and I see someone irl I start smiling, giggling, get red-faced
2016-01-21 23:11:02	JacolynDandreano	even if it is a bad news
2016-01-21 23:11:19	yama	i guess there's a difference between own secret and secret from someone else
2016-01-21 23:12:15	JacolynDandreano	Yeah maybe
2016-01-21 23:12:51	yama	i wasn't so wrong in thinking it'd be the last book we read
2016-01-21 23:13:26	JacolynDandreano	Why?
2016-01-21 23:14:00	yama	because you'll be busy and distracted
2016-01-21 23:16:34	JacolynDandreano	Maybe not
2016-01-21 23:16:45	JacolynDandreano	ill be tired and want to lie around more
2016-01-21 23:17:51	yama	and thyen the baby will start crying :)
2016-01-21 23:20:10	JacolynDandreano	Uh I plan to finish this book in a week or two. We can pick another book after that if you aren't tired of it
2016-01-21 23:20:50	yama	wow 2 weeks
2016-01-21 23:20:59	yama	but yeah i meant like one of the last i guess :p
2016-01-21 23:21:01	yama	we'll see
2016-01-21 23:21:36	JacolynDandreano	I guess we will
2016-01-21 23:21:56	JacolynDandreano	I was happy to see that this book is not all about apes
2016-01-21 23:21:59	JacolynDandreano	:)
2016-01-21 23:22:17	yama	i already told you it wasn't!
2016-01-21 23:22:23	yama	what part are you at
2016-01-21 23:22:27	JacolynDandreano	Well I didn't believe u
2016-01-21 23:22:46	JacolynDandreano	I stopped at page 50 and only just picked it up tonight when I told u
2016-01-21 23:22:57	JacolynDandreano	but then we started talking
2016-01-21 23:22:59	yama	im already downloading the highest quality version of the movie i could find to rewatch it soon
2016-01-21 23:23:01	JacolynDandreano	so only page 51
2016-01-21 23:23:04	JacolynDandreano	:P
2016-01-21 23:23:15	JacolynDandreano	Is the movie more than just apes
2016-01-21 23:24:05	yama	yessssss
2016-01-21 23:24:30	yama	that's like asking if poe is only about birds
2016-01-21 23:24:39	JacolynDandreano	Haha why don't I remember anything except apes being weird
2016-01-21 23:25:22	yama	the apes scene ends with one of the best edits in film history, u should remember that at least
2016-01-21 23:25:44	JacolynDandreano	I don't
2016-01-21 23:25:57	JacolynDandreano	maybe I should watch the movie after the book too
2016-01-21 23:26:00	JacolynDandreano	:P
2016-01-21 23:26:27	yama	i'd tell you to watch it with me but you'd probably find me annoying
2016-01-21 23:26:46	JacolynDandreano	Why? Would you be telling me every detail about how great it is
2016-01-21 23:27:31	yama	not really
2016-01-21 23:27:48	yama	i'd probably be distracted just looking at it
2016-01-21 23:28:01	yama	i'd pay so much to watch it on a big screen
2016-01-21 23:30:00	JacolynDandreano	Oh so I'd find you annoying because you wouldn't listen to my chatter? :)

2016-01-24 18:49:31	yama	im reading a pretty long article about mccarthy and it's made me want to read all his books

2016-01-24 18:51:42	yama	he talks about the main themes through all of mccarthy's work and then he talks about each book individually, so im skipping most of this part until bm
2016-01-24 19:11:49	JacolynDandreano	Cool so he has some themes that are similar in all his books
2016-01-24 19:15:26	yama	yeah

2016-01-25 14:44:41	JacolynDandreano	english speakers have trouble understanding it
2016-01-25 14:44:47	JacolynDandreano	it just takes extra time i think
2016-01-25 14:45:14	yama	have you ever seen the video about the old english pronounciation?
2016-01-25 14:45:16	yama	it's interesting
2016-01-25 14:48:04	JacolynDandreano	uh i don't think so
2016-01-25 14:48:15	JacolynDandreano	but shakespeare isnt even old english
2016-01-25 14:48:23	JacolynDandreano	it is the beginning of early modern english iirc

2016-01-25 14:54:27	yama	"However, (and i am being completely serious about this, i promise i'm not making this up) I have found that any time i try to do more than 3 pull ups in a row i seem to be stimulating some nerves or something and it makes me orgasm"
2016-01-25 14:54:34	yama	too bad you never got to 3 pullups

2016-01-26 22:41:41	yama	and the disease just made the bad qualities show up more

2016-01-27 22:44:36	yama	no
2016-01-27 22:45:00	yama	i only saw her foot
2016-01-27 22:59:34	JacolynDandreano	Haha
2016-01-27 22:59:42	JacolynDandreano	well was it a pretty foot?
2016-01-27 22:59:51	JacolynDandreano	im starting chapter 17 btw
2016-01-27 22:59:53	yama	i didnt stare :p
2016-01-27 23:00:00	yama	but 
2016-01-27 23:00:08	yama	i think a guy talked to her
2016-01-27 23:00:10	yama	it ws weird
2016-01-27 23:00:58	JacolynDandreano	Tell me the whole convo
2016-01-27 23:01:27	JacolynDandreano	I picture you sitting there so stiff. Purposely looking away the whole time :P
2016-01-27 23:01:32	yama	well in the station she usually gets in, i didnt saw her
2016-01-27 23:01:38	yama	didnt see*
2016-01-27 23:01:57	yama	but i wasn't actively looking, thought maybe she was somewhere behind me or just was off time
2016-01-27 23:02:31	yama	but then, one station before mine, a young dude gets in the car sort of smiling and looking back and seemed to be talking to someone
2016-01-27 23:02:50	yama	i tought he was with a friend or his gf but he walked in alone
2016-01-27 23:02:58	yama	and looks out the window
2016-01-27 23:03:06	yama	and then he walks back to the door
2016-01-27 23:03:14	yama	kind of like telling someone to get in
2016-01-27 23:03:28	yama	and then he just walks off into another part of the car
2016-01-27 23:03:45	yama	and then a woman walks in and goes to the opposite side of the car
2016-01-27 23:03:50	yama	i think it was her
2016-01-27 23:03:55	yama	but im not certain
2016-01-27 23:04:08	yama	but i guess that's what happens when someone talks to her :)
2016-01-27 23:06:09	yama	and i think she was standing behind me when i was at the door about to get off the train
2016-01-27 23:06:20	yama	so she probably got a good look at my ugly bald spot
2016-01-27 23:18:43	JacolynDandreano	Lol thank you for the whole story in detail

2016-01-28 16:10:25	yama	The Passion of Joan of Arc (French: La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc) is a 1928 silent French film based on the actual record of the trial of Joan of Arc. The film was directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer and stars Renée Jeanne Falconetti as Joan. It is widely regarded as a landmark of cinema,[1] especially for its production, Dreyer's direction and Falconetti's performance, which is often listed as one
2016-01-28 16:10:25	yama	of the finest in cinema history. The film summarizes the time that Joan of Arc was a captive of England,[2] depicting her trial and execution.

2016-01-28 20:53:00	JacolynDandreano	to see what you say
2016-01-28 20:53:15	JacolynDandreano	i didn't realize they made silent films this long
2016-01-28 21:23:37	yama	well films were just silent back then
2016-01-28 21:24:00	yama	we can watch it another time

2016-01-28 21:24:09	JacolynDandreano	Nah
2016-01-28 21:24:14	JacolynDandreano	dont change ur plans for me

2016-01-28 21:25:03	JacolynDandreano	also how are u going to comment on the film to him if ur reading the screen?
2016-01-28 21:25:28	yama	im not sure it has titlecards
2016-01-28 21:25:34	yama	or if it does, many
2016-01-28 21:25:52	yama	good silent film makers relied as least as possible on title cards
2016-01-28 21:26:12	JacolynDandreano	well it does
2016-01-28 21:26:22	JacolynDandreano	french and english
2016-01-28 21:26:30	JacolynDandreano	well french
2016-01-28 21:26:35	JacolynDandreano	with English subtitles
2016-01-28 21:27:06	yama	some editions might have the titlecards replaced to english directly
2016-01-28 21:29:16	JacolynDandreano	Oh I see
2016-01-28 21:29:27	JacolynDandreano	that would be easier for me to watch

2016-01-28 21:46:57	yama	i had no reason to
2016-01-28 21:47:02	yama	no one to talk to in english
2016-01-28 21:47:09	JacolynDandreano	Interesting
2016-01-28 21:47:53	JacolynDandreano	And now u just understand immediately what u read
2016-01-28 21:48:02	JacolynDandreano	without needing to translate word for word
2016-01-28 21:48:03	yama	of course
2016-01-28 21:48:14	JacolynDandreano	cool

2016-01-28 21:57:36	yama	:D
2016-01-28 21:59:07	JacolynDandreano	:) just because
2016-01-28 21:59:28	yama	thank you
2016-01-28 21:59:43	yama	u made me smile
2016-01-28 21:59:54	JacolynDandreano	Good
2016-01-28 22:17:18	JacolynDandreano	What are you doing
2016-01-28 22:17:47	yama	logging stuff in mfp :(
2016-01-28 22:17:55	yama	my mom brought some pastries that are so good
2016-01-28 22:17:57	yama	and i want another one
2016-01-28 22:18:17	JacolynDandreano	Pic
2016-01-28 22:18:29	JacolynDandreano	go get one. Take a pic. Then eat it
2016-01-28 22:18:43	yama	ok
2016-01-28 22:25:26	yama	sry i was still logging calories
2016-01-28 22:25:33	yama	apparently i can afford the pastry
2016-01-28 22:25:46	yama	and for the first time ever, i am over my protein goal
2016-01-28 22:25:50	yama	which is suspicious
2016-01-28 22:27:51	JacolynDandreano	I don't find it suspicious that you ate a lot of meat
2016-01-28 22:29:10	yama	i just dont trust mfp sometimes
2016-01-28 22:30:47	JacolynDandreano	Yeah I don't either
2016-01-28 22:30:51	JacolynDandreano	depends on the thing
2016-01-28 22:31:29	JacolynDandreano	luckily I eat practically the same thing every day so that I don't need to check mfp with other sites as often
2016-01-28 22:38:02	yama	well me too for dinner, but it just happens that the stuff i eat for dinner im not sure how to find it in mfp
2016-01-28 22:38:52	JacolynDandreano	Oh
2016-01-28 22:38:55	JacolynDandreano	what is it
2016-01-28 22:39:22	yama	this kind of thing http://www.ranchera957.fm/sites/default/files/ft-medallones-pollo01.jpg
2016-01-28 22:39:32	yama	if you know the name in english that'd help me maybe
2016-01-28 22:41:34	JacolynDandreano	What is it made of
2016-01-28 22:42:00	JacolynDandreano	google image search "chicken cutlets" and see if that is similar
2016-01-28 22:42:55	yama	no, those look like something you make with chicken
2016-01-28 22:43:17	yama	this just like processes chicken probably mixed with flour or something and made into burger shape and breaded
2016-01-28 22:43:23	yama	and you buy it at supermarkets
2016-01-28 22:46:55	yama	i took a bit and almost forgot to take a pic
2016-01-28 22:47:05	yama	bite
2016-01-28 22:48:44	yama	what are YOU doing
2016-01-28 22:50:01	JacolynDandreano	Yum! Flaky deliciousness
2016-01-28 22:50:18	yama	there's only one left :(
2016-01-28 22:50:43	JacolynDandreano	You can't just leave one there all lonely. Give it to me
2016-01-28 22:51:23	yama	earn it
2016-01-28 22:51:30	JacolynDandreano	So the chicken thing you had is just a chicken patty maybe
2016-01-28 22:52:17	JacolynDandreano	I AM earning it by going out of my way to help you with your mfp log
2016-01-28 22:52:20	JacolynDandreano	:)
2016-01-28 22:52:29	yama	looks more like it
2016-01-28 22:52:48	yama	i know what they're called here, and there's some entries on mfp, but they're most by unit
2016-01-28 22:52:53	yama	only a few by grams
2016-01-28 22:53:14	yama	and the one i logged by grams has great macros, but it's probably not the same as mine
2016-01-28 22:53:29	JacolynDandreano	It's probably a chicken patty in english. I really can't think of what else it would be
2016-01-28 22:54:05	yama	i'll log it as that
2016-01-28 22:54:13	yama	and destroy my calories for today L*
2016-01-28 22:54:16	yama	:(

2016-01-28 23:33:21	JacolynDandreano	I was confused because you said no and yes
2016-01-28 23:36:45	JacolynDandreano	Omg frank Poole died

2016-01-29 13:06:00	JacolynDandreano	i could maybe try to do some pushups but i don't think thats a good idea

2016-01-29 13:10:54	yama	why those 5s
2016-01-29 13:17:25	JacolynDandreano	b/c i want to always be able to do consistently 1 min.  so i always add the 5 seconds so that if I'm having an off day and feel really tired, i don't just barely make it to 1 min.
2016-01-29 13:17:34	JacolynDandreano	i don't think that makes sense to anyone but me lol

2016-01-29 13:28:36	JacolynDandreano	use for my submission to Allrecipes.
2016-01-29 13:28:44	JacolynDandreano	it is part of this past month's activities
2016-01-29 13:28:45	yama	oh
2016-01-29 13:28:47	yama	second one
2016-01-29 13:28:54	yama	that doesnt look like a sandwich tho
2016-01-29 13:28:57	JacolynDandreano	the close shot?
2016-01-29 13:29:07	JacolynDandreano	nah i gave up on the sandwich thing for reddit a while ago
2016-01-29 13:30:17	JacolynDandreano	we worked with Knorr rice sides this month.  It was kinda ridiculous.  They were so particular with the guidelines. Wanted us to create a recipe (preferably chili) that used 2 vegetables, only used one pan, 3 steps, under 30 minutes, and only 8 ingredients
2016-01-29 13:30:18	yama	yeah
2016-01-29 13:30:41	JacolynDandreano	usually i make my chili with like 15 ingredients and over 10 hours lol
2016-01-29 13:31:04	JacolynDandreano	oh and we needed to use their rice packet in the chili
2016-01-29 13:31:10	JacolynDandreano	and I've never had chili with rice
2016-01-29 13:31:21	JacolynDandreano	and it is weird to try to cook rice and beef and all that in one pot
2016-01-29 13:31:24	JacolynDandreano	but i figured it out
2016-01-29 13:33:39	yama	congrats
2016-01-29 13:33:50	yama	im trying to get rid of rice :/
2016-01-29 13:33:56	yama	ITS RAINing
2016-01-29 13:36:05	JacolynDandreano	oh, ironically, this week's challenge on the reddit sub is chili. i guess ill just use this pic
2016-01-29 13:36:25	JacolynDandreano	what is wrong with the rain
2016-01-29 13:37:43	yama	wrong?

2016-01-29 14:05:45	JacolynDandreano	cuddling dogs?
2016-01-29 14:06:24	yama	there's only one left so i might have to cut it in half
2016-01-29 14:06:38	yama	i hugged my dog earlier but he's outside
2016-01-29 14:07:43	JacolynDandreano	who are you cuddling then... ;)
2016-01-29 14:08:25	yama	i would trade the pastry for a cuddle
2016-01-29 14:08:31	yama	should i make a craiglist ad
2016-01-29 14:13:37	JacolynDandreano	for the trade? yes

2016-01-29 14:43:10	JacolynDandreano	why
2016-01-29 14:43:24	yama	because tasty but also calories

2016-01-29 14:43:52	JacolynDandreano	or give it to me
2016-01-29 14:44:11	yama	ok
2016-01-29 14:44:14	yama	for cuddles ;)
2016-01-29 14:46:35	JacolynDandreano	haha
2016-01-29 14:48:37	JacolynDandreano	i just ate 6 pretzels
2016-01-29 14:48:50	JacolynDandreano	adding such variety to my lunch
2016-01-29 14:49:05	yama	how many calories was that
2016-01-29 14:49:28	JacolynDandreano	80 :P
2016-01-29 14:49:49	yama	6 pretzels 80 calories??
2016-01-29 14:49:52	yama	are they made of air?
2016-01-29 14:51:01	JacolynDandreano	no

2016-01-29 14:51:54		[ http://is.gd/Q3i9qo ]
2016-01-29 14:51:58	JacolynDandreano	120 calories for 9
2016-01-29 14:52:57	yama	oh they're tiny
2016-01-29 14:53:23	JacolynDandreano	yes
2016-01-29 15:01:46	JacolynDandreano	did u and marc watch the movie last night
2016-01-29 15:03:03	yama	yes
2016-01-29 15:03:20	JacolynDandreano	well? what were your thoughts
2016-01-29 15:03:56	yama	i loved it, he said he liked it but didnt see why it was considered good
2016-01-29 15:05:08	JacolynDandreano	why was it considered good?  did it just have creative use of techniques for its time period?
2016-01-29 15:05:53	yama	yeah, and one of the best performances in film history
2016-01-29 15:06:36	JacolynDandreano	what makes something a good performance?  believable actors?
2016-01-29 15:07:03	yama	most of the movie is told through faces, mostly Joan's face
2016-01-29 15:07:25	yama	it's not just believable, it feels like raw emotion
2016-01-29 15:08:03	JacolynDandreano	that makes sense
2016-01-29 15:10:08	yama	it looks beautiful too, the director wanted no make up and the lighting usually enhances face's "flaws" and details, which most movies seem to want to hide, but you can look at faces the same way you'd be looking at a landscape
2016-01-29 15:11:06	JacolynDandreano	so it makes the character more dimensional
2016-01-29 15:11:10	JacolynDandreano	in a sense
2016-01-29 15:12:04	yama	mostly her yeah
2016-01-29 15:13:00	JacolynDandreano	cool
2016-01-29 15:13:02	JacolynDandreano	:)
2016-01-29 15:13:02	JacolynDandreano	:)
2016-01-29 15:13:02	JacolynDandreano	:)
2016-01-29 15:13:57	yama	i like this: "French director Jean Cocteau famously said it played like "an historical document from an era in which the cinema didn't exist”
2016-01-29 15:15:24	JacolynDandreano	that's interesting.  i never thought there was that much to say about a movie lol
2016-01-29 15:15:28	JacolynDandreano	sorry
2016-01-29 15:16:10	yama	there's MUCH more to say :p
2016-01-29 15:16:18	yama	whole books have been written about individual movies
2016-01-29 15:16:44	JacolynDandreano	that's weird
2016-01-29 15:17:04	yama	the book im reading is pretty long
2016-01-29 15:17:21	yama	and it's only one of many this guy has written
2016-01-29 15:17:24	yama	besides his blog

2016-01-29 15:18:04	yama	nah, it's about movies in general
2016-01-29 15:18:33	yama	been reading it for months and im at 21%
2016-01-29 15:18:54	JacolynDandreano	oh geez.  that's a long book
2016-01-29 15:18:54	JacolynDandreano	oh geez.  that's a long book
2016-01-29 15:18:54	JacolynDandreano	oh geez.  that's a long book
2016-01-29 15:20:36	yama	im not reading it fast tho
2016-01-29 15:21:00	JacolynDandreano	did u finish 2001
2016-01-29 15:21:10	yama	yes
2016-01-29 15:21:20	yama	i thought you'd see my goodreads
2016-01-29 16:01:31	JacolynDandreano	i don't watch scifi movies so you can tell me :P
2016-01-29 16:05:01	yama	but maybe you'd like this one so who knows :p
2016-01-29 16:05:01	--	[JacolynDandreano] is away: Offline
2016-01-29 16:05:11	yama	i can tell you it was relatively recent and popular
2016-01-29 16:10:08	JacolynDandreano	the martian?
2016-01-29 16:10:13	yama	no
2016-01-29 16:10:59	JacolynDandreano	interstellar? gravity?
2016-01-29 16:11:12	yama	one of those, i won't say which
2016-01-29 16:11:48	JacolynDandreano	it is interstellar then. b/c i saw gravity and that wasnt about aliens
2016-01-29 16:12:44	yama	-.-
2016-01-29 16:12:51	JacolynDandreano	:)
2016-01-29 16:12:57	yama	why did you watch Gravity
2016-01-29 16:12:59	yama	and what did you think
2016-01-29 16:13:12	JacolynDandreano	i can't remember why i watched it
2016-01-29 16:13:18	JacolynDandreano	i thought it was sad
2016-01-29 16:15:11	yama	i watched it on imax
2016-01-29 16:16:14	JacolynDandreano	were you utterly amazed
2016-01-29 16:17:18	yama	i was utterly amazed at how annoying sandra bullock and george clooney were
2016-01-29 16:18:01	JacolynDandreano	lol in what way
2016-01-29 16:19:32	yama	unnecessarily verbalizing what they were doing and feeling
2016-01-29 16:19:43	yama	the cinematography was great tho
2016-01-29 16:20:17	JacolynDandreano	it looked cool enough i suppose
2016-01-29 16:37:25	yama	the camera movements and the way the cgi was seamlessly integrated were outstanding, but it'd have been a much better film with 80% less dialogue
2016-01-29 16:37:29	yama	and no clooney
2016-01-29 16:37:34	yama	mum made chocolate cake btw

2016-01-31 15:25:11	yama	i don't think i'd enjoy broccoli on pizza

2016-01-31 15:25:27	JacolynDandreano	the broccoli is tasty imo
2016-01-31 15:25:30	yama	last night
2016-01-31 15:25:41	yama	i dont like the taste of broccoli at all
2016-01-31 15:25:52	JacolynDandreano	have you ever done a white pizza
2016-01-31 15:26:08	yama	well im white so i can't make another kind
2016-01-31 15:26:16	yama	why are you chilling at home in JEANS
2016-01-31 15:27:07	JacolynDandreano	I'm not. I just got back from the pizza store and was so hungry that I decided to eat the slice before changing. I'll change into something else in a little while
2016-01-31 15:27:58	yama	i have salami, onion, green onion, and chicken, what should i put in mine
2016-01-31 15:28:26	JacolynDandreano	chicken and green onion
2016-01-31 15:28:45	yama	would chicken and salami match well?
2016-01-31 15:29:08	JacolynDandreano	is guess yes tho I've never had that combo
2016-01-31 15:29:23	JacolynDandreano	im guessing your salami is similar to our pepperoni
2016-01-31 15:30:32	yama	we have salame and salamin, salame is usually in thin, big slices, while salamin comes as a small sausage and you cut the slices
2016-01-31 15:51:30	yama	apparently there's another irc girl who likes forearms

2016-02-02 11:48:21	yama	does it not exist there?
2016-02-02 11:51:46	JacolynDandreano	oooohhh
2016-02-02 11:51:51	JacolynDandreano	maybe it does
2016-02-02 11:52:00	JacolynDandreano	we are celebrating ash wednesday that week
2016-02-02 11:52:05	JacolynDandreano	so maybe that is what holy week is
2016-02-02 11:52:22	yama	could be
2016-02-02 11:52:26	JacolynDandreano	I'm christian but not catholic so i don't know for sure
2016-02-02 11:52:45	JacolynDandreano	does argentina have a lot of catholics
2016-02-02 11:52:47	yama	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2016-02-02 11:52:50	yama	no clue
2016-02-02 11:53:21	yama	i know it has less than venezuela
2016-02-02 11:53:31	JacolynDandreano	i thought they might. since a lot of south american countries have that as their main religion. and also b/c your country has a lot of italian influence iirc
2016-02-02 11:55:47	yama	i dont think i know anyone who's religious
2016-02-02 11:57:30	JacolynDandreano	oh
2016-02-02 11:57:32	JacolynDandreano	that's odd
2016-02-02 11:57:37	JacolynDandreano	maybe you just don't know many people
2016-02-02 11:57:39	JacolynDandreano	;)
2016-02-02 11:57:45	yama	probably
2016-02-02 11:59:10	yama	i'd like to have like, 1 more friend, i wouldn't want to have lots of acquaintances (what a fucked up word)
2016-02-02 11:59:38	JacolynDandreano	why do you not like that word lol
2016-02-02 11:59:54	yama	doesnt make any sence
2016-02-02 12:02:02	JacolynDandreano	what why
2016-02-02 12:03:08	yama	why is there a c and a q
2016-02-02 12:07:14	JacolynDandreano	uh i dont know
2016-02-02 12:07:25	JacolynDandreano	from the root maybe
2016-02-02 12:08:23	JacolynDandreano	maybe the c is needed b/c phonetics would say that the "a" would be pronounced differently
2016-02-02 12:09:07	JacolynDandreano	so the C is there to keep it more of a schwa sound
2016-02-02 12:09:19	JacolynDandreano	instead of the "long a" sound
2016-02-02 12:18:49	yama	 make NO sense
2016-02-02 12:19:03	JacolynDandreano	haha
2016-02-02 12:19:09	JacolynDandreano	i think it has to do with pronounciation
2016-02-02 12:19:12	JacolynDandreano	:)
2016-02-02 12:19:12	JacolynDandreano	:)

2016-02-02 19:12:04	JacolynDandreano	germán I'm not even making this up. I wrote "I do come here often" twice and both times it changed "come" to Coke

2016-02-02 19:18:59	JacolynDandreano	Same as usual. Tho I did just eat some cereal. I want to read but I also feel like taking a nap
2016-02-02 19:19:06	JacolynDandreano	I can probably do both
2016-02-02 19:19:11	JacolynDandreano	nap first and then read
2016-02-02 19:19:11	JacolynDandreano	nap first and then read

2016-02-02 19:20:24	JacolynDandreano	Uh at this point I told you and phi because I talk to you two. And Marc and jokester because they both asked questions that I didn't know how to respond to and because I can trust them enough
2016-02-02 19:21:43	yama	how did they react
2016-02-02 19:23:25	JacolynDandreano	Phi said "omg are you fucking kidding" or something like that lol. And then said congrats. Marc seemed not surprised (I figure you maybe told him anyway) and happy for me. Jokester seemed happy for me and said congrats
2016-02-02 19:23:45	yama	wow
2016-02-02 19:23:46	yama	WOW
2016-02-02 19:23:53	yama	do you have so little trust in me

2016-02-02 19:31:25	JacolynDandreano	Yes well then I went months without using condoms and nothing happened so
2016-02-02 19:32:19	yama	well it happend now
2016-02-02 19:32:23	JacolynDandreano	i can't believe you would never want a cute little germán running around to teach piano and bwf to
2016-02-02 19:32:28	yama	took my parents 10 years
2016-02-02 19:32:37	JacolynDandreano	ten years! Wow!

2016-02-02 19:33:17	JacolynDandreano	Yikes
2016-02-02 19:33:24	JacolynDandreano	thats a long time
2016-02-02 19:33:40	yama	yeah
2016-02-02 19:33:45	JacolynDandreano	then you have teens who have sex once and get pregnant and didn't even want a kid
2016-02-02 19:33:50	JacolynDandreano	weird to think about
2016-02-02 19:33:56	yama	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2016-02-02 19:34:03	JacolynDandreano	Not that I'm thinking about under aged kids
2016-02-02 19:34:08	JacolynDandreano	-.-
2016-02-02 19:34:16	yama	it'd weirder if those things were clear and b&w 
2016-02-02 19:34:23	JacolynDandreano	I mean weird that so many people have a kid when they don't want one

2016-02-02 19:35:46	yama	i dunno
2016-02-02 19:35:59	JacolynDandreano	but I still think that if you found a girl you really loved who wanted a kid you would feel differently
2016-02-02 19:36:24	yama	well but if i dont really want a kid and i do it cause of her, that's how a lot of marriages end up failing
2016-02-02 19:36:48	yama	but let's not jump ahead when there's not even a girl who'll give me the time of day
2016-02-02 19:37:43	JacolynDandreano	There are girls

2016-02-02 22:40:54	JacolynDandreano	You wake to a loud barking one morning and rush outside to see what has disturbed the dogs.  In the early morning hours you can barely see, but you make out this figure wrapped in white gauze standing in the street. You don't know what or who it is, but it seems otherworldly so you slowly approach, holding your dog firmly.  The figure turns its head and looks down at your dog and your dog leaps into a run from beside you
2016-02-02 22:40:54	JacolynDandreano	and quickly runs to the figure where it suddenly sits and wags its tail patiently like it is waiting for something. The figure has been watching it and then turns to look at you. When the figure's head alines with yours, you feel a quick flutter inside you and a feeling of it drawing you closer. You start to walk again, swifter and swifter.  As you near the figure (which oddly enough hs not become clearer the closer
2016-02-02 22:40:54	JacolynDandreano	you've gotten to it), you are so intent on the sudden longing that has entered you that you forget to watch your step.  You trip over a sharp rock on the side of the road and fall on your back in the grass, hitting your head on a log. You wake moments later with your eyes screwed shut and a pounding headache. You are disoriented and not remembering what has happened or where you are. You feel the dew of the grass on your
2016-02-02 22:40:54	JacolynDandreano	bare arms. It feels refreshing in the warm dark air. something soft brushes your neck. You open your eyes with a quiet groan but your head quickly stops hurting when you see the figure staring back at you - a woman in long robes with dark green eyes which remind you of grass and plump pink lips slightly parted which make u think of the dew. Her long dark hair is brushes ur neck lightly again as she brushes the tendrils
2016-02-02 22:40:54	JacolynDandreano	aside and you close your eyes when u feel a soft kiss upon your neck. A moment later she pulls away. You Open your eyes quickly yet she is gone. But next to your neck in the grass a single pink rose has bent its halfopened petals against your neck
2016-02-02 22:41:28	yama	ooo
2016-02-02 22:41:33	yama	i will go read it in bed
2016-02-02 22:41:38	JacolynDandreano	your dog lays at your feet panting and wagging its tail. You pick the rose and bring it home, pressing it carefully against a book to preserve it
2016-02-02 22:42:27	JacolynDandreano	you go back to sleep and once again are haunted by green eyes and pink lips
2016-02-02 22:43:57	JacolynDandreano	you hate to wake each morning for fear of disturbing the time you spend repeatedly with the figure.  Rushing to bed each night to dream.  And some say you are haunted even to this day.

2016-02-05 09:58:25	yama	why so early tho
2016-02-05 09:58:28	yama	are you bored already
2016-02-05 09:59:19	JacolynDandreano	Procrastinating
2016-02-05 10:00:45	yama	not swamped with work anymore? or are you not at work yet
2016-02-05 10:00:58	JacolynDandreano	I'm home still
2016-02-05 10:01:13	JacolynDandreano	i leave around 8:45 and get to work by 9
2016-02-05 10:01:34	JacolynDandreano	it is snowing outside. 3-5". Might be a not so nice commute
2016-02-05 10:02:12	JacolynDandreano	* Non-Displayable Attachments *
2016-02-05 10:03:00	JacolynDandreano	We might get a nor'easter on Tuesday which could dump a ton of snow. That would be nice for a snow day
2016-02-05 10:03:15	yama	how can a 15min commute be not nice
2016-02-05 10:03:21	JacolynDandreano	They say it might stay out at sea tho. Not sure which way it will move
2016-02-05 10:03:43	JacolynDandreano	well you've never driven in snow. A commute can be bad with snow even if it is short
2016-02-05 10:04:02	JacolynDandreano	slippery roads mixed with bad drivers can easily cause a bad accident
2016-02-05 10:04:23	JacolynDandreano	there's accidents all over this area right now
2016-02-05 10:04:33	JacolynDandreano	according to the traffic report
2016-02-05 10:04:59	JacolynDandreano	Haha
2016-02-05 10:05:01	JacolynDandreano	nah
2016-02-05 10:05:08	JacolynDandreano	some ppl are
2016-02-05 10:05:45	JacolynDandreano	my first few drivers lessons with my dad were in a good foot of snow in a parking lot. So the first thing I learned was how to drive in snow
2016-02-05 10:07:34	JacolynDandreano	I got into an accident once in a snowstorm but it was not really my fault. I was approaching an intersection and I tried to brake way in advance to avoid sliding but my brake line broke and had a leak and I couldn't use brakes. I was picking up speed and saw another car coming toward the intersection
2016-02-05 10:07:55	JacolynDandreano	It felt like slow motion
2016-02-05 10:08:15	JacolynDandreano	the horror of realizing your brakes don't work and that you can't miss the car
2016-02-05 10:09:33	JacolynDandreano	no. Luckily we were both good drivers so we were going slow from the start. He was in a jeep and hit the side of my car from behind. Jeeps are strong so he barely had any damage. My car spun all the way around in the road and was totaled
2016-02-05 10:09:59	JacolynDandreano	I don't know if you're familiar with that term but totaled means you have more damage than the worth of your car
2016-02-05 10:10:30	yama	i just took it as 'destroyed'
2016-02-05 10:10:31	yama	lol
2016-02-05 10:10:40	JacolynDandreano	oh. Yeah basically lol
2016-02-05 10:10:44	JacolynDandreano	tho I got it fixed
2016-02-05 10:10:51	JacolynDandreano	a friend of my dads paid for it
2016-02-05 10:11:00	JacolynDandreano	wanted to do something nice for our family
2016-02-05 10:11:17	yama	weird
2016-02-05 10:11:24	JacolynDandreano	but usually it is better to just get a new car if your car is totaled
2016-02-05 10:12:27	JacolynDandreano	That was probably 6 or 7 years ago. But every time I approach a T-intersection in the snow I brake way too early lol. Because I always remember that day so vividly
2016-02-05 10:12:51	JacolynDandreano	and that's your daily story
2016-02-05 10:13:45	yama	only in the snow?
2016-02-05 10:13:54	JacolynDandreano	Yes
2016-02-05 10:14:03	yama	sounds like you didnt learn much :)
2016-02-05 10:14:19	JacolynDandreano	haha. There's one thing to learn from that
2016-02-05 10:15:05	JacolynDandreano	if i wasn't so shocked by the brakes not working I would have had one second or so to turn my car into the neighbor's yard and into the snow bank
2016-02-05 10:15:10	JacolynDandreano	instead of going straight
2016-02-05 10:15:41	JacolynDandreano	but it happened so fast that by the time I figured out the brakes weren't working at all I was basically in the intersection
2016-02-05 10:15:46	JacolynDandreano	now I know tho
2016-02-05 10:16:16	JacolynDandreano	but fault brake line is pretty rare so I probably will never need that knowledge
2016-02-05 10:16:31	yama	just drive carefully and slow in general :)
2016-02-05 10:16:37	JacolynDandreano	Shhh
2016-02-05 10:16:45	JacolynDandreano	thats only necessary in snow
2016-02-05 10:16:52	yama	-_-
2016-02-05 10:16:55	JacolynDandreano	today I will drive slow
2016-02-05 10:16:56	yama	dont be dumb
2016-02-05 10:17:05	JacolynDandreano	tomorrow I will drive fast
2016-02-05 10:17:11	JacolynDandreano	:)

2016-02-05 19:55:50	yama	u just went quiet
2016-02-05 19:55:57	yama	pixxs
2016-02-05 19:55:58	yama	pizza
2016-02-05 19:56:31	JacolynDandreano	Oh sorry. I was bored and not feeling well. I basically just watched a bunch of recipe gifs on reddit
2016-02-05 19:57:42	yama	being bored is the opposite of an excuse
2016-02-05 19:57:47	yama	unless i make u more bored :)
2016-02-05 19:58:34	JacolynDandreano	dude I made a pizza yesterday with pre made dough. It was much wetter than I am used to. So I put some cornmeal down so that it wouldn't stick to my pan. I had the oven temp around 400F. (My oven was taking too long to fully preheat.) and the dough really billowed up like crazy. Does that happen to you? It was one weird giant air pocket
2016-02-05 19:58:50	JacolynDandreano	no you don't make me bored. I thought u didn't want to talk
2016-02-05 20:00:25	yama	why would u think that, i even pm'd u
2016-02-05 20:00:39	yama	it's normal to have bubbles but not giant pockets
2016-02-05 20:00:42	yama	was the dough cold?
2016-02-05 20:00:57	yama	i think this is the 1st time you ever called me dude
2016-02-05 20:03:00	yama	does your oven not go higher?
2016-02-05 20:06:46	JacolynDandreano	Oh so now you're saying YOU PMed me? ;)
2016-02-05 20:06:58	JacolynDandreano	it goes higher I think
2016-02-05 20:07:47	JacolynDandreano	It was cold
2016-02-05 20:07:54	JacolynDandreano	It was one giant pocket
2016-02-05 20:08:10	JacolynDandreano	i was impatient so I didn't let it warm up or rest much
2016-02-05 20:09:23	yama	why wouldn't you set your oven to the max
2016-02-05 20:09:41	yama	supposedly if the dough is cold you will get more bubbles
2016-02-05 20:09:55	yama	it's normal to let it warm up to room temp before cooking it
2016-02-05 20:10:10	yama	i never used premade dough, only like the premade, already cooked pie
2016-02-05 20:13:26	JacolynDandreano	I'm worried about my pans with my oven on max. I've never made a pizza that high.
2016-02-05 20:13:48	JacolynDandreano	Also I told u my oven is weird about preheating times. It takes forever
2016-02-05 20:14:22	JacolynDandreano	so maybe the dough was just really really cold? It was hard to shape and spread. I kind of forced it :P
2016-02-05 20:15:06	yama	you should put it in max and let it preheat for like 40 mins
2016-02-05 20:15:18	yama	yeah you should do that
2016-02-05 20:15:56	yama	you have to handle it as little as possible
2016-02-05 20:16:03	yama	shouldn't*
2016-02-05 20:17:13	JacolynDandreano	40min!
2016-02-05 20:17:15	JacolynDandreano	omg
2016-02-05 20:17:17	JacolynDandreano	really
2016-02-05 20:18:11	yama	yes it should be as high as possible
2016-02-05 20:18:20	yama	cause home ovens won't be as hot as a pizza oven
2016-02-05 20:22:35	JacolynDandreano	Oh geez
2016-02-05 20:22:46	JacolynDandreano	i think I'll need to get a pizza stone or something
2016-02-05 20:25:03	yama	you don't have one???
2016-02-05 20:25:09	yama	get a steel sheet 
2016-02-05 20:25:19	yama	and get me one :( i can't get them here
2016-02-05 20:26:36	JacolynDandreano	Steel sheet? Are those good? How do u keep the dough from sticking? Making sure the pan is really hot before you slide it on?
2016-02-05 20:27:14	yama	yes they're better
2016-02-05 20:27:30	yama	do you want me to ask a guy where he gets it?
2016-02-05 20:27:33	JacolynDandreano	i had a pizza stone once. And I accidentally brushed it with a ton of olive oil and the low smoke point caused it to smoke a ton and smelled really bad and my smoke alarm was going off
2016-02-05 20:27:44	JacolynDandreano	nah I can find one if I ever decide to get one
2016-02-05 20:27:51	JacolynDandreano	anyway I threw that stone out
2016-02-05 20:27:55	yama	they're always meant to be hot of course
2016-02-05 20:28:03	yama	i mean when you use them
2016-02-05 20:28:08	JacolynDandreano	yeah
2016-02-05 20:28:11	JacolynDandreano	i know
2016-02-05 20:28:21	JacolynDandreano	but I'm asking if that stops the dough from sticking
2016-02-05 20:28:23	yama	steel sheets are better cause they get hotter and retain the heat for longer
2016-02-05 20:28:34	yama	you can use semolina
2016-02-05 20:28:40	JacolynDandreano	oh really? I thought a stone was the ultimate thing to use
2016-02-05 20:28:41	yama	if the dough is too wet
2016-02-05 20:28:55	JacolynDandreano	semolina for the bottom of it?
2016-02-05 20:29:07	JacolynDandreano	is that just flour
2016-02-05 20:29:39	yama	yes
2016-02-05 20:29:43	yama	semolina flour on the bottom
2016-02-05 20:29:46	yama	works like magic
2016-02-05 20:30:26	JacolynDandreano	Hmm
2016-02-05 20:30:34	JacolynDandreano	i have never seen that flour
2016-02-05 20:30:49	JacolynDandreano	I'll maybe check it out the next time I'm making pizza
2016-02-05 20:30:56	JacolynDandreano	i wonder how much a steel pan costs
2016-02-05 20:31:12	yama	i'll find out for u
2016-02-05 20:31:13	yama	later
2016-02-05 20:31:16	yama	cause i need to shower

2016-02-07 17:36:21	yama	yeah it's french
2016-02-07 17:36:28	yama	the director was born in argentina
2016-02-07 17:36:36	yama	the best word i can think to describe it is unrelenting
2016-02-07 17:59:00	JacolynDandreano	I see. Would I have been scared? Lol
2016-02-07 17:59:31	yama	maybe in a few particular scenes but it's not a jumpy movie
2016-02-07 17:59:51	yama	it is very exhausting and trippy
2016-02-07 18:00:06	JacolynDandreano	Cool :)
2016-02-07 18:31:10	yama	what are you doing
2016-02-07 18:31:56	JacolynDandreano	I'm over family's house. Super bowl starts in about 1.5 hours

2016-02-07 18:33:12	yama	i was gonna say if you wanted to watch the movie
2016-02-07 18:33:17	JacolynDandreano	oh

2016-02-07 18:33:48	JacolynDandreano	uh not today. Other days I don't need to count calories. I probably average 500 calories a day right now
2016-02-07 18:34:04	yama	wat
2016-02-07 18:34:10	JacolynDandreano	yeah
2016-02-07 18:34:14	yama	????????
2016-02-07 18:34:17	JacolynDandreano	workout now!
2016-02-07 18:34:18	yama	500 kcals a day?
2016-02-07 18:34:22	JacolynDandreano	yes
2016-02-07 18:34:24	JacolynDandreano	average
2016-02-07 18:34:25	yama	wtf???
2016-02-07 18:34:29	JacolynDandreano	today will be more
2016-02-07 18:34:39	yama	are you insane?
2016-02-07 18:34:54	JacolynDandreano	uh well I feel nauseous 23 hours of the day. So I can't eat or drink much right now
2016-02-07 18:35:35	yama	how are you supposed to grow a person when you're literally starving tho?
2016-02-07 18:35:56	yama	you're supposed to eat like on a surplus of your usual maintenance
2016-02-07 18:36:45	JacolynDandreano	well I was concerned but apparently the daily vitamins help with nutrients. And apparently the baby gets what it needs so the person who would suffer from lack of nutrients would be me
2016-02-07 18:37:05	JacolynDandreano	and right now for at least the next month I only need to eat at maintenance
2016-02-07 18:37:06	yama	i dont understand
2016-02-07 18:37:07	yama	ugh
2016-02-07 18:37:16	yama	but 500kcal is literally starving
2016-02-07 18:37:25	JacolynDandreano	The baby takes what it needs from my body
2016-02-07 18:37:34	yama	while you starve yourself?
2016-02-07 18:37:40	JacolynDandreano	Yeah lol
2016-02-07 18:37:42	yama	i don't think things are that simple
2016-02-07 18:37:51	JacolynDandreano	but I try to eat as much as possible when I can eat
2016-02-07 18:38:11	JacolynDandreano	but yeah I mostly just eat a bagel and some crackers
2016-02-07 18:38:17	JacolynDandreano	some days a bit more
2016-02-07 18:38:24	yama	i really dont understand
2016-02-07 18:38:44	JacolynDandreano	oh well it is just the way it is. I don't know all the science
2016-02-07 18:39:05	JacolynDandreano	I just know that lots of people get morning sickness all day and their babies turn out fine
2016-02-07 18:39:28	yama	im 99% sure it's not that simple
2016-02-07 18:39:35	yama	"fine" is a vague term
2016-02-07 18:39:39	yama	but whatever
2016-02-07 18:40:07	JacolynDandreano	Lol
2016-02-07 18:40:14	JacolynDandreano	im doing my best germán
2016-02-07 18:40:32	JacolynDandreano	if u felt sick just from thinking about food you would not be able to eat either
2016-02-07 18:40:59	JacolynDandreano	but tomorrow is my first doc visit so I'm going to discuss the difficulty of eating enough with the doctor
2016-02-07 18:41:19	yama	im pretty sure i wouldnt literally starve myself, there's liquid calories and stuff
2016-02-07 18:41:21	yama	soup
2016-02-07 18:41:24	yama	whatever
2016-02-07 18:41:42	JacolynDandreano	You don't understand. I can't even drink water most of the time. Liquid doesn't matter
2016-02-07 18:42:13	JacolynDandreano	it isn't just nausea. It is food aversions that develop and make you feel sick to look at or smell those foods or eat them
2016-02-07 18:42:28	yama	:/
2016-02-07 18:42:40	JacolynDandreano	but I found out that I feel ok with cereal and bagels and bananas
2016-02-07 18:42:48	JacolynDandreano	so I have been eating more of those
2016-02-07 18:43:07	JacolynDandreano	and drinking seltzer feels better than water so I have seltzer now too
2016-02-07 18:43:15	JacolynDandreano	but yeah it is pretty limited
2016-02-07 18:43:28	JacolynDandreano	too bad I didn't feel this way when I wanted to cut
2016-02-07 18:44:07	yama	-_-
2016-02-07 18:44:22	yama	you worry me sometimes
2016-02-07 18:45:30	JacolynDandreano	I <3 u for caring
2016-02-07 18:45:33	JacolynDandreano	I do
2016-02-07 18:45:49	yama	i wish i didn't -.-
2016-02-07 18:46:01	JacolynDandreano	Lol why
2016-02-07 18:46:19	yama	because there's nothing i can do
2016-02-07 18:47:49	JacolynDandreano	Well there's nothing I can do either. I have been very positive I think, but last week I cried for like 5min because it feels so gross to be sick all the time

2016-02-08 11:40:34	JacolynDandreano	no homo
2016-02-08 11:40:36	yama	why are you sad
2016-02-08 11:40:50	yama	it happens when you just put a smiley and nothing else
2016-02-08 11:42:24	JacolynDandreano	it never happened to me before
2016-02-08 11:42:25	JacolynDandreano	is it new
2016-02-08 11:42:37	JacolynDandreano	test :/
2016-02-08 11:42:39	JacolynDandreano	hmm
2016-02-08 11:44:53	yama	im looking for films screenshots to use as kindle screensavers
2016-02-08 11:45:08	yama	it's proving to be a difficult task
2016-02-08 11:45:57	JacolynDandreano	y
2016-02-08 11:46:37	yama	because film is horizontal, the screen is verticual
2016-02-08 11:46:40	yama	vertical
2016-02-08 11:46:53	yama	so there's a lot of beautiful shots that just don't look good cropped
2016-02-08 11:47:49	JacolynDandreano	oh. i would have never thought about that
2016-02-08 11:47:59	JacolynDandreano	you know way too much about film ;)
2016-02-08 11:48:25	yama	well you would have if you tried cropping a screenshot to make it fit
2016-02-08 11:48:33	yama	specially widescreen movies -_-
2016-02-08 11:49:11	JacolynDandreano	lol
2016-02-08 11:49:40	yama	i have 4 so far

2016-02-08 11:52:22	yama	as many as i can get 
2016-02-08 11:52:34	yama	do you know if you can make an imgur album and then add images to it?
2016-02-08 11:52:39	yama	like after you made the album

2016-02-08 12:00:23	yama	http://imgur.com/a/oNuH4
2016-02-08 12:01:45	JacolynDandreano	i like them all
2016-02-08 12:14:50	yama	im conflicted, idk if i should make more or just use the current book cover as screensaver
2016-02-08 12:16:03	JacolynDandreano	but i don't understand.... if you can only use one at a time, why would you need more than one right now
2016-02-08 12:16:11	yama	they cycle
2016-02-08 12:16:25	yama	every time you turn the screen off one different comes up
2016-02-08 12:17:21	JacolynDandreano	oh i see

2016-02-08 12:40:04	JacolynDandreano	well it is less of a doctors appointment and more of a "confirmation" that I'm pregnant

2016-02-08 12:40:15	yama	and you're going to stay at work

2016-02-08 12:59:32	JacolynDandreano	plus maybe you'd see me at the store sometimes
2016-02-08 12:59:37	JacolynDandreano	and then we would hug and say hi
2016-02-08 12:59:44	yama	it's like having a cake in front of you and not being able to eat it
2016-02-08 12:59:57	JacolynDandreano	lol
2016-02-08 13:00:04	JacolynDandreano	wow I'm cake now?

2016-02-08 13:00:23	JacolynDandreano	i hope I'm a good cake and not like a mud pie
2016-02-08 13:00:35	yama	idk what a mudpie is
2016-02-08 13:01:12	JacolynDandreano	"mud made into a pie shape by a child."
2016-02-08 13:01:15	JacolynDandreano	:)
2016-02-08 13:01:25	yama	lol
2016-02-08 13:01:34	yama	that counts as cake?

2016-02-08 13:05:39	yama	what if u dont recognize me in person
2016-02-08 13:06:07	JacolynDandreano	what are you going to shave when you come?
2016-02-08 13:06:30	yama	yes, so the plane people don't think im a terrorist
2016-02-08 13:06:31	JacolynDandreano	if i don't recognize you then you'll need to say hi to me first. :P but I'm p sure i would recognize you
2016-02-08 13:07:01	yama	no u need to say hi first
2016-02-08 13:07:55	JacolynDandreano	wow why
2016-02-08 13:08:14	yama	cause
2016-02-08 13:08:21	JacolynDandreano	why
2016-02-08 13:15:52	yama	becauuuuuuuuuse
2016-02-08 13:16:05	yama	:)
2016-02-08 13:16:47	JacolynDandreano	haha b/c you are lazy and want me to do all the work?
2016-02-08 13:17:14	yama	what work
2016-02-08 13:17:18	yama	just saying hi
2016-02-08 13:17:19	yama	:)
2016-02-08 13:17:43	JacolynDandreano	i suppose i will definitely recognize you.  she works at a deli so i will just assume that you will be in the deli often to visit and sneak lunch, so I will stop in for lunch and say hi. since you are incapable of saying hi first
2016-02-08 13:18:09	yama	maybe i'll be there to meet u and not her
2016-02-08 13:19:12	JacolynDandreano	lol you'd rather meet a friend than a girlfriend. makes sense
2016-02-08 13:19:33	JacolynDandreano	maybe you would be able to get the gf to then give me free food too
2016-02-08 13:19:38	JacolynDandreano	this is working out nicely for me
2016-02-08 13:19:50	yama	she'd probably reject me
2016-02-08 13:19:56	yama	so i'd need a friend for consolation
2016-02-08 13:20:03	yama	and consolation food
2016-02-08 13:22:49	JacolynDandreano	haha
2016-02-08 13:22:53	JacolynDandreano	no way
2016-02-08 13:23:06	JacolynDandreano	you guys will get along splendidly
2016-02-08 13:23:29	JacolynDandreano	and i will sneak scraps from your food table at the deli while you talk to her and pretend I'm not there
2016-02-08 13:23:30	JacolynDandreano	:D
2016-02-08 13:59:50	yama	yeah she looks like the type who would watch 3 hour long black and white movies with me
2016-02-08 14:00:42	JacolynDandreano	ya never know
2016-02-08 14:02:13	yama	im gonna watch The Fall of the House Usher
2016-02-08 14:02:18	yama	based on the poe book
2016-02-08 14:02:52	yama	it's 1 hour long but it's silent
2016-02-08 14:02:56	yama	do you want to watch it later
2016-02-08 14:03:00	yama	u can say no
2016-02-08 14:04:23	JacolynDandreano	:( i won't have time later
2016-02-08 14:04:26	JacolynDandreano	otherwise i would
2016-02-08 14:04:35	yama	ok
2016-02-08 14:04:55	JacolynDandreano	apparently I DO look like the type of person to watch b&w films with you :P
2016-02-08 14:04:58	JacolynDandreano	since you asked
2016-02-08 14:05:06	JacolynDandreano	but yeah i have people coming over tonight
2016-02-08 14:05:09	JacolynDandreano	so i can't swing it
2016-02-08 14:05:11	yama	well it's poe
2016-02-08 14:05:13	yama	and only 1 hour
2016-02-08 14:05:33	JacolynDandreano	haha yes i would watch any movie based on a poe book. you assumed correctly
2016-02-08 14:11:38	JacolynDandreano	why are you so quiet
2016-02-08 14:11:44	JacolynDandreano	today
2016-02-08 14:11:59	yama	im not!
2016-02-08 14:12:02	yama	i talked the most
2016-02-08 14:12:22	JacolynDandreano	no you didnt
2016-02-08 14:12:25	yama	yes
2016-02-08 14:12:26	JacolynDandreano	you've been quiet
2016-02-08 14:12:31	yama	i talked about screensavers
2016-02-08 14:13:07	JacolynDandreano	well i consider you quiet since I'm often the last one to write something and then it takes forever for you to respond :)
2016-02-08 14:14:01	yama	cause im usually the one doing the questions and u respond
2016-02-08 14:14:56	JacolynDandreano	scroll up. i responded an equal amount as you except i just write a lot more for each response
2016-02-08 14:16:15	yama	all i see is that if a girl rejected me you wouldn't console me with food :(
2016-02-08 14:18:45	JacolynDandreano	yes i would
2016-02-08 14:18:52	JacolynDandreano	i never said i wouldnt
2016-02-08 14:19:07	JacolynDandreano	but i would eat half of whatever food consolation i gave you
2016-02-08 14:19:09	JacolynDandreano	sorry
2016-02-08 14:19:21	yama	so rude
2016-02-08 14:19:40	yama	id be half consoled
2016-02-08 14:21:01	JacolynDandreano	well we would eat together tho so the other half of the consolation would be me calling her a dumb whore for you
2016-02-08 14:21:48	yama	o:
2016-02-08 14:21:57	yama	if she was a whore she probably wouldnt reject me
2016-02-08 14:22:21	JacolynDandreano	why are you going to offer her money when you ask her out?
2016-02-08 14:23:24	yama	because she works at a deli
2016-02-08 14:23:42	JacolynDandreano	that's payment for food not for grill
2016-02-08 14:23:58	JacolynDandreano	are you paying for her gf services separately?
2016-02-08 14:25:17	yama	no im just paying for the food
2016-02-08 14:26:15	JacolynDandreano	all this talk... now i want a deli sandwich and chips
2016-02-08 14:26:36	JacolynDandreano	a nice roast beef and lacy swiss with horseradish sauce and lettuce/tomato
2016-02-08 14:26:38	JacolynDandreano	OMG

2016-02-08 18:36:15	JacolynDandreano	Um well they said that the first visit is to confirm I'm pregnant and see if everything is healthy
2016-02-08 18:36:28	yama	did u tell him you're starving yourself
2016-02-08 18:37:20	JacolynDandreano	No. That will prob be next week when the results come back
2016-02-08 18:37:25	JacolynDandreano	today was just tests
2016-02-08 18:37:47	JacolynDandreano	basically I saw the baby and watched/heard its heartbeat
2016-02-08 18:37:56	yama	what do the tests have to do with telling him you can't eat
2016-02-08 18:37:59	yama	how did it feel
2016-02-08 18:38:23	JacolynDandreano	it felt cool. Except they stick a giant camera stick up my vagina lol
2016-02-08 18:38:28	JacolynDandreano	that felt....odd
2016-02-08 18:38:41	yama	oh
2016-02-08 18:38:43	yama	uh
2016-02-08 18:38:44	yama	ok
2016-02-08 18:38:55	JacolynDandreano	anyway i just met with the technicians not the actual doc
2016-02-08 18:39:09	JacolynDandreano	so it wasn't the time to discuss things
2016-02-08 18:39:27	yama	so it was several people?
2016-02-08 18:39:50	JacolynDandreano	I walked in and the nurse said "don't be alarmed at the size of this thing" and I was
2016-02-08 18:39:58	yama	lol
2016-02-08 18:40:04	yama	i could not be a woman
2016-02-08 18:41:14	JacolynDandreano	yeah I went to one place for a simple introduction and a pee test and to check my weight (I have gained .8lb this whole month which I attribute to super bowl eating yesterday). Then I went to an actual hospital for the ultrasound
2016-02-08 18:41:53	JacolynDandreano	the camera didn't hurt. It just felt weird because she moves it all around.
2016-02-08 18:42:00	JacolynDandreano	not that you want to know all this
2016-02-08 18:42:01	yama	lol .8lbs is normal weight fluctuation

2016-02-08 18:51:17	JacolynDandreano	Oh
2016-02-08 18:51:31	JacolynDandreano	when is the last time you were happy and you weren't high
2016-02-08 18:51:33	JacolynDandreano	:)
2016-02-08 18:51:51	JacolynDandreano	I missed your big high moments
2016-02-08 18:52:07	yama	i guess i was happy last night when i was playing games
2016-02-08 18:52:14	yama	i talked to u but u were busy
2016-02-08 18:52:43	yama	i was very very high
2016-02-08 18:52:48	JacolynDandreano	So playing games makes u happy
2016-02-08 18:53:12	yama	yes, specially with friends
2016-02-08 18:53:19	JacolynDandreano	high by yourself?
2016-02-08 18:53:22	yama	hanging out with my friends makes me happy
2016-02-08 18:53:24	yama	yes
2016-02-08 18:53:36	yama	i shouldn't have done it alone for how much i took
2016-02-08 18:53:47	JacolynDandreano	strange. I've always heard it isn't good to take them to the head
2016-02-08 18:54:03	yama	take them to the head?
2016-02-08 18:54:41	JacolynDandreano	Smoking alone
2016-02-08 18:54:56	JacolynDandreano	it is probably a regional phrase from near my city
2016-02-08 18:55:14	yama	oh, i didn't smoke, it wasn't weed
2016-02-08 18:55:24	JacolynDandreano	Might not even be used anymore lol. I haven't hung out with potheads in like ten years
2016-02-08 18:55:28	yama	take them to the head means smoking alone?
2016-02-08 18:55:29	JacolynDandreano	what was it
2016-02-08 18:55:46	JacolynDandreano	Yes
2016-02-08 18:55:52	JacolynDandreano	at least here it did
2016-02-08 18:55:53	yama	i did weed alone 2 or 3 times, it's not bad if you have some experience
2016-02-08 18:56:03	JacolynDandreano	Oh
2016-02-08 18:56:11	yama	well it was supposed to be lsd but i think it's mixed with another chemical, pure lsd is hard to come by
2016-02-08 18:56:20	JacolynDandreano	well if I ever do weed I'll be sure to have you around
2016-02-08 18:56:33	JacolynDandreano	Why would you take LSD alone
2016-02-08 18:56:37	yama	i'd make sure you enjoy it :)
2016-02-08 18:56:40	JacolynDandreano	that doesn't sound good
2016-02-08 18:56:48	JacolynDandreano	i didn't even know u did lsd
2016-02-08 18:56:57	JacolynDandreano	What else do u do
2016-02-08 18:57:08	yama	because i had one tab, and i had the chance cause my friend went for vacation
2016-02-08 18:57:16	yama	and i was afraid it would evaporate
2016-02-08 18:57:53	yama	i listened to music, looked at myself in the mirror, looked at the cats, looked at everything
2016-02-08 18:57:58	yama	watched into the void
2016-02-08 18:58:18	yama	had really strong visuals
2016-02-08 18:58:22	JacolynDandreano	Cool but I mean what other drugs do u do
2016-02-08 18:58:27	yama	ohh
2016-02-08 18:58:30	yama	sry lol
2016-02-08 18:58:35	yama	just those two
2016-02-08 18:58:38	JacolynDandreano	Good thing u didn't put the cat in the oven
2016-02-08 18:58:40	yama	lsd was the first one i tried
2016-02-08 18:58:46	JacolynDandreano	oh
2016-02-08 18:58:49	yama	why would i do that lol
2016-02-08 18:58:55	yama	oh i also faced a cockroach
2016-02-08 18:59:00	yama	that almst turned it into a bad trip
2016-02-08 18:59:06	JacolynDandreano	Isn't that a known myth or something for lsd users
2016-02-08 18:59:16	JacolynDandreano	they put the cat in the oven
2016-02-08 18:59:17	yama	it is interesting to face your fears high
2016-02-08 18:59:28	yama	i never heard of that
2016-02-08 18:59:29	JacolynDandreano	i don't think I would like being high
2016-02-08 18:59:37	yama	maybe it was an anti drug campagin :p
2016-02-08 18:59:40	JacolynDandreano	im paranoid enough when slightly buzzed
2016-02-08 18:59:52	yama	i think you would
2016-02-08 18:59:56	JacolynDandreano	No it wasnt
2016-02-08 18:59:59	yama	it depends a lot on your environment
2016-02-08 19:00:22	JacolynDandreano	Meh
2016-02-08 19:00:30	yama	you could be alone or with someone you fully trust, lying down, eyes closed, listening to music
2016-02-08 19:01:29	JacolynDandreano	I could do that sober too and enjoy it
2016-02-08 19:01:33	JacolynDandreano	:P
2016-02-08 19:01:49	yama	i do it too but it's not the same
2016-02-08 19:01:53	JacolynDandreano	without the extra paranoia that I'm being annoying or stuff
2016-02-08 19:02:07	yama	different substances affect u differently
2016-02-08 19:02:15	yama	and the only one you've experienced is alcohol
2016-02-08 19:02:17	yama	so u never know
2016-02-08 19:02:34	JacolynDandreano	Yes I suppose
2016-02-08 19:02:45	yama	remember i barely drink and i had the same xperience with alcohol and i dont have any desire to drink at all
2016-02-08 19:02:45	JacolynDandreano	well it isn't legal so I won't be doing it anytime soon
2016-02-08 19:02:56	JacolynDandreano	true
2016-02-08 19:03:18	yama	i dont like drugs as a regular thing like people who drink every week
2016-02-08 19:03:30	JacolynDandreano	That's good
2016-02-08 19:03:38	yama	i like it to do it as if you were taking a trip away from your usual mind
2016-02-08 19:03:49	JacolynDandreano	That's why I read
2016-02-08 19:03:58	JacolynDandreano	anyway I'm going to go read

2016-02-08 19:05:43	yama	the lsd i bought it from my friend's gf's friend, it's not as expensive as i thought
2016-02-08 19:06:52	yama	i wanted to try lsd since i was like 17, but i had it as a long term thing, and i did it when i was 24
2016-02-08 19:12:53	yama	do u want a pic of the plant lol
2016-02-08 19:23:53	JacolynDandreano	Nah I was just wondering

2016-02-09 18:34:33	JacolynDandreano	but it will be boring
2016-02-09 18:34:33	JacolynDandreano	but it will be boring
2016-02-09 18:34:46	JacolynDandreano	hmm maybe I should make that an AMAA

2016-02-09 18:36:29	JacolynDandreano	but you need to promise not to EVER share my answers

2016-02-09 18:36:45	yama	ok
2016-02-09 18:37:39	JacolynDandreano	ok you're my favorite person from IRC. I would have thought that would be obvious since we talk significantly more than I talk to anyone else
2016-02-09 18:37:56	JacolynDandreano	but I'm still counting that as a question
2016-02-09 18:38:14	JacolynDandreano	even if it was an obvious answer
2016-02-09 18:38:17	JacolynDandreano	too bad for you
2016-02-09 18:38:21	JacolynDandreano	next question
2016-02-09 18:38:26	yama	is that REALLY the truth 
2016-02-09 18:39:00	JacolynDandreano	I said I would be as honest as possible. I'm not going to do these answers if you're just going to think I'm lying
2016-02-09 18:39:10	JacolynDandreano	so yes it is
2016-02-09 18:39:33	yama	ok sry i was just doubtful cause i always thought the reason u didnt tell me was because it wasn't me 
2016-02-09 18:39:56	yama	for the record im smiling irl
2016-02-09 18:40:04	JacolynDandreano	it is because I don't like playing favorites and I wouldn't want someone else to think they are not my favorite
2016-02-09 18:40:20	yama	so you wouldn't like ME thinking it either ;)
2016-02-09 18:40:22	JacolynDandreano	oh did that actually make you happy?
2016-02-09 18:40:28	yama	yes
2016-02-09 18:40:33	JacolynDandreano	I want everyone to think they are my favorite
2016-02-09 18:40:58	JacolynDandreano	yay! I am on same level as your video games
2016-02-09 18:40:58	yama	but i can still have a little doubt because of that :p
2016-02-09 18:41:03	yama	but let me think of another q
2016-02-09 18:41:24	JacolynDandreano	doubt what you want, but I told u I would answer as honest as I know
2016-02-09 18:41:52	yama	yes but you're also telling me u want everyone to think they're your favorite
2016-02-09 18:42:02	yama	only 2 questions?
2016-02-09 18:43:09	JacolynDandreano	Yes so I don't broadcast that you're my fav
2016-02-09 18:43:16	JacolynDandreano	AND YOU WONT EITHER
2016-02-09 18:43:22	JacolynDandreano	yes only two questions
2016-02-09 18:43:32	JacolynDandreano	you can maybe get two another time
2016-02-09 18:43:34	yama	two MORE
2016-02-09 18:43:37	yama	:D
2016-02-09 18:43:41	JacolynDandreano	when I'm feeling generous
2016-02-09 18:43:46	JacolynDandreano	no two total
2016-02-09 18:44:20	JacolynDandreano	So that you can see how boring my mind really is
2016-02-09 18:44:37	JacolynDandreano	you will then realize there is no reason to want to read it
2016-02-09 18:45:02	yama	i will have to think about it more
2016-02-09 18:45:09	yama	this is too much responsibility
2016-02-09 18:45:52	JacolynDandreano	Do you forfeit your opportunity for the second question then? :)
2016-02-09 18:46:00	yama	no, i will ask it later
2016-02-09 18:46:03	JacolynDandreano	Because you're allowed to do that
2016-02-09 18:46:08	yama	to catch u off guard
2016-02-09 18:46:09	JacolynDandreano	meh fine
2016-02-09 18:46:16	yama	too bad u cant drink now
2016-02-09 18:46:17	JacolynDandreano	i should put a time limit on them
2016-02-09 18:46:28	JacolynDandreano	why would drinking matter lol
2016-02-09 18:46:33	yama	;)
2016-02-09 18:46:41	JacolynDandreano	ill be equally as honest either way
2016-02-09 18:46:49	yama	i have like 3 and i can't decide for one
2016-02-09 18:46:55	JacolynDandreano	This time you just get better spelling
2016-02-09 18:47:05	JacolynDandreano	shall I pick a number 1-3?
2016-02-09 18:47:48	JacolynDandreano	i don't see why you need to think about this. We've already played the questions game
2016-02-09 18:48:06	yama	yes but i didn't get enough answers
2016-02-09 18:48:40	JacolynDandreano	Wat you had a full day to ask any questions you wanted
2016-02-09 18:48:56	yama	but u didn't seem to want to answer questions as much as u wanted to ask them
2016-02-09 18:48:57	JacolynDandreano	Have new questions arisen since then
2016-02-09 18:49:21	JacolynDandreano	well duh. I like learning about people I take interest to
2016-02-09 18:49:21	JacolynDandreano	well duh. I like learning about people I take interest to

2016-02-09 18:50:44	yama	it's not even close to how much i answered u
2016-02-09 18:51:00	JacolynDandreano	That's because I asked more than you
2016-02-09 18:51:16	JacolynDandreano	not my fault you weren't interested in anything ;)
2016-02-09 18:51:16	JacolynDandreano	not my fault you weren't interested in anything ;)
2016-02-09 18:51:44	yama	i was interested
2016-02-09 18:51:59	yama	u were just less welcoming to the questions than i was

2016-02-09 18:57:24	JacolynDandreano	thats dumb. I can count at least 50 movies rn
2016-02-09 18:57:32	JacolynDandreano	just from the top of my head

2016-02-09 18:59:54	JacolynDandreano	which is p good for someone with bad memory
2016-02-09 18:59:58	yama	i think you'd draw a blank around 20 something
2016-02-09 19:00:06	JacolynDandreano	of course the first 8 would be Harry Potter movies
2016-02-09 19:00:09	JacolynDandreano	;)

2016-02-09 19:01:18	yama	i once thought about watching them
2016-02-09 19:01:30	yama	and then convinced myself against it
2016-02-09 19:07:42	JacolynDandreano	:(
2016-02-09 19:07:51	JacolynDandreano	my favorite books of all time
2016-02-09 19:08:23	yama	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2016-02-09 19:08:37	yama	doesn't mean they have to translate well to film
2016-02-09 19:12:59	JacolynDandreano	Well I like the films too. But especially the first one for nostalgic reasons.
2016-02-09 19:24:26	yama	i watched the first one when it came out
2016-02-09 19:24:37	yama	maybe the second too, i dont remember

2016-02-09 21:22:51	JacolynDandreano	i meant when u had it open
2016-02-09 21:23:06	yama	better than being like cummi or obie and have it there for nothing -.-
2016-02-09 21:23:13	yama	idk not living alone is what stops me the most
2016-02-09 21:24:25	JacolynDandreano	Meh that's not a big deal tho
2016-02-09 21:24:25	JacolynDandreano	Meh that's not a big deal tho
2016-02-09 21:24:31	JacolynDandreano	at least I wouldn't think it is
2016-02-09 21:25:09	JacolynDandreano	hey remember how your friend told you about some IT job or something.... Did you ever go for it?
2016-02-09 21:25:25	yama	no
2016-02-09 21:25:34	yama	he told me about another job a few weeks ago
2016-02-09 21:25:55	yama	but i want to travel before i get a job that ties me to 5 days a week
2016-02-09 21:26:19	JacolynDandreano	Eh but having a job would give you more money to travel on your vacation days
2016-02-09 21:26:37	JacolynDandreano	when are you planning to do this traveling anyway
2016-02-09 21:27:18	yama	a few months i guess
2016-02-09 21:27:45	yama	i should start researching it
2016-02-09 21:28:12	JacolynDandreano	You should plan it now
2016-02-09 21:28:21	JacolynDandreano	and tell me all about your plans
2016-02-09 21:28:41	yama	uh all i know is i want something like mountain/forest
2016-02-09 21:28:50	yama	probably will be alone
2016-02-09 21:29:15	JacolynDandreano	Like a winter lodge?
2016-02-09 21:29:19	yama	will take the kindle
2016-02-09 21:29:26	yama	idk not that cold probably
2016-02-09 21:29:31	JacolynDandreano	no friends?
2016-02-09 21:29:36	yama	i want to try lsd in nature too
2016-02-09 21:29:47	yama	well my friend who is single doesn't seem to want to take any trips
2016-02-09 21:29:48	JacolynDandreano	oh
2016-02-09 21:29:51	yama	and the other has a gf
2016-02-09 21:30:01	yama	and they just went to the beach
2016-02-09 21:30:11	yama	(the one whose house i stayed at)
2016-02-09 21:30:27	JacolynDandreano	oh because it is cheaper to split trip costs (lodging and travel expenses) when you go with other people
2016-02-09 21:30:35	JacolynDandreano	you should force them to go
2016-02-09 21:30:56	JacolynDandreano	do research and link me pics of possible places
2016-02-09 21:31:08	yama	yeah i know
2016-02-09 21:31:13	yama	sometimes i get email offers
2016-02-09 21:31:26	yama	and they're all for two -.-
2016-02-09 21:31:33	yama	like rub it in will you
2016-02-09 21:31:37	JacolynDandreano	Haha
2016-02-09 21:31:48	JacolynDandreano	yes I can see how that would be annoying
2016-02-09 21:31:57	JacolynDandreano	so open okc now then
2016-02-09 21:32:09	JacolynDandreano	find grill, bring her to trip
2016-02-09 21:32:30	JacolynDandreano	or would you rather just have quiet time by yourself
2016-02-09 21:33:06	JacolynDandreano	I wonder if you are so comfortable with yourself that having a gf around at times would bother you. Not on the trip, but just in general
2016-02-09 21:33:42	yama	i guess it would take getting used to
2016-02-09 21:33:46	yama	and also depend on the person
2016-02-09 21:33:52	yama	and the stage of the relationship
2016-02-09 21:35:37	JacolynDandreano	Maybe
2016-02-09 21:35:49	JacolynDandreano	maybe you would be happier being alone tho
2016-02-09 21:36:02	yama	uh but what if i want to cuddle
2016-02-09 21:36:08	yama	and sex

2016-02-12 13:18:33	JacolynDandreano	if it was me and i wasnt renting an apartment, I would begin by painting first. painting the walls, then the furniture if it needed it. then adding new bedding or a rug. and i would add new items last
2016-02-12 13:18:55	yama	but painting is such a hassle
2016-02-12 13:21:30	JacolynDandreano	lol

2016-02-13 11:43:43	yama	im pretty sure you have a better phone than me
2016-02-13 11:44:02	yama	you'd need to have a lot of apps for it to be full
2016-02-13 11:44:07	yama	which would be weird
2016-02-13 11:44:12	JacolynDandreano	My pics take up a lot of storage
2016-02-13 11:44:18	yama	maybe you're a drug dealer and you use your phone for that
2016-02-13 11:44:32	JacolynDandreano	for dealing drugs?
2016-02-13 11:44:39	JacolynDandreano	yes u caught me
2016-02-13 11:44:52	yama	doesnt it have like 16gb?
2016-02-13 11:45:03	JacolynDandreano	lol I dunno
2016-02-13 11:45:27	yama	i'll just keep assuming you don't want to :)
2016-02-13 11:45:30	JacolynDandreano	i don't want to download apps anyway
2016-02-13 11:45:46	yama	oh ok
2016-02-13 11:45:48	yama	so i was right
2016-02-13 11:45:49	JacolynDandreano	I don't IRC enough after work to even care to do it
2016-02-13 11:45:53	JacolynDandreano	shh
2016-02-13 11:46:07	yama	as usual
2016-02-13 11:46:26	JacolynDandreano	😇
2016-02-13 11:52:49	JacolynDandreano	What is infancia
2016-02-13 11:54:13	yama	childhood
2016-02-13 11:54:14	yama	why
2016-02-13 11:55:05	JacolynDandreano	Just wondering. I didn't know it
2016-02-13 11:55:33	JacolynDandreano	It looks like infancy. But infancy didn't fit the context
2016-02-13 13:10:22	JacolynDandreano	And I can't help u with ur decision
2016-02-13 13:18:16	JacolynDandreano	At first I thought that library looked ugly
2016-02-13 13:18:23	JacolynDandreano	not cozy features
2016-02-13 13:18:38	JacolynDandreano	but I like the idea of letting the natural light in with those sticks
2016-02-13 13:19:20	JacolynDandreano	Haha you and I have very different taste in architecture I think
2016-02-13 13:19:25	JacolynDandreano	i like cozy aspects
2016-02-13 13:19:41	JacolynDandreano	a bunch of wood with no comfortable seating doesn't look cozy
2016-02-13 13:23:05	yama	look always looks good to me
2016-02-13 13:23:38	JacolynDandreano	Well for me, when I see something I immediately think "would I be comfortable there"
2016-02-13 13:24:06	JacolynDandreano	wood can look good but it can also look stark. It needs other things to balance it out
2016-02-13 13:24:09	JacolynDandreano	other textures
2016-02-13 13:26:47	--	irc: disconnected from server

2016-02-13 22:33:17	JacolynDandreano	ok
2016-02-13 22:33:52	yama	i guess it makes me more huggable maybe
2016-02-13 22:33:57	yama	or not
2016-02-13 22:34:34	JacolynDandreano	lol if that's what fat does then I'm super huggable.

2016-02-13 22:36:12	yama	meh 
2016-02-13 22:36:20	JacolynDandreano	Wow why not
2016-02-13 22:36:29	JacolynDandreano	also I'll never believe you are fat
2016-02-13 22:36:38	JacolynDandreano	you will never convince me
2016-02-13 22:36:44	yama	you just need glasses
2016-02-13 22:37:23	JacolynDandreano	no
2016-02-13 22:37:39	yama	yes
2016-02-13 22:37:45	yama	i have no abs
2016-02-13 22:37:48	yama	therefore im fat
2016-02-13 22:37:59	JacolynDandreano	😎
2016-02-13 22:38:10	JacolynDandreano	That makes no sense
2016-02-13 22:38:10	JacolynDandreano	That makes no sense
2016-02-13 22:38:10	JacolynDandreano	That makes no sense
2016-02-13 22:38:10	JacolynDandreano	That makes no sense
2016-02-13 22:38:15	JacolynDandreano	youre a silly boy
2016-02-13 22:38:23	yama	it makes complete sense
2016-02-13 22:38:39	yama	if i have no traces of abs, i have either a weak core or im fat
2016-02-13 22:38:46	yama	i don't think im particularly weak
2016-02-13 22:38:53	yama	not that i have a strong core
2016-02-13 22:39:07	yama	but there's enough fat to cover them
2016-02-13 22:39:17	JacolynDandreano	how much fat
2016-02-13 22:39:48	JacolynDandreano	If you grab it with one hand full, is there still more
2016-02-13 22:39:53	yama	2 much
2016-02-13 22:40:00	yama	what do you mean still more
2016-02-13 22:40:24	JacolynDandreano	Like can you not grab down to your muscle
2016-02-13 22:40:57	yama	if i grab it's like a handful
2016-02-13 22:41:13	JacolynDandreano	So not more than a full handful
2016-02-13 22:41:32	yama	there's more to the sides
2016-02-13 22:41:46	yama	now my stomach hurts from squeezing it
2016-02-13 22:41:51	JacolynDandreano	haha
2016-02-13 22:41:58	JacolynDandreano	my home test
2016-02-13 22:42:07	JacolynDandreano	but is there more below your hand
2016-02-13 22:42:13	JacolynDandreano	not more to the sides
2016-02-13 22:42:30	yama	i dont think so
2016-02-13 22:42:40	yama	this sounds like a very innacurate test
2016-02-13 22:43:47	JacolynDandreano	No it is accurate
2016-02-13 22:43:52	JacolynDandreano	i deem you not fat

2016-02-15 22:43:08	yama	what are you doing
2016-02-15 22:44:01	JacolynDandreano	i wasn't trying to brag. You thought I was. And you have called me shallow before. I was just thinking about stuff in the past, but I shouldn't have told you all that. Because now you think poorly of me
2016-02-15 22:44:14	JacolynDandreano	im not mad at you
2016-02-15 22:44:23	JacolynDandreano	im just annoyed that I didn't shut up

2016-02-15 22:44:50	yama	i was just teasing you
2016-02-15 22:44:53	yama	:/
2016-02-15 22:44:58	JacolynDandreano	I don't want you to think I am shallow
2016-02-15 22:45:00	yama	you tease me all the time
2016-02-15 22:45:10	yama	it's not fair that i can't tease you
2016-02-15 22:45:22	JacolynDandreano	were you really just teasing tho
2016-02-15 22:45:29	yama	ye

2016-02-15 22:46:08	JacolynDandreano	Lying down
2016-02-15 22:46:19	JacolynDandreano	just finished dinner/dessert
2016-02-15 22:46:24	yama	how much did you read
2016-02-15 22:46:27	yama	me too
2016-02-15 22:46:42	JacolynDandreano	None? I spent all day talking to you like a crazy woman :)
2016-02-15 22:46:54	yama	what about when i left??
2016-02-15 22:47:22	JacolynDandreano	I heated up dinner and colored in a coloring book. Don't make fun.
2016-02-15 22:47:49	yama	wow
2016-02-15 22:47:49	JacolynDandreano	i may read a chapter or two in a little while
2016-02-15 22:47:53	yama	look at you
2016-02-15 22:47:58	yama	:)
2016-02-15 22:48:00	JacolynDandreano	Yes I did. I colored
2016-02-15 22:48:17	yama	i didn't think i'd know anyone who was into that lol
2016-02-15 22:48:35	JacolynDandreano	Haha I thought it was a really stupid trend
2016-02-15 22:48:44	yama	it isn't? ;)
2016-02-15 22:49:08	JacolynDandreano	but then I thought about how relaxing it would be to take my mind off things and I bought some colored pencils and a book
2016-02-15 22:49:42	JacolynDandreano	there was an article that it is basically like a better form of meditation
2016-02-15 22:49:42	JacolynDandreano	there was an article that it is basically like a better form of meditation
2016-02-15 22:49:42	JacolynDandreano	there was an article that it is basically like a better form of meditation
2016-02-15 22:49:42	JacolynDandreano	there was an article that it is basically like a better form of meditation
2016-02-15 22:49:53	JacolynDandreano	and it actually is calming
2016-02-15 22:49:58	yama	lol how is it better
2016-02-15 22:50:16	JacolynDandreano	uh I don't know. I read the first line and got bored :D
2016-02-15 22:50:32	yama	you surprise me more and more
2016-02-15 22:50:38	JacolynDandreano	-.-
2016-02-15 22:50:39	yama	you fell for clickbait!
2016-02-15 22:51:16	JacolynDandreano	yes I fell for click bait all day on FB. Didn't the heroin video clue you in? I was really bored when you didn't talk to me :)
2016-02-15 22:52:33	yama	but anyway the point of meditation is to detach from your thoughts at any moment without any external help, so if you need a coloring book i think that already makes it not as good as meditation
2016-02-15 22:52:34	yama	but 
2016-02-15 22:52:50	yama	i also think just drawing has a similar effect, it's not like thos coloring books are magic
2016-02-15 22:52:57	yama	but people don't draw casually i guess
2016-02-15 22:54:14	yama	show me what you colored
2016-02-15 23:02:27	JacolynDandreano	I don't draw because I can't even draw stick figures properly
2016-02-15 23:02:40	JacolynDandreano	and I'm not artistic
2016-02-15 23:02:42	yama	so what
2016-02-15 23:03:41	JacolynDandreano	so I color :)
2016-02-15 23:03:49	yama	pfft
2016-02-15 23:03:53	yama	well show me
2016-02-15 23:03:56	JacolynDandreano	don't be such a hobby snob
2016-02-15 23:04:04	JacolynDandreano	no my coloring is bad too
2016-02-15 23:04:09	yama	-_-
2016-02-15 23:04:14	yama	then why not draw instead
2016-02-15 23:04:24	JacolynDandreano	my drawing is way worse
2016-02-15 23:04:24	JacolynDandreano	my drawing is way worse
2016-02-15 23:04:24	JacolynDandreano	my drawing is way worse
2016-02-15 23:04:33	JacolynDandreano	i wouldn't even know what to draw
2016-02-15 23:04:35	yama	but cheaper :)
2016-02-15 23:04:41	JacolynDandreano	it looks like a kjndergarteners
2016-02-15 23:04:48	yama	a wat
2016-02-15 23:04:52	JacolynDandreano	eh the coloring book was $7.
2016-02-15 23:04:57	JacolynDandreano	shhh
2016-02-15 23:05:08	yama	wow
2016-02-15 23:05:20	JacolynDandreano	now ur just teasing me about everything
2016-02-15 23:05:25	JacolynDandreano	:'(
2016-02-15 23:05:31	yama	"i dont draw i only color on $7 books", and I'm the snob
2016-02-15 23:05:39	yama	it's payback
2016-02-15 23:05:41	JacolynDandreano	:(
2016-02-15 23:06:04	JacolynDandreano	payback for what? Did you even see that workout video I linked this morning
2016-02-15 23:06:11	JacolynDandreano	you didn't acknowledge it
2016-02-15 23:06:40	yama	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2016-02-15 23:07:27	JacolynDandreano	I feel like you're judging me all day.... My clothing was too racy, I chose the wrong coloring book, I'm not watching a cool video
2016-02-15 23:07:44	JacolynDandreano	im going to start judging you
2016-02-15 23:07:49	JacolynDandreano	you judger
2016-02-15 23:07:58	yama	i think you've been doing it for a long time ;)
2016-02-15 23:08:05	yama	i didn't say too racy
2016-02-15 23:08:07	JacolynDandreano	No but I'll start now
2016-02-15 23:08:08	yama	i was just surprised
2016-02-15 23:08:19	JacolynDandreano	why? I was a dumb kid once
2016-02-15 23:08:27	JacolynDandreano	i wasn't always sophisticated and mature
2016-02-15 23:08:28	yama	and like i've mentioned before that kinda thing makes me curious
2016-02-15 23:08:38	JacolynDandreano	curious about what
2016-02-15 23:08:53	yama	i told u when i asked about the woman from the train
2016-02-15 23:08:55	yama	do u not remember
2016-02-15 23:09:10	JacolynDandreano	uh you said a lot about her
2016-02-15 23:09:13	JacolynDandreano	which part
2016-02-15 23:09:47	yama	if she liked the attention and stuff
2016-02-15 23:10:02	JacolynDandreano	oh
2016-02-15 23:10:07	JacolynDandreano	and what did I say? Lol
2016-02-15 23:10:12	yama	i dont remember
2016-02-15 23:10:20	yama	i just try to imagine myself in that place
2016-02-15 23:10:23	yama	but i can't really
2016-02-15 23:10:52	JacolynDandreano	i didn't dress like that for other people tho. I did it for myself. Because I knew that as I got older I would never be able to wear stuff like that again
2016-02-15 23:12:11	yama	i don't get that either :p
2016-02-15 23:12:31	JacolynDandreano	my depression was particularly bad in high school and one of my biggest worries has always been about getting older and time moving too fast, so I wanted to dress like that while I still could
2016-02-15 23:12:38	JacolynDandreano	does that make sense or not
2016-02-15 23:12:59	yama	well i kinda already guessed that about you
2016-02-15 23:13:02	yama	the first part
2016-02-15 23:13:08	yama	but no the latter part not really
2016-02-15 23:13:14	yama	i mean there's 100 ways to dress
2016-02-15 23:13:16	JacolynDandreano	That I had bad depression in hs?
2016-02-15 23:13:16	JacolynDandreano	That I had bad depression in hs?
2016-02-15 23:13:26	yama	and you can technically dress however you want any time
2016-02-15 23:13:34	yama	no, about getting older
2016-02-15 23:13:45	JacolynDandreano	i wore things that were comfortable to me
2016-02-15 23:14:10	yama	why dont you wear them now
2016-02-15 23:15:03	JacolynDandreano	Because almost-29-year-olds can't dress like kids forever, and I hate my body even more, as I predicted in hs
2016-02-15 23:15:27	yama	what's kid like about jean a shirt
2016-02-15 23:15:33	yama	you're just silly :)
2016-02-15 23:15:39	JacolynDandreano	I wear jeans and shirts
2016-02-15 23:15:48	JacolynDandreano	but I don't show as much skin
2016-02-15 23:15:58	JacolynDandreano	is my point
2016-02-15 23:16:01	yama	meh
2016-02-15 23:16:22	JacolynDandreano	i wear jeans and shirts all the time tho if that's what you're referring to
2016-02-15 23:17:12	JacolynDandreano	also the style changed for a while. It stopped becoming acceptable to wear belly shirts and it usually hasn't been acceptable ever for working aged people to.

2016-02-15 23:17:13	JacolynDandreano	also the style changed for a while. It stopped becoming acceptable to wear belly shirts and it usually hasn't been acceptable ever for working aged people to.
2016-02-15 23:17:45	JacolynDandreano	And my boobs aren't a B anymore. You can't really go bra less outside of your home if you have DD
2016-02-15 23:17:55	yama	the woman from the train is older than you
2016-02-15 23:18:00	yama	and wears belly shirts
2016-02-15 23:18:12	JacolynDandreano	meh I'm not judging
2016-02-15 23:18:20	JacolynDandreano	she probably has the body for it
2016-02-15 23:18:28	yama	ye
2016-02-15 23:18:41	JacolynDandreano	last summer I had a shirt that was shorter and I wore it a few times
2016-02-15 23:18:49	JacolynDandreano	to block parties or shopping
2016-02-15 23:19:15	JacolynDandreano	but generally I don't feel comfortable with myself
2016-02-15 23:19:26	yama	:/
2016-02-15 23:19:52	yama	i still don't get it anyway
2016-02-15 23:20:16	JacolynDandreano	Dammit
2016-02-15 23:20:23	JacolynDandreano	i thought I explained it well
2016-02-15 23:20:32	JacolynDandreano	i don't know how else to explain
2016-02-15 23:20:38	JacolynDandreano	which part don't you get
2016-02-15 23:22:32	yama	ahah
2016-02-15 23:22:36	yama	idk
2016-02-15 23:22:48	yama	if i wore something that made ladies stare at my bulge and comment on it
2016-02-15 23:22:55	yama	i'd probably either get tired
2016-02-15 23:23:01	yama	or enjoy it if i kept wearing it
2016-02-15 23:23:34	JacolynDandreano	See the thing is, I don't think it was the shirts that got me the attention
2016-02-15 23:23:51	JacolynDandreano	because they always looked at my butt and commented on that
2016-02-15 23:23:55	JacolynDandreano	not other things
2016-02-15 23:24:22	yama	a young attractive girl without a bra will always catch attention :p
2016-02-15 23:24:32	JacolynDandreano	I didn't really have much above the waist germán
2016-02-15 23:24:43	yama	i don't think you get it
2016-02-15 23:24:53	JacolynDandreano	i can promise you that they always mentioned my butt
2016-02-15 23:24:57	JacolynDandreano	not my boobs
2016-02-15 23:25:26	JacolynDandreano	And I wasn't flaunting my butt at all.
2016-02-15 23:26:34	yama	so you think if you wore the kind of shirts you wear today the same number of guys would approach you?
2016-02-15 23:27:03	JacolynDandreano	No.
2016-02-15 23:27:12	JacolynDandreano	My overall body is very different now
2016-02-15 23:27:25	JacolynDandreano	my ass to waist ratio isn't the same at all
2016-02-15 23:27:35	yama	that's not what im asking
2016-02-15 23:28:21	yama	i feel like im annoying u
2016-02-15 23:28:24	JacolynDandreano	I'm saying no, they wouldn't approach me because I don't have the right body for it. It wasn't about the shirts, is my point. I'm p sure it was about my butt
2016-02-15 23:28:37	JacolynDandreano	you aren't at all. I don't want you thinking poorly of me
2016-02-15 23:29:01	yama	why would i
2016-02-15 23:29:11	JacolynDandreano	I dunno. I just dont
2016-02-15 23:29:17	yama	and why do you care what i think :p
2016-02-15 23:29:19	yama	it's more like
2016-02-15 23:29:39	yama	i look at girls, but i don't talk to them but you're a girl and i can ask u stuff
2016-02-15 23:29:41	JacolynDandreano	Uh because you're my friend? Do you not care what I think at all?
2016-02-15 23:30:01	JacolynDandreano	ok well I'm willing to answer questions for your research :P
2016-02-15 23:30:04	yama	yes, too much
2016-02-15 23:30:28	yama	what im saying is that despite having a killer body, that's no the only thing that will get guys to approach
2016-02-15 23:30:41	JacolynDandreano	Ok so what else then
2016-02-15 23:30:51	yama	the train lady is attractive regardless of what she's wearing, BUT if she shows her belly, then many many more guys will cat call her
2016-02-15 23:31:00	JacolynDandreano	maybe
2016-02-15 23:31:05	yama	even if her butt looks the same cause she's wearing the same jeans
2016-02-15 23:31:10	JacolynDandreano	because they can SEE she has a nice body
2016-02-15 23:31:10	JacolynDandreano	because they can SEE she has a nice body
2016-02-15 23:31:11	JacolynDandreano	because they can SEE she has a nice body
2016-02-15 23:31:16	yama	the shirt will make the monkeys go wooo
2016-02-15 23:31:18	JacolynDandreano	no I disagree
2016-02-15 23:31:21	yama	nah, they can still see it
2016-02-15 23:31:33	JacolynDandreano	the only thing that the shirt does is show waist to ass ratio
2016-02-15 23:31:40	JacolynDandreano	which is helpful
2016-02-15 23:31:41	yama	it shows skin
2016-02-15 23:31:56	yama	which makes the guys think it's ok to say things to her
2016-02-15 23:32:05	JacolynDandreano	same result can be achieved without showing skin if the girl has a tight shirt on
2016-02-15 23:32:21	yama	idk, it'd have to be really tight
2016-02-15 23:32:46	JacolynDandreano	and there were plenty of times where I wore a regular white Tshirt with jeans and still got talked to
2016-02-15 23:32:58	JacolynDandreano	and in winter too when I wasn't showing skin because cold weather
2016-02-15 23:33:02	yama	the same amount?
2016-02-15 23:33:06	JacolynDandreano	so I feel like your theory is wronf
2016-02-15 23:33:25	JacolynDandreano	uh I didn't keep track. It felt like the same amount all the time
2016-02-15 23:33:43	yama	we've established i'm always right
2016-02-15 23:34:13	JacolynDandreano	Nuh-uh
2016-02-15 23:34:40	JacolynDandreano	do you have any more questions for my perspective that you want to then argue about? ;)
2016-02-15 23:35:49	yama	so to make it clear you felt it didn't influence how men treated you?
2016-02-15 23:37:37	JacolynDandreano	Maybe slightly looking back on it. I definitely should have dressed more appropriately, but I didn't know better. And overall I think that guys would have treated me the same
2016-02-15 23:37:50	yama	interesting
2016-02-15 23:38:05	JacolynDandreano	because the overwhelming majority commented on my butt, my hips, things I couldn't change
2016-02-15 23:38:09	JacolynDandreano	as I said
2016-02-15 23:38:30	yama	it doesn't really matter what they commented tho
2016-02-15 23:38:47	JacolynDandreano	And the other thing is that I didn't always dress like that
2016-02-15 23:39:38	JacolynDandreano	like I said, I took my brother's jnco jeans and cut them into these punk looking shorts that went almost to my knees and wore a Tshirt with it and I still got hit on
2016-02-15 23:39:56	yama	do you have a pic of that :)
2016-02-15 23:40:00	JacolynDandreano	it wasn't a flattering outfit. It didn't hug my curves
2016-02-15 23:40:03	JacolynDandreano	no i dont
2016-02-15 23:40:10	yama	:(
2016-02-15 23:40:22	JacolynDandreano	i still have the Tshirt tho. I wear it to bed. It also has giant holes in it
2016-02-15 23:40:50	JacolynDandreano	it was my brother's old undershirt that he never got to wear because I stole it
2016-02-15 23:41:10	yama	i want to see it
2016-02-15 23:41:14	JacolynDandreano	Meh
2016-02-15 23:41:22	JacolynDandreano	it has holes in it
2016-02-15 23:41:23	yama	where are these holes
2016-02-15 23:41:25	JacolynDandreano	i just said
2016-02-15 23:41:34	yama	inb4 middle of boobs
2016-02-15 23:41:35	JacolynDandreano	uh on the stomach iirc
2016-02-15 23:41:38	yama	oh
2016-02-15 23:41:39	JacolynDandreano	lol no
2016-02-15 23:41:40	yama	no wonder
2016-02-15 23:41:41	yama	:)
2016-02-15 23:41:51	JacolynDandreano	and there were no holes until recentlt
2016-02-15 23:41:54	JacolynDandreano	recently
2016-02-15 23:42:06	JacolynDandreano	i never wore it with holes in public
2016-02-15 23:42:16	JacolynDandreano	so don't give me that sassy smiley face
2016-02-15 23:42:35	yama	why did you cut it now
2016-02-15 23:42:44	yama	you said about the shorts 
2016-02-15 23:43:11	JacolynDandreano	there were little holes and I just ripped them a little more each night I wore them
2016-02-15 23:43:20	JacolynDandreano	since it was already messed up anyway
2016-02-15 23:44:17	JacolynDandreano	the shorts? I cut them because I wanted shorts. The only ones I ever felt comfortable wearing in public because I hate my legs
2016-02-15 23:45:05	yama	it is also confusing to me to find yourself not attractive when the world is clearly telling you you are
2016-02-15 23:45:06	yama	lol
2016-02-15 23:48:12	JacolynDandreano	nah that isn't. I had really low self-esteem. Worse than now. Now I hate my body more but don't hate myself as much. So anyway I had an idea that people liked my big butt. Back then I was the only white girl who had one, and the other girls who had a butt had thicker waists. So I knew that people liked the novelty of the butt. But I was critical of myself overall. Because I don't know if you've noticed this, but if people
2016-02-15 23:48:12	JacolynDandreano	compliment me it is really hard for me to think that they actually mean it and aren't saying it for other reasons. So whatever people said about me was less important than the crappy "truthful" way I viewed myself
2016-02-15 23:49:01	JacolynDandreano	and it wasn't until much later now that I'm much fatter that I could appreciate that my body wasn't AS bad as I thought it was. Because I'd much rather have that than this lol
2016-02-15 23:49:24	yama	what do you mean for other reasons
2016-02-15 23:49:30	yama	that's like the opposite of logic
2016-02-15 23:49:44	JacolynDandreano	I didn't say it was logical. :)
2016-02-15 23:50:17	yama	if a guy tells you "nice earrings", then you can suspect he really means "nice butt, can i be in it". But if a guy says "nice butt"... he's secretely complimenting your earrings??..
2016-02-15 23:50:19	JacolynDandreano	but I just thought they had to be lying or something. And I thought all the attention was just because guys are sleaze balls.
2016-02-15 23:50:36	JacolynDandreano	Not because they liked what they saw
2016-02-15 23:50:49	JacolynDandreano	but because they were used to commenting on women in general
2016-02-15 23:51:34	yama	weird
2016-02-15 23:51:53	yama	so now that you've learned that they liked what they saw... you now do the same mistake again :D
2016-02-15 23:52:05	yama	also i did not know your butt shaped your identity so much
2016-02-15 23:52:40	JacolynDandreano	i don't know. It doesn't really make sense. But the overall idea is that I valued other people's thoughts on my body less than my own because I thought things like "if they actually saw me up close they would know I'm fat." Or "they said something about my butt because they're surprised to see a white girl with one" not because they thought I was pretty
2016-02-15 23:52:55	JacolynDandreano	what do you mean shaped my identity?
2016-02-15 23:53:05	JacolynDandreano	why do you think it shaped me
2016-02-15 23:53:19	yama	i didn't know you were so racially preocupied too
2016-02-15 23:53:27	JacolynDandreano	Uh I'm not
2016-02-15 23:53:37	yama	lol
2016-02-15 23:54:07	JacolynDandreano	but I had lots of people start off a conversation with "what's your ethnicity? Oh you're not part black? I thought for sure you were from Africa"
2016-02-15 23:54:17	JacolynDandreano	And things like that
2016-02-15 23:54:17	JacolynDandreano	And things like that
2016-02-15 23:54:38	JacolynDandreano	Stupid joke
2016-02-15 23:54:49	JacolynDandreano	and everyone thought they were original when they said it
2016-02-15 23:55:10	JacolynDandreano	anyway why do you think my butt shaped my identity
2016-02-15 23:55:46	JacolynDandreano	I'm talking about one aspect of that time period. There are plenty of other things I could say about myself then too that have nothing to do with my body or clothes
2016-02-15 23:56:55	JacolynDandreano	I feel very weird that I just talked about myself all day
2016-02-15 23:56:56	yama	well you are part african, all of us are :p
2016-02-15 23:57:11	JacolynDandreano	not my usual private self
2016-02-15 23:57:39	yama	idk i didn't think you thought about your butt and about how men saw you but i guess it is obvious that any girls would
2016-02-15 23:57:45	JacolynDandreano	if you have more questions about girls I'll answer. But I don't want to gab on and on about me
2016-02-15 23:58:07	yama	why
2016-02-15 23:58:09	yama	i like it
2016-02-15 23:58:12	JacolynDandreano	Well I didn't think about it for a while but it was brought to my attention often
2016-02-15 23:58:20	JacolynDandreano	why? Why do you like it
2016-02-15 23:58:55	JacolynDandreano	and I don't think I realized much about it until after I got older and got fatter and less attention. Then I realized how much I actually got
2016-02-15 23:58:55	yama	because i like you
2016-02-15 23:58:58	yama	and i like knowing about you
2016-02-15 23:59:13	JacolynDandreano	oh. I'd rather you know nice things about me.
2016-02-15 23:59:21	yama	well you still got it :)
2016-02-15 23:59:23	JacolynDandreano	im a good baker
2016-02-15 23:59:24	yama	tho u wont believe me
2016-02-15 23:59:30	yama	because obviously im an alien
2016-02-15 23:59:34	JacolynDandreano	no I won't :) but thanks
2016-02-15 23:59:43	yama	and i compliment u for mysterious reasons
2016-02-15 23:59:51	yama	and not the simple, logical reasons
2016-02-16 00:00:00	JacolynDandreano	or to be nice because you like me and I talk to you?
2016-02-16 00:00:11	JacolynDandreano	makes sense to me
2016-02-16 00:00:54	yama	i don't need to do that tho
2016-02-16 00:01:09	yama	u rarely compliment my appearance and im not gonna stop talking to u cause of that lol
2016-02-16 00:01:16	JacolynDandreano	aaanyway. There are better things to know about me. That I don't gossip. That I care about people. That I have a broad taste for food
2016-02-16 00:02:01	JacolynDandreano	I don't like complimenting people's appearance. I wouldn't want your head to explode from your ego gassing up ;)
2016-02-16 00:02:10	yama	i already know the obvious things!
2016-02-16 00:02:33	yama	that would be impossible, i have lower self esteem thatn u probably :p
2016-02-16 00:02:35	JacolynDandreano	Well now you know things most other people don't know
2016-02-16 00:02:43	yama	yes and i like that
2016-02-16 00:02:48	JacolynDandreano	impossible. Mine is lowest. I win
2016-02-16 00:03:02	yama	nah
2016-02-16 00:03:25	JacolynDandreano	But you don't need to worry. You look good. You just need to not be so shy and actually talk to women
2016-02-16 00:03:39	JacolynDandreano	and that's the closest I'll come to complimenting you
2016-02-16 00:04:25	yama	so generous
2016-02-16 00:04:50	JacolynDandreano	:) watch your head
2016-02-16 00:05:12	yama	im just an evidence oriented person, and i have no evidence to suggest that im atractive 
2016-02-16 00:05:14	yama	but i dont mind
2016-02-16 00:05:29	yama	i feel so sticky
2016-02-16 00:05:33	JacolynDandreano	Well maybe you're blind and should get your glasses checked
2016-02-16 00:05:47	yama	my glasses are fine
2016-02-16 00:05:50	yama	maybe a little dirty
2016-02-16 00:05:53	JacolynDandreano	OR maybe you do have low self-confidence
2016-02-16 00:06:00	JacolynDandreano	just more than me tho ;)
2016-02-16 00:06:23	JacolynDandreano	Actually that's a lie. I feel confident enough.
2016-02-16 00:06:31	JacolynDandreano	I think
2016-02-16 00:06:39	JacolynDandreano	Is it hot there

2016-02-16 00:06:49	JacolynDandreano	yes you can win
2016-02-16 00:06:54	yama	the contest... of being depressed.. yay
2016-02-16 00:07:03	JacolynDandreano	you see yourself poorly. I see myself how I really am
2016-02-16 00:07:13	JacolynDandreano	More objectively
2016-02-16 00:07:16	yama	no u dont
2016-02-16 00:07:20	JacolynDandreano	yes
2016-02-16 00:07:23	JacolynDandreano	i do

2016-02-16 00:07:52	JacolynDandreano	:)
2016-02-16 00:07:55	yama	it's like if you made a bread
2016-02-16 00:08:03	yama	and you gave me some and i said i liked it
2016-02-16 00:08:11	yama	and u said no u dont, you're just pretending
2016-02-16 00:08:16	JacolynDandreano	Lol

2016-02-16 00:08:34	yama	but i tasted it, and i know i like it, so then i learn that your judgment of the bread AND of my perception is just wrong
2016-02-16 00:08:52	JacolynDandreano	When did you taste me? ;)
2016-02-16 00:08:59	JacolynDandreano	I disagree

2016-02-16 00:10:37	yama	well pizza is already better than bread
2016-02-16 00:10:56	JacolynDandreano	Oh. Did I taste like pizza then

2016-02-16 12:30:15	yama	clearly you don't know what i think

2016-02-16 12:38:38	JacolynDandreano	they're testing the fire alarms at my job again today. so for the next hour i sit and wait for a random alarm to go off just outside my office. i have a mini heart attack every time :/
2016-02-16 12:38:54	yama	well i wasnt but i am thinking that now
2016-02-16 12:39:32	JacolynDandreano	see mine is more like seeing into the future to know what you will think a few seconds before you do
2016-02-16 12:39:58	yama	wow teach me the power of making people think things by TELLING them
2016-02-16 12:40:11	JacolynDandreano	ahaha <3

2016-02-16 12:48:02	JacolynDandreano	maybe you were just being lazy that other day
2016-02-16 12:48:08	JacolynDandreano	when you asked me all those questions
2016-02-16 12:48:08	JacolynDandreano	when you asked me all those questions
2016-02-16 12:48:08	JacolynDandreano	when you asked me all those questions
2016-02-16 12:48:27	yama	so that means
2016-02-16 12:48:35	yama	i am right in everthing that i think you think about me
2016-02-16 12:53:04	JacolynDandreano	you can read my mind but that doesn't mean you won't interpret it differently based on your weird perception of things :)
2016-02-16 13:08:46	yama	nah i am objective :)
2016-02-16 13:10:58	JacolynDandreano	nope

2016-02-16 13:24:08	JacolynDandreano	ah
2016-02-16 13:24:11	JacolynDandreano	i like stew
2016-02-16 13:24:17	JacolynDandreano	i haven't had it in years
2016-02-16 13:24:20	JacolynDandreano	but i like it
2016-02-16 13:25:38	JacolynDandreano	I'm cooking it for ten hours
2016-02-16 13:25:44	JacolynDandreano	and it's going to be so good
2016-02-16 13:28:21	yama	i still don't know what a slow cooker is
2016-02-16 13:29:02	yama	"perfect for the working mom!"
2016-02-16 13:29:24	JacolynDandreano	slow cooker is a crock pot
2016-02-16 13:30:27	yama	and it comes with it's own heat?
2016-02-16 13:30:47	JacolynDandreano	yes hold on
2016-02-16 13:31:22	JacolynDandreano	;)
2016-02-16 13:31:58	yama	wut
2016-02-16 13:32:18	JacolynDandreano	aaaanyway
2016-02-16 13:32:46	yama	I DONT GET IT
2016-02-16 13:33:00	JacolynDandreano	idk i didn't even read it
2016-02-16 13:33:02	JacolynDandreano	hold on
2016-02-16 13:33:21	yama	oh wait i didnt see the link
2016-02-16 13:33:24	JacolynDandreano	oh, that's dumb
2016-02-16 13:33:44	yama	oh ok
2016-02-16 13:33:50	yama	lol
2016-02-16 13:33:56	yama	i don't understand why it's called like that
2016-02-16 13:34:11	JacolynDandreano	eh it's a dumb name
2016-02-16 13:34:43	JacolynDandreano	which does slow cook food obviously
2016-02-16 13:35:19	JacolynDandreano	yw. i wanted to make sure you understood this
2016-02-16 13:35:31	JacolynDandreano	so that you don't accidentally use the wrong terminology in the future
2016-02-16 13:35:35	JacolynDandreano	that would be embarrassing
2016-02-16 13:37:09	JacolynDandreano	anyway, a slow cooker is basically a metal pot shaped thing that has an electric heating element inside. a ceramic pot then rests in it and when it is plugged in, it can be set to low, high, or warm temps.  Then, you can cook food in it all day. i think it uses the moisture of the food to cook it slowly

2016-02-16 13:37:27	JacolynDandreano	so you can get really tender, fall-off-the-bone meat that way
2016-02-16 13:37:50	JacolynDandreano	or get maximum flavor from soups and stews and stuff b/c they can cook for many hours
2016-02-16 13:38:05	JacolynDandreano	oh i thought you would like the slow cooker movement
2016-02-16 13:38:48	yama	how is it different than cooking food slowly on a normal metal pot
2016-02-16 13:39:03	yama	cause my mom does that, leaves meat for like 3 hours and it comes out really tender
2016-02-16 13:45:14	JacolynDandreano	well usually this is for 5-7 hours.  But, I think the big difference is that you can leave your house and it is a significantly less fire hazard.  Also, the cool part about it is that a lot of them automatically switch to "warm", so if I want to cook chicken for 6 hours, but I work for 8 hours, it won't overcook it.  It will switch to keeping it warm so that it is ready when I get back
2016-02-16 13:45:31	JacolynDandreano	also, I think maybe the way it conducts the heat might be a little different
2016-02-16 13:45:40	JacolynDandreano	but overall it probably isn't too different
2016-02-16 13:47:39	JacolynDandreano	yeah i just looked it up. it isn't really all that different.  just that you can leave the house and it is safer with you gone
2016-02-16 13:47:58	yama	i see
2016-02-16 13:48:05	yama	then i don't think that would be useful to me
2016-02-16 13:48:16	JacolynDandreano	yeah, since you are always home
2016-02-16 13:48:38	JacolynDandreano	but if no one was home and you wanted to have dinner ready when you got home, it would be quite useful
2016-02-16 13:48:45	JacolynDandreano	so for me, i use it often enough
2016-02-16 13:50:35	JacolynDandreano	and I've cooked things for 24 hours with it. which is safer than leaving my stove on for 24 hours
2016-02-16 13:51:46	yama	interesting
2016-02-16 13:53:34	JacolynDandreano	omg
2016-02-16 13:53:43	JacolynDandreano	the fire alarm just went off
2016-02-16 13:53:51	yama	run

2016-02-17 21:42:59	yama	nah
2016-02-17 21:42:59	--	[JacolynDandreano] is away: Offline
2016-02-17 21:43:01	yama	0.1
2016-02-17 23:08:46	JacolynDandreano	Lol shut up I didn't say I was attracted to her
2016-02-17 23:08:53	JacolynDandreano	do you think she is pretty
2016-02-17 23:08:59	yama	:)
2016-02-17 23:09:07	yama	yeah, not a fan of the short hair tho
2016-02-17 23:09:33	yama	don't worry
2016-02-17 23:09:37	yama	i won't steal her from you
2016-02-17 23:09:49	JacolynDandreano	The longer curly hair looks better. But she looks better than most women with short hair
2016-02-17 23:10:49	yama	it is curious that lesbians like girls with short hair usually
2016-02-17 23:31:39	JacolynDandreano	yes it is. Lots of men like girls with short hair too
2016-02-17 23:32:11	yama	is that y u like her
2016-02-17 23:33:07	JacolynDandreano	I don't "like" her. I picked her for her devious smile since I don't really know what else to look for in a girl if I need to pick one
2016-02-17 23:33:35	JacolynDandreano	so I figure the smile at least gives the allure of personality
2016-02-17 23:34:36	yama	did u imagine her smiling at u
2016-02-17 23:34:47	JacolynDandreano	No. Shut up
2016-02-17 23:35:02	JacolynDandreano	I don't think there are many people who have a look behind the look
2016-02-17 23:35:24	JacolynDandreano	most people just have basic smiles or other expressions
2016-02-17 23:35:54	JacolynDandreano	but some people, they're expressions seem to express more
2016-02-17 23:35:59	yama	so she has your favorite female smile
2016-02-17 23:35:59	JacolynDandreano	i don't know if that makes sense
2016-02-17 23:36:16	JacolynDandreano	yes maybe. I haven't really thought about different smiles
2016-02-17 23:36:36	JacolynDandreano	i like Julia Roberts too, but most people dont
2016-02-17 23:36:55	JacolynDandreano	But her smile is different
2016-02-17 23:37:09	yama	ew
2016-02-17 23:37:31	JacolynDandreano	Haha
2016-02-17 23:37:34	JacolynDandreano	:)
2016-02-17 23:37:43	JacolynDandreano	I knew you would say that
2016-02-17 23:37:49	JacolynDandreano	no one thinks she is pretty
2016-02-17 23:37:51	JacolynDandreano	but I do
2016-02-17 23:37:57	JacolynDandreano	and I like her as an actress
2016-02-17 23:38:23	yama	that's cause she's not pretty
2016-02-17 23:38:28	JacolynDandreano	I feel like I relate to her more. I'm not sure why. But I do
2016-02-17 23:38:33	JacolynDandreano	so she is my favorite
2016-02-17 23:38:39	JacolynDandreano	yes she is pretty
2016-02-17 23:38:50	JacolynDandreano	you just don't know pretty maybe :)
2016-02-17 23:40:25	yama	so you're saying you know more about female beauty than me
2016-02-17 23:43:37	JacolynDandreano	Yes perhaps. Not because I'm attracted to them but because I'm not blinded by butt and boobs
2016-02-17 23:43:41	JacolynDandreano	:)
2016-02-17 23:43:57	yama	nah she has an ugly face
2016-02-17 23:44:06	JacolynDandreano	there is this creepy old man that always stares out his bedroom window at me when I walk by
2016-02-17 23:44:08	yama	morena has a pretty face
2016-02-17 23:44:18	yama	where
2016-02-17 23:44:20	JacolynDandreano	he thinks I can't see him lifting the corner flap of his curtain but I totally do
2016-02-17 23:44:28	JacolynDandreano	in my complex
2016-02-17 23:44:31	yama	is he fapping
2016-02-17 23:44:40	JacolynDandreano	uh I don't see THAT much
2016-02-17 23:44:48	yama	do u often walk around naked
2016-02-17 23:44:53	JacolynDandreano	i pretend not to notice that he moves the curtain
2016-02-17 23:45:13	JacolynDandreano	Not outside in 20F weather
2016-02-17 23:45:30	JacolynDandreano	he also compliments me a lot for working out
2016-02-17 23:45:37	JacolynDandreano	when he sees me
2016-02-17 23:45:49	JacolynDandreano	he speaks Spanish as his first language
2016-02-17 23:45:56	yama	o
2016-02-17 23:45:58	JacolynDandreano	his accent isn't as pretty as yours
2016-02-17 23:46:01	yama	well congrats
2016-02-17 23:46:03	yama	haha ty
2016-02-17 23:46:46	JacolynDandreano	maybe the accent's prettiness is affected by looks too :P
2016-02-17 23:48:15	yama	are you calling me pretty
2016-02-17 23:48:36	JacolynDandreano	Yes. You're the prettiest girl I know
2016-02-17 23:49:05	yama	wow ty
2016-02-17 23:49:14	yama	so if i lose the accent will i become uglier
2016-02-17 23:49:20	JacolynDandreano	hey which, in order, do you find prettiest: Judy, Brittany, cheesy, vox, pomo
2016-02-17 23:49:56	yama	i havent seen pomo's face
2016-02-17 23:49:59	JacolynDandreano	no, but your new accent will not be as awesome so don't lose it
2016-02-17 23:50:21	JacolynDandreano	im not talking about attractiveness overall
2016-02-17 23:50:24	JacolynDandreano	in general
2016-02-17 23:50:28	JacolynDandreano	now tell me
2016-02-17 23:50:35	yama	what do you mean?
2016-02-17 23:50:49	yama	if not attractiveness overall then what
2016-02-17 23:50:50	JacolynDandreano	dont lose your accent is what I mean
2016-02-17 23:50:59	JacolynDandreano	rather than just face
2016-02-17 23:51:13	JacolynDandreano	taking into account everything you know about each
2016-02-17 23:51:27	yama	i haven't talked in english for a while so my accent might be worse actually
2016-02-17 23:51:40	yama	so pretty personality? lol
2016-02-17 23:51:52	JacolynDandreano	No not personality
2016-02-17 23:51:59	yama	just looks?
2016-02-17 23:52:02	yama	but without face?
2016-02-17 23:52:04	yama	so body?
2016-02-17 23:52:16	JacolynDandreano	overall impression
2016-02-17 23:52:23	yama	so including personality?
2016-02-17 23:52:25	yama	lol
2016-02-17 23:52:31	yama	you are confusing me
2016-02-17 23:52:31	JacolynDandreano	no
2016-02-17 23:52:40	yama	overall impression of body?
2016-02-17 23:52:56	JacolynDandreano	looks. But obviously you haven't seen pomo's face so you don't need to count that as part of it
2016-02-17 23:53:11	yama	oh well that makes it unfair then
2016-02-17 23:53:14	JacolynDandreano	but you have seen everyone else's so theirs should be included
2016-02-17 23:53:22	JacolynDandreano	dont argue germán
2016-02-17 23:53:31	JacolynDandreano	just put them in order
2016-02-17 23:53:36	yama	it's true!
2016-02-17 23:53:43	yama	tell me why u want to know first
2016-02-17 23:53:48	JacolynDandreano	dont act like you aren't more or less attracted to certain of them
2016-02-17 23:54:03	JacolynDandreano	because I'm curious to see if you choose as I predict you will
2016-02-17 23:54:14	yama	what do you predict
2016-02-17 23:54:41	JacolynDandreano	ill write them down and then when you show me yours in one comment, I'll immediately send who I think you will choose ok
2016-02-17 23:55:03	yama	fine
2016-02-17 23:55:25	yama	why did you not include illustrated btw
2016-02-17 23:55:29	yama	and why judy lol
2016-02-17 23:55:49	JacolynDandreano	You haven't seen illustrated's face as far as I know
2016-02-17 23:55:58	yama	same as pomo
2016-02-17 23:56:01	JacolynDandreano	she only just showed me her actual face like a week ago
2016-02-17 23:56:11	JacolynDandreano	and I don't know if you have seen her body
2016-02-17 23:56:16	yama	this test is so illogical
2016-02-17 23:56:23	JacolynDandreano	Just do it
2016-02-17 23:56:24	yama	anyway prepare your list, i will send mine
2016-02-17 23:56:30	JacolynDandreano	I have my answers ready
2016-02-17 23:56:46	yama	i guess pomo suber vox cheese judy
2016-02-17 23:56:48	JacolynDandreano	pomo, cheesy, Brittany, Judy, vox
2016-02-17 23:57:00	JacolynDandreano	Oh hmm
2016-02-17 23:57:09	yama	are you surprised
2016-02-17 23:57:16	JacolynDandreano	yes I am
2016-02-17 23:57:25	yama	by which most
2016-02-17 23:57:38	JacolynDandreano	Vox I think
2016-02-17 23:57:57	yama	they both have short hair
2016-02-17 23:57:58	JacolynDandreano	because she is the most opposite from what you like
2016-02-17 23:58:24	yama	maybe im biased by judy drama
2016-02-17 23:58:36	JacolynDandreano	Vox has short hair and absolutely no curves
2016-02-17 23:58:40	JacolynDandreano	from what I saw
2016-02-17 23:58:50	yama	and judy has curves?
2016-02-17 23:58:52	JacolynDandreano	I guess personality can bias it no matter what
2016-02-17 23:58:55	yama	ive seen none of their bodies
2016-02-17 23:59:01	JacolynDandreano	i have no idea if Judy has curves
2016-02-17 23:59:15	JacolynDandreano	i forget why but I think she has boobs
2016-02-17 23:59:18	JacolynDandreano	i may be wrong
2016-02-17 23:59:25	yama	i picture her very skinny
2016-02-17 23:59:28	yama	should i ask marc
2016-02-17 23:59:40	JacolynDandreano	Whatever you want
2016-02-18 00:00:01	JacolynDandreano	actually the only person who has actual curves was Pomo so she was the easiest
2016-02-18 00:00:06	yama	i dont care you're the one with the questions :p
2016-02-18 00:00:15	JacolynDandreano	ok next question....
2016-02-18 00:00:30	yama	oh so this is interview now
2016-02-18 00:00:58	JacolynDandreano	No it is an interrogation. Don't make me torture you
2016-02-18 00:01:12	JacolynDandreano	you never answered me... And you said you would when you got home
2016-02-18 00:01:23	JacolynDandreano	sexy, beautiful, cute, hot
2016-02-18 00:01:25	yama	oh
2016-02-18 00:01:29	JacolynDandreano	or adorable
2016-02-18 00:01:29	yama	it's hard
2016-02-18 00:01:35	yama	cause they mix a lot
2016-02-18 00:01:40	JacolynDandreano	i think adorable might be too close to cute
2016-02-18 00:01:43	yama	isn't adorable
2016-02-18 00:01:44	yama	yeah
2016-02-18 00:01:51	JacolynDandreano	so scratch adorable
2016-02-18 00:01:57	yama	i know sexy would be last
2016-02-18 00:02:09	yama	but it's also hard to pin down which is what
2016-02-18 00:02:24	JacolynDandreano	in the context you use those words
2016-02-18 00:02:27	JacolynDandreano	pick
2016-02-18 00:02:43	JacolynDandreano	Is it because of the language
2016-02-18 00:02:49	JacolynDandreano	do you not get the difference
2016-02-18 00:03:00	yama	i do but it's very rare that a girl is only one of those
2016-02-18 00:03:12	JacolynDandreano	what describing words do you use in Spanish then
2016-02-18 00:03:15	JacolynDandreano	similar to those
2016-02-18 00:03:28	yama	i dont think there's one for cute
2016-02-18 00:03:39	yama	except adorable which is spelled the same
2016-02-18 00:03:42	yama	but rarely used
2016-02-18 00:03:44	yama	for people
2016-02-18 00:03:46	JacolynDandreano	i don't know. There are plenty of girls that are cute and not beautiful or beautiful and not hot
2016-02-18 00:03:57	yama	examples
2016-02-18 00:04:01	JacolynDandreano	anyway none of the other guys had problems with this
2016-02-18 00:04:08	yama	oh
2016-02-18 00:04:10	JacolynDandreano	you find examples for each
2016-02-18 00:04:16	JacolynDandreano	oh what
2016-02-18 00:04:20	yama	i see im the last one in your list of interrogating people
2016-02-18 00:04:26	JacolynDandreano	no you're the first
2016-02-18 00:04:36	JacolynDandreano	but this was a topic in IRC like a year ago
2016-02-18 00:04:50	JacolynDandreano	and I thought you were there but I guess not
2016-02-18 00:04:57	JacolynDandreano	since you don't know the answer
2016-02-18 00:05:10	JacolynDandreano	anyway find examples of each and post them and then decide
2016-02-18 00:05:24	JacolynDandreano	i can't post examples because every girl looks the same to me
2016-02-18 00:05:37	JacolynDandreano	either ugly or pretty
2016-02-18 00:06:06	yama	lol
2016-02-18 00:06:07	yama	fine

2016-02-18 00:37:54	JacolynDandreano	im not talking about which u would rather see in a porn
2016-02-18 00:38:01	JacolynDandreano	ok geez was that hard
2016-02-18 00:38:10	JacolynDandreano	the cute wins again
2016-02-18 00:38:11	yama	or maybe beautiful
2016-02-18 00:38:17	JacolynDandreano	Lol no
2016-02-18 00:38:20	JacolynDandreano	pick one
2016-02-18 00:38:27	yama	no but it's one thing thinking who i have a chance with :)
2016-02-18 00:38:38	JacolynDandreano	no that's not included
2016-02-18 00:38:47	JacolynDandreano	assume you have a chance with all
2016-02-18 00:39:00	yama	beautiful i guess
2016-02-18 00:39:06	JacolynDandreano	Ok
2016-02-18 00:39:07	yama	it depends a lot on the individual girl
2016-02-18 00:39:15	JacolynDandreano	yes I get it
2016-02-18 00:39:38	JacolynDandreano	if she is beautiful but there is a cute, Venezuelan with a good butt you would choose the cute one
2016-02-18 00:39:48	JacolynDandreano	i was just asking in generalities
2016-02-18 00:39:55	JacolynDandreano	youre so argumentative sometimes
2016-02-18 00:40:38	yama	it's just very hard to choose
2016-02-18 00:40:47	yama	you're asking questions very difficult to answer
2016-02-18 00:40:56	yama	meanwhile you haven't answered the very first question i asked you
2016-02-18 00:42:14	JacolynDandreano	The question you gave me was way harder
2016-02-18 00:43:00	yama	nah
2016-02-18 00:43:02	JacolynDandreano	difficult for someone who doesn't talk much
2016-02-18 00:43:15	JacolynDandreano	esp about themselves
2016-02-18 00:45:22	yama	oh pls
2016-02-18 00:45:40	yama	you talked like 2 full days about yourself :)
2016-02-18 00:48:26	JacolynDandreano	The first day was because u wanted to ask questions. So I let you. The second day is because I was feeling nostalgic
2016-02-18 00:48:36	JacolynDandreano	but overall I think I'm a p private person
2016-02-18 00:49:02	JacolynDandreano	maybe u don't realize that because I talk a lot on IRC so u got to know me more than maybe some other people in my life
2016-02-18 00:49:03	JacolynDandreano	maybe u don't realize that because I talk a lot on IRC so u got to know me more than maybe some other people in my life
2016-02-18 00:49:03	JacolynDandreano	maybe u don't realize that because I talk a lot on IRC so u got to know me more than maybe some other people in my life
2016-02-18 00:49:53	yama	not just in irc ;)
2016-02-18 00:50:44	JacolynDandreano	Yes on FB too
2016-02-18 00:50:44	JacolynDandreano	Yes on FB too
2016-02-18 00:50:44	JacolynDandreano	Yes on FB too
2016-02-18 00:55:18	yama	so are you just not gonna answer that one
2016-02-18 00:55:22	yama	it doesn't seem that hard
2016-02-18 00:55:28	JacolynDandreano	It is really hard
2016-02-18 00:55:36	yama	or harder than any of the other questions
2016-02-18 00:55:40	JacolynDandreano	i have actually thought about it a lot
2016-02-18 00:55:43	yama	it's easier than the one you just asked me :)
2016-02-18 00:55:44	JacolynDandreano	no it is for me
2016-02-18 00:55:49	JacolynDandreano	no
2016-02-18 00:55:54	JacolynDandreano	not at all
2016-02-18 01:00:16	yama	what have you been thinking
2016-02-18 01:00:36	JacolynDandreano	I guess maybe it would be nice for someone to ask how I'm feeling about my life at a certain moment. Of course I may not answer fully, but it would be nice sometimes to just say it all and not be judged
2016-02-18 01:00:48	JacolynDandreano	what do you mean what have I been thinking
2016-02-18 01:01:01	yama	JacolynDandrea+| i have actually thought about it a lot
2016-02-18 01:01:22	JacolynDandreano	oh. Thinking about your first question
2016-02-18 01:01:44	yama	i know but i wanted you to elaborate
2016-02-18 01:02:11	yama	ask how you're feeling at a certain moment, what moment?
2016-02-18 01:03:09	JacolynDandreano	but actually now that you say it, I think it would also be nice to have someone randomly ask what I was thinking at an exact moment. Because sometimes I think it would be interesting to be more conscious of the daily thoughts that are usually subconscious
2016-02-18 01:03:19	JacolynDandreano	any moment
2016-02-18 01:03:29	JacolynDandreano	i just mean a specific one
2016-02-18 01:03:43	JacolynDandreano	There I have answered your question
2016-02-18 01:03:45	yama	what if you're thinking something you don't want to share
2016-02-18 01:03:49	JacolynDandreano	i think I will go to bed
2016-02-18 01:04:08	JacolynDandreano	well then it would depend on the person and how judgmental they are
2016-02-18 01:04:11	yama	i will keep your answers in mind
2016-02-18 01:04:27	yama	did u read at all today
2016-02-18 01:04:32	JacolynDandreano	i prob wouldn't share fully, but it would still be nice to have the option of sharing
2016-02-18 01:04:34	JacolynDandreano	no i didnt
2016-02-18 01:04:39	JacolynDandreano	ill read more this weekend

2016-02-18 13:06:28	yama	excluding me, if i even would get to the top 5, because you excluded yourself from yesterday's question

2016-02-18 13:09:50	yama	also it is obviously a lie that you find every male from irc equally physically attractive

2016-02-18 15:01:55	yama	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sight-reading

2016-02-18 15:03:43	JacolynDandreano	oh sight reading for music
2016-02-18 15:04:10	JacolynDandreano	sight reading is also when you are learning certain words that shouldn't be learned with phonics like "the"
2016-02-18 15:05:06	yama	never heard that
2016-02-18 15:05:08	yama	 For sight-reading of spoken text, see Cold reading (theatrical).
2016-02-18 15:06:41	yama	i want a place to sit and read outside
2016-02-18 15:06:43	yama	tho it's so hot
2016-02-18 15:08:39	JacolynDandreano	i wish you took pics of your neighborhood
2016-02-18 15:09:05	yama	then you'd have less reasons to come visit
2016-02-18 15:09:35	JacolynDandreano	id come either way
2016-02-18 15:09:37	JacolynDandreano	no homo
2016-02-18 15:10:01	yama	lol

2016-02-18 15:30:42	JacolynDandreano	what will you do all day
2016-02-18 15:32:54	yama	idk
2016-02-18 15:32:59	yama	im listening to music
2016-02-18 15:33:02	yama	workout later
2016-02-18 15:33:07	yama	if i dont die maybe a movie
2016-02-18 15:39:32	JacolynDandreano	what do you do when you listen to music
2016-02-18 15:39:40	JacolynDandreano	you literally just close your eyes and listen?
2016-02-18 15:40:10	JacolynDandreano	interesting
2016-02-18 15:40:27	JacolynDandreano	i dont do that much at all
2016-02-18 15:40:39	yama	missing out
2016-02-18 15:40:41	JacolynDandreano	but i also don't appreciate music much the way you do :P
2016-02-18 15:40:56	JacolynDandreano	what do you do tho? are you listening for specific parts?
2016-02-18 15:41:24	yama	well now im listening to new music, it's more like im listening to the headphones than the music
2016-02-18 15:42:05	JacolynDandreano	but listening for what
2016-02-18 15:42:08	yama	if it's something like classical music i try to grasp the patterns and the narrative of the piece
2016-02-18 15:42:13	JacolynDandreano	you can't be just sitting there enjoying it
2016-02-18 15:42:13	JacolynDandreano	you can't be just sitting there enjoying it
2016-02-18 15:42:13	JacolynDandreano	you can't be just sitting there enjoying it
2016-02-18 15:42:15	JacolynDandreano	oh
2016-02-18 15:42:22	yama	if it's something like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10Lan4tLZQA it's more sensual
2016-02-18 15:42:26	yama	like in senses
2016-02-18 15:42:29	yama	not as in sex
2016-02-18 15:42:38	JacolynDandreano	yes i know what sensual vs sexual is
2016-02-18 15:43:31	JacolynDandreano	this sounds odd
2016-02-18 15:43:40	yama	why
2016-02-18 15:43:47	yama	oh the music
2016-02-18 15:44:00	yama	it sounds very nice on these headphones
2016-02-18 15:44:40	yama	it's binaural
2016-02-18 15:44:54	yama	which means it's recorded to be heard on headphones
2016-02-18 15:45:14	JacolynDandreano	oh
2016-02-18 15:45:19	yama	cause it imitates the way we perceive sound in space, so you hear as if things are in specific locations or move around
2016-02-18 15:45:25	JacolynDandreano	does each headphone give off something different
2016-02-18 15:45:35	yama	did you ever hear that barbershop binaural thing
2016-02-18 15:45:39	JacolynDandreano	no
2016-02-18 15:46:29	yama	when you listen to sounds irl the waves reach your ears on different times, it's a very small difference
2016-02-18 15:46:43	yama	but your brain uses that to tell where the sound is coming from
2016-02-18 15:46:49	yama	so this kinda imitates that
2016-02-18 15:46:59	JacolynDandreano	i see
2016-02-18 15:47:14	JacolynDandreano	thats cool i guess
2016-02-18 15:47:27	yama	do you have headphones nearby?
2016-02-18 15:52:32	JacolynDandreano	no
2016-02-18 15:52:38	JacolynDandreano	they are in my car and they are the crappy ones
2016-02-18 15:52:47	JacolynDandreano	also someone is here playing loud piano music
2016-02-18 15:52:54	yama	it should work with shitty ones anyway
2016-02-18 15:52:54	JacolynDandreano	sounds like 50s music
2016-02-18 15:53:04	JacolynDandreano	well ill try some other time
2016-02-18 15:53:17	yama	you sound really interested
2016-02-18 15:53:24	yama	i can tell you can't wait to experience it
2016-02-18 15:54:39	JacolynDandreano	im not REALLY interested. but I'm interested enough to try it if i remember to

2016-02-18 16:02:05	JacolynDandreano	id think nyc
2016-02-18 16:02:08	JacolynDandreano	would be more common
2016-02-18 16:02:24	yama	uh maybe in the us

2016-02-18 16:04:41	JacolynDandreano	I'm hoping for a snow day
2016-02-18 16:05:04	yama	i want rain :(

2016-02-18 16:07:51	yama	when i left yesterday, when i was about to leave i noticed the power went off
2016-02-18 16:08:00	JacolynDandreano	y
2016-02-18 16:08:11	yama	when i was coming back home the train only got to a station before mine, so i had to take the bus
2016-02-18 16:08:26	yama	when i got here my mom told me the power came back a few minutes ago
2016-02-18 16:15:36	JacolynDandreano	yeah but why is the power going out
2016-02-18 16:15:40	JacolynDandreano	is it a weather thing?
2016-02-18 16:16:38	yama	yeah
2016-02-18 16:16:44	yama	from so many people using AC i guess
2016-02-18 16:16:53	JacolynDandreano	oh
2016-02-18 16:16:56	JacolynDandreano	that sucks
2016-02-18 16:17:04	JacolynDandreano	tho power outages can be fun

2016-02-18 16:17:36	JacolynDandreano	i like power outages. one day we had one for two days straight.
2016-02-18 16:17:50	JacolynDandreano	but it was winter so we could move all our fridge food to the snow
2016-02-18 16:18:32	yama	well you'd get a break from me if i get one :)
2016-02-18 16:18:33	JacolynDandreano	that storm was also when a tree fell on my house, my parents were at the hospital and couldn't come home, so i spent like 4 days taking care of everyone

2016-02-18 16:46:51	yama	is it like slower tennis
2016-02-18 16:48:36	JacolynDandreano	uh kinda. but chris makes it sound really fast-paced
2016-02-18 16:48:52	JacolynDandreano	or at least requiring much skill
2016-02-18 16:49:02	JacolynDandreano	apparently it isn't as much a grandma sport as i thought it was
2016-02-18 16:58:32	yama	i used to play paddle with friends
2016-02-18 16:58:52	JacolynDandreano	what is paddle

2016-02-18 23:55:08	yama	well you don't want light surrounding the screen
2016-02-18 23:55:22	yama	it's like having noise when you're trying to listen to music
2016-02-18 23:55:49	JacolynDandreano	Fine watch it by yourself then
2016-02-18 23:56:07	yama	no i already said

2016-02-19 12:03:57	yama	i was just on the couch reading next to the window
2016-02-19 12:04:05	yama	i wasn't cold but i grabbed a blanket

2016-02-19 12:09:09	yama	I'm stretching
2016-02-19 12:11:26	JacolynDandreano	no go back to blanket and couch
2016-02-19 12:11:36	JacolynDandreano	I'm reading up on how to create culinary foams
2016-02-19 12:16:46	JacolynDandreano	well yes but a lot of the recipes use kitchen equipment i don't have
2016-02-19 12:17:47	JacolynDandreano	I'm trying to find one that just uses gelatin and can be made with a whisk.  there's a bunch that can be, but i want to make a banana one so i need to figure out how to make one with a banana puree starter
2016-02-19 12:40:28	yama	sounds complicated
2016-02-19 12:44:04	JacolynDandreano	it looks like you just puree the banana and heat it up.  then, add sugar until it dissolves, and then add gelatin and whip the mixture in a bowl surrounded by ice. then let it sit in the fridge
2016-02-19 12:44:28	yama	pure carbs :D
2016-02-19 12:44:37	yama	my mom made some sweet thing
2016-02-19 12:45:06	JacolynDandreano	yes carbs. carbs are all i can eat
2016-02-19 12:45:13	JacolynDandreano	unless it is fried chicken
2016-02-19 12:45:21	JacolynDandreano	what did your mom make
2016-02-19 12:45:21	yama	why fried
2016-02-19 12:45:29	yama	idk what it's called
2016-02-19 12:45:41	yama	like a brownie, but without chocolate, and with seeds, nuts etc
2016-02-19 12:45:44	yama	so like a healthier brownie
2016-02-19 12:45:53	JacolynDandreano	b/c the crispy coating distracts from the idea that it is a moist piece of protein
2016-02-19 12:46:05	JacolynDandreano	oh that sounds good
2016-02-19 12:46:55	yama	moist protein
2016-02-19 12:47:56	JacolynDandreano	yes
2016-02-19 12:48:02	JacolynDandreano	no homo
2016-02-19 13:11:13	yama	what are you doing

2016-02-19 14:24:57	yama	lol why
2016-02-19 14:26:13	JacolynDandreano	b/c i was reading and you have dogs and i wondered how you felt
2016-02-19 14:27:11	yama	i don't think having pets really changes the logic
2016-02-19 14:27:30	JacolynDandreano	no, i suppose not
2016-02-19 14:29:27	yama	good to know you read about animal sex and thought of me
2016-02-19 14:29:29	yama	:)
2016-02-19 14:29:35	JacolynDandreano	lol
2016-02-19 14:29:39	JacolynDandreano	well i think it is gross
2016-02-19 14:43:55	yama	obviously
2016-02-19 14:46:44	yama	did you ever hear of people using peanut butter :p
2016-02-19 14:47:31	JacolynDandreano	using peanut butter for what
2016-02-19 14:48:05	yama	use your imagination
2016-02-19 14:48:50	JacolynDandreano	oh are we still on the whole animal sex thing
2016-02-19 14:49:31	yama	yes, until you change the subject
2016-02-19 14:51:03	JacolynDandreano	oh
2016-02-19 14:51:06	JacolynDandreano	k
2016-02-19 14:51:54	JacolynDandreano	in high school there was a girl who hung out with a bunch of my friends.  She was really crass and wore really low pants and really high thongs to class. lol. anyway, she told people that she gave her dog a blowjob
2016-02-19 14:52:04	JacolynDandreano	on a regular basis actually
2016-02-19 14:52:16	JacolynDandreano	i didn't like her much
2016-02-19 14:54:44	JacolynDandreano	are you off looking at bestiality porn now
2016-02-19 14:54:45	JacolynDandreano	:P

2016-02-19 14:58:27	yama	how old was she
2016-02-19 14:58:40	JacolynDandreano	17 iirc
2016-02-19 15:01:26	yama	was she like the class whore
2016-02-19 15:02:14	JacolynDandreano	personally i think we had a lot of class whores. but she was the least classy looking/acting/speaking of all of them
2016-02-19 15:02:31	yama	hah
2016-02-19 15:02:44	yama	maybe you were too judgmental ;)
2016-02-19 15:02:50	JacolynDandreano	i don't know if you are familiar with the term "white trash" or "trailer trash" but she gave off the vibe of people that were usually called that at my school
2016-02-19 15:02:52	yama	i didn't have one
2016-02-19 15:02:54	yama	yeah
2016-02-19 15:03:08	JacolynDandreano	there were no class whores in your school?
2016-02-19 15:03:24	yama	not in my class
2016-02-19 15:03:46	JacolynDandreano	by class do you mean grade? or did you have one class that you had all your subjects with
2016-02-19 15:04:14	JacolynDandreano	i had art class with the girl. she always came in late
2016-02-19 15:05:37	yama	in hs?
2016-02-19 15:06:23	yama	we call class to the group of people you share your year with
2016-02-19 15:07:51	JacolynDandreano	ok so everyone in your year, regardless if they were in your specific classes?
2016-02-19 15:07:57	JacolynDandreano	thats what we call it too
2016-02-19 15:08:36	yama	everyone in the same year has the same classes
2016-02-19 15:09:04	JacolynDandreano	really? how many people were in your year then
2016-02-19 15:09:23	yama	around 30
2016-02-19 15:09:39	JacolynDandreano	oh geez
2016-02-19 15:09:39	JacolynDandreano	oh geez
2016-02-19 15:09:44	JacolynDandreano	did you go to a private school
2016-02-19 15:09:57	yama	usually each year had an A B and C division, A had morning hours, B and C afternoon
2016-02-19 15:09:58	yama	yes
2016-02-19 15:10:15	JacolynDandreano	does argentina only have private schools?
2016-02-19 15:10:32	yama	lol no
2016-02-19 15:10:40	JacolynDandreano	what do you mean morning hours?  you only went to school in the morning?
2016-02-19 15:10:59	yama	yeah like from 7am until 1pm
2016-02-19 15:11:44	JacolynDandreano	interesting
2016-02-19 15:11:53	JacolynDandreano	did you have one teacher/room for all your subjects
2016-02-19 15:12:49	yama	lol no
2016-02-19 15:12:51	yama	room yes
2016-02-19 15:12:54	yama	teacher no
2016-02-19 15:13:39	JacolynDandreano	oh
2016-02-19 15:13:45	JacolynDandreano	no wonder you didn't have a class whore
2016-02-19 15:13:48	JacolynDandreano	with only 30 people
2016-02-19 15:13:53	yama	why
2016-02-19 15:14:06	JacolynDandreano	that's a small sample size i think
2016-02-19 15:14:19	yama	how many teenage children can you have in a room with one authority figure tho?
2016-02-19 15:15:35	JacolynDandreano	there were a handful of class whores in my class. at least when i went to public school, but we had a class of a couple hundred. maybe 500? i can't remember
2016-02-19 15:15:54	JacolynDandreano	30 kids i think is the max with one teacher
2016-02-19 15:16:49	JacolynDandreano	but we changed rooms for each subject and some people in my class took completely different classes from me. so, i had a few repeat classmates for 2-3 classes each year, but most classes were new batches of kids for each
2016-02-19 15:17:28	JacolynDandreano	and we all went for the entire school day unless some seniors had early dismissal or arrival if their schedules weren't filled
2016-02-19 15:17:52	yama	that sounds so complicated
2016-02-19 15:18:56	JacolynDandreano	perhaps.
2016-02-19 15:19:24	JacolynDandreano	it gets more complicated with the rotating schedule of A-D days.
2016-02-19 15:19:36	JacolynDandreano	so gym was only something like A and C days
2016-02-19 15:19:50	JacolynDandreano	and you had to remember which days you had it and which day it was
2016-02-19 15:20:01	yama	this is giving me a headache already
2016-02-19 15:20:03	JacolynDandreano	other kids had gym on B and D days
2016-02-19 15:20:05	JacolynDandreano	lol
2016-02-19 15:20:18	yama	i wish i had a gf in hs
2016-02-19 15:21:01	JacolynDandreano	well imagine i went from a private school from K-9 grades with a class of 5 or something close to that and then went to the big school where most kids knew each other
2016-02-19 15:21:06	JacolynDandreano	it was a little intimidating
2016-02-19 15:21:17	JacolynDandreano	why would you have wanted a gf in hs
2016-02-19 15:21:31	yama	k9? was it a school for doges?

2016-02-19 16:03:17	yama	no i just didn't expect u to use that word :)
2016-02-19 16:05:07	JacolynDandreano	oh

2016-02-19 16:52:23	yama	i like a style called techwear but it's very expensive
2016-02-19 16:52:27	yama	so there's no point to reading it
2016-02-19 16:52:45	JacolynDandreano	yeah i know that style

2016-02-19 17:02:09	JacolynDandreano	i haven't used anything but water for the past month-ish
2016-02-19 17:02:25	yama	cool
2016-02-19 17:02:28	JacolynDandreano	and my hair doesn't need conditioner right now

2016-02-19 17:02:35	yama	u should give me another hair pic :)
2016-02-19 17:02:43	JacolynDandreano	no

2016-02-19 17:03:00	yama	that's worth like a thousand images
2016-02-19 17:03:01	JacolynDandreano	i gave you a million pics
2016-02-19 17:04:22	yama	but never a video
2016-02-19 17:04:40	JacolynDandreano	you can view an entire playlist of my videos
2016-02-19 17:04:42	JacolynDandreano	:P
2016-02-19 17:04:52	JacolynDandreano	actually i shared the old handstand videos with you
2016-02-19 17:04:58	yama	but you didnt make them for me
2016-02-19 17:05:21	JacolynDandreano	my hair is still in its greasy phase since i just started with this.
2016-02-19 17:07:14	yama	what made u start
2016-02-19 17:09:27	JacolynDandreano	i spoke with my hairdresser when she cut my hair. i was talking about how unhealthy it was.  so, she said that if i stopped using shampoo/conditioner that it would be much healthier and i need to get haircuts more frequently
2016-02-19 17:10:38	JacolynDandreano	basically she said i should get a haircut after two months of the first haircut and then after that my hair would be much healthier and i could get a haircut after 4 months. and then after that i could wait even longer
2016-02-19 17:12:38	yama	as long as u dont cut it too short
2016-02-19 17:13:15	JacolynDandreano	nah i want it long for now
2016-02-19 17:13:19	JacolynDandreano	I'm used to it long
2016-02-19 17:13:24	JacolynDandreano	i just want it healthy
2016-02-19 17:19:38	yama	i might let my beard longer and start oiling it in winter
2016-02-19 17:25:17	JacolynDandreano	why
2016-02-19 17:25:34	yama	why not
2016-02-19 17:25:59	JacolynDandreano	i wasnt sure if you had a specific reason
2016-02-19 17:26:09	yama	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2016-02-19 17:26:32	yama	but i;d probably need to go to a barber
2016-02-19 17:26:52	JacolynDandreano	or at least keep it trimmed and neat yourself
2016-02-19 17:27:56	yama	i tried but idk it ends up making my face round
2016-02-19 17:29:22	JacolynDandreano	lol
2016-02-19 17:29:34	yama	that might just be cause im fat tho
2016-02-19 17:29:34	JacolynDandreano	omg thats a funny thing to say
2016-02-19 17:29:39	yama	why
2016-02-19 17:29:54	JacolynDandreano	i don't know what you meant by it exactly, but it was a funny mental image
2016-02-19 17:31:06	yama	http://popularbeardstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/full-beard-styling-tips.jpg see this looks kinda square, like following a square jawline

2016-02-20 10:19:19	JacolynDandreano	I'm ready to watch it whenever you want to start btw
2016-02-20 10:19:50	yama	ok in a bit cause i want to be not this sleepy
2016-02-20 10:19:50	--	[JacolynDandreano] is away: Offline
2016-02-20 10:20:02	yama	and i want to say hi to doges
2016-02-20 10:23:05	JacolynDandreano	Ok
2016-02-20 10:23:20	JacolynDandreano	Hug doges for me
2016-02-20 10:23:40	yama	ok
2016-02-20 10:23:47	yama	well one's too small to hug really
2016-02-20 10:23:54	yama	unless i hold her up like a baby
2016-02-20 10:23:58	JacolynDandreano	Yes
2016-02-20 10:24:01	JacolynDandreano	hug her
2016-02-20 10:27:24	yama	so about the movie
2016-02-20 10:31:44	yama	since you already know the plot, if you want to see what's so great about the film, you can imagine as if the book was as script given to you and someone told you to make it into a movie. How do you do it? How do you even start? MGM logo then cut to apes walking around? How do you explain what is happening? Voiceover narration? That's kinda lazy and he didn't go that way. So relying on mostly
2016-02-20 10:31:44	yama	images, you have to choose what to shoot, from where, when to cut, etc. So how do you make things visually interesting?
2016-02-20 10:32:00	yama	Those choices are what make a director good or bad
2016-02-20 10:34:44	JacolynDandreano	That makes sense
2016-02-20 10:51:57	yama	ok im ready
2016-02-20 10:57:13	JacolynDandreano	Sorry

2016-02-20 11:02:00	JacolynDandreano	are there any pop out things here that will scare me
2016-02-20 11:02:07	JacolynDandreano	im eating cereal and don't want to spill
2016-02-20 11:02:31	yama	nah
2016-02-20 11:03:17	JacolynDandreano	so why did he choose to have a giant dark screen for the first part
2016-02-20 11:03:28	JacolynDandreano	or do you not want me to talk during this
2016-02-20 11:04:13	JacolynDandreano	random logo. Ok
2016-02-20 11:06:22	yama	u can talk i might just take a bit to respond :)
2016-02-20 11:06:30	yama	but i'll answer that later
2016-02-20 11:06:37	JacolynDandreano	K
2016-02-20 11:10:06	JacolynDandreano	that river is more like a puddle
2016-02-20 11:10:19	yama	haha yeah
2016-02-20 11:10:20	JacolynDandreano	i thought it was supposed to be a stream or something
2016-02-20 11:10:39	yama	iirc he says it's barely a river that often dries up
2016-02-20 11:10:45	JacolynDandreano	oh
2016-02-20 11:10:50	yama	but the movie doesn't have to follow it exactly
2016-02-20 11:10:52	JacolynDandreano	well he also said they didn't cross it
2016-02-20 11:10:59	JacolynDandreano	true
2016-02-20 11:11:09	yama	the important thing is to show the scarcity that they fight over a poodle
2016-02-20 11:11:40	JacolynDandreano	well how is the viewer supposed to know they are fighting over the puddle. He should have showed them drinking it
2016-02-20 11:11:54	JacolynDandreano	it just looks like they are being dumb apes
2016-02-20 11:12:01	yama	btw this was made in 1968 so no CGI
2016-02-20 11:12:12	yama	they fought and then they drank
2016-02-20 11:12:33	JacolynDandreano	what does that mean? No cgi. This is all actual apes in some desert
2016-02-20 11:12:33	JacolynDandreano	what does that mean? No cgi. This is all actual apes in some desert
2016-02-20 11:12:33	JacolynDandreano	what does that mean? No cgi. This is all actual apes in some desert
2016-02-20 11:12:36	yama	and they ARE dumb apes :)
2016-02-20 11:12:41	JacolynDandreano	with a real cheetah
2016-02-20 11:13:32	JacolynDandreano	obv the apes are people
2016-02-20 11:13:43	JacolynDandreano	also I thought the pillar was bigger
2016-02-20 11:16:20	yama	monolith
2016-02-20 11:16:44	JacolynDandreano	Same thing
2016-02-20 11:18:17	JacolynDandreano	ew
2016-02-20 11:27:08	yama	first lines of dialogue 25mins in :p
2016-02-20 11:27:29	JacolynDandreano	Yes I see now why I thought this was boring at 8 years old :P
2016-02-20 11:28:35	yama	but every shot it so beautiful it speaks for itself!
2016-02-20 11:28:50	yama	maybe you needed glasses as a kid :)
2016-02-20 11:28:58	JacolynDandreano	haha
2016-02-20 11:29:17	JacolynDandreano	nah I wasn't interested in random apes screaming at each other
2016-02-20 11:29:30	JacolynDandreano	how do they create the background with the moon
2016-02-20 11:30:39	yama	i have no idea
2016-02-20 11:30:59	yama	they're not random apes! they're the beginning of humanity!
2016-02-20 11:31:41	yama	but i think that scene was to show the instant communication with earth, something that with the internet we probably take for granted now
2016-02-20 11:32:21	JacolynDandreano	Yep.
2016-02-20 11:36:50	JacolynDandreano	And that underwear line is why thongs were invented
2016-02-20 11:37:08	yama	lol
2016-02-20 11:37:29	yama	i didn't pay as much attention to her butt as you :)
2016-02-20 11:37:44	JacolynDandreano	dont lie
2016-02-20 11:39:31	yama	it wasn't nice enough to catch my eye
2016-02-20 11:39:35	yama	but it caught yours
2016-02-20 11:40:11	JacolynDandreano	No. But since I started working out more in the past 3 years I have definitely analyzed bodies more
2016-02-20 11:40:19	JacolynDandreano	noticed bodies more I mean
2016-02-20 11:40:39	yama	analyzed ;)
2016-02-20 11:40:57	JacolynDandreano	shhhhh
2016-02-20 11:48:43	yama	ugh im hungry
2016-02-20 11:48:47	yama	i want space sandwiches
2016-02-20 11:50:01	yama	and coffee
2016-02-20 11:50:06	JacolynDandreano	No they don't look good
2016-02-20 11:50:16	JacolynDandreano	but I want a regular sandwich and coffee
2016-02-20 11:56:21	yama	i gotta pee -.-
2016-02-20 11:57:09	JacolynDandreano	Should we pause
2016-02-20 11:57:17	yama	yeah
2016-02-20 11:57:18	yama	brb
2016-02-20 11:57:24	JacolynDandreano	Ok
2016-02-20 11:57:34	JacolynDandreano	paused on the part where he is running laps
2016-02-20 12:00:24	yama	im gonna have lunch so back in 15min
2016-02-20 12:00:58	JacolynDandreano	Ok

2016-02-20 12:37:40	JacolynDandreano	I can't help it
2016-02-20 12:37:49	JacolynDandreano	the camera angle is right up against it
2016-02-20 12:39:11	JacolynDandreano	Yum space food
2016-02-20 12:41:31	yama	one difference with the book is that the mission is to Jupiter, not to Saturn
2016-02-20 12:41:41	JacolynDandreano	Oh
2016-02-20 12:42:00	JacolynDandreano	maybe to save time
2016-02-20 12:42:55	yama	yeah
2016-02-20 12:43:11	yama	i love how minimalist the representation of HAL is
2016-02-20 12:43:41	JacolynDandreano	Instead of what?
2016-02-20 12:44:13	yama	dunno a big screen with a face :p 
2016-02-20 12:44:41	yama	or a sort of robot maybe attached to the ship
2016-02-20 12:45:16	JacolynDandreano	Oh
2016-02-20 12:47:48	JacolynDandreano	Creep
2016-02-20 12:47:57	JacolynDandreano	drawing people when sleeping
2016-02-20 12:49:53	yama	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2016-02-20 12:49:57	yama	he must be really bored
2016-02-20 12:50:20	JacolynDandreano	True
2016-02-20 12:50:26	JacolynDandreano	i would go crazy
2016-02-20 12:51:08	yama	well you also have a mission and a goal so that makes it more bearable i suppose
2016-02-20 12:51:12	JacolynDandreano	nooooo don't listen to hiiiiim
2016-02-20 12:53:05	JacolynDandreano	Does Argentina have a big space program like nasa
2016-02-20 12:54:09	yama	lol no
2016-02-20 12:54:25	JacolynDandreano	i was holding my breath because of all the breathing for some reason
2016-02-20 12:54:28	yama	but we have a few satellites iirc
2016-02-20 12:57:32	JacolynDandreano	Oh the suspense
2016-02-20 13:08:13	JacolynDandreano	Why intermission
2016-02-20 13:08:17	yama	damn i should've peed at the intermission
2016-02-20 13:08:26	yama	i think people on theater got a break
2016-02-20 13:08:29	yama	theaters
2016-02-20 13:08:30	JacolynDandreano	should we pause
2016-02-20 13:08:40	yama	if u want to pee
2016-02-20 13:08:46	JacolynDandreano	No
2016-02-20 13:09:02	yama	ok
2016-02-20 13:13:05	yama	rip
2016-02-20 13:13:28	JacolynDandreano	:'(
2016-02-20 13:13:28	JacolynDandreano	:'(
2016-02-20 13:13:28	JacolynDandreano	:'(
2016-02-20 13:40:10	JacolynDandreano	Was there a remake of this movie
2016-02-20 13:52:25	yama	no
2016-02-20 13:52:48	yama	i think there's a sequel that no one cares about
2016-02-20 13:52:59	JacolynDandreano	Lol
2016-02-20 13:54:21	JacolynDandreano	Bathtub too shallow
2016-02-20 13:55:27	JacolynDandreano	what the
2016-02-20 14:01:25	yama	:)
2016-02-20 14:01:41	JacolynDandreano	What an odd movie/book
2016-02-20 14:01:48	yama	so good
2016-02-20 14:02:00	yama	were you too bored
2016-02-20 14:02:38	JacolynDandreano	No
2016-02-20 14:02:50	yama	yay
2016-02-20 14:03:01	JacolynDandreano	i don't think I'd watch it as many times as you tho :P
2016-02-20 14:04:00	yama	i cant not watch it on drugs at least once
2016-02-20 14:04:46	yama	when you asked about the black screen at the beginning, there's not one right answer but i think it's safe to say you're basically looking directly at the monolith
2016-02-20 14:05:13	JacolynDandreano	That's an interesting take
2016-02-20 14:05:35	yama	as you can guess this is much more open to interpretation than the book :p
2016-02-20 14:05:53	JacolynDandreano	Sure
2016-02-20 14:07:07	yama	did you like it
2016-02-20 14:09:08	JacolynDandreano	Yeah
2016-02-20 14:09:14	JacolynDandreano	interesting visuals
2016-02-20 14:09:26	JacolynDandreano	the music got a bit repetitive toward the end tho
2016-02-20 14:09:45	JacolynDandreano	and i am not used to the slow pace
2016-02-20 14:09:53	yama	I know
2016-02-20 14:10:21	yama	you can watch Interstellar next to see how different, fast and loud it is :p
2016-02-20 14:10:33	yama	and how much it relies on dialogue to make sure you understand everything
2016-02-20 14:10:33	JacolynDandreano	Haha nah
2016-02-20 14:11:41	JacolynDandreano	Meh
2016-02-20 14:14:17	yama	i really wish i can see it on the big screen once :(

2016-02-21 00:13:27	yama	you should show me
2016-02-21 00:13:53	JacolynDandreano	I sleep in loose fetal position always :P so I'm used to it
2016-02-21 00:14:05	JacolynDandreano	Nah all the lights are off.
2016-02-21 00:14:14	yama	i want a bigger bed
2016-02-21 00:14:48	JacolynDandreano	No small beds are cozy
2016-02-21 00:14:57	JacolynDandreano	learn to sleep in fetal position like me
2016-02-21 00:15:11	yama	im trying not to sleep on my sides
2016-02-21 00:15:23	JacolynDandreano	Silliness
2016-02-21 00:15:26	yama	cause it's not good for the arms
2016-02-21 00:15:36	JacolynDandreano	Meh
2016-02-21 00:15:59	yama	i also sleep face down sometimes and i put my arm under the pillow
2016-02-21 00:16:24	JacolynDandreano	I used to do that as a teen
2016-02-21 00:16:48	JacolynDandreano	i like side sleeping but I extend my top leg farther out
2016-02-21 00:16:53	yama	why as a teen
2016-02-21 00:17:05	JacolynDandreano	so I'm kinda twisted halfway on my stomach
2016-02-21 00:17:16	JacolynDandreano	because I was comfortable like that for a while
2016-02-21 00:17:56	yama	im having trouble imagining that
2016-02-21 00:18:35	JacolynDandreano	Go on your side. And then instead of having the top leg on top of your other leg, pull it forward onto the bed
2016-02-21 00:19:14	yama	like a bit?
2016-02-21 00:19:21	JacolynDandreano	top hip rotates down closer to the bed
2016-02-21 00:19:33	JacolynDandreano	what do you mean a bit
2016-02-21 00:19:45	yama	how much forward
2016-02-21 00:19:55	yama	cause too much and my foot would end up outside the bed
2016-02-21 00:20:21	JacolynDandreano	well I usually do slightly less than 90 degrees
2016-02-21 00:20:42	JacolynDandreano	but I wouldn't do it with foot completely off the bed
2016-02-21 00:21:05	yama	well your bed is bigger
2016-02-21 00:21:07	yama	and you're smaller
2016-02-21 00:21:15	JacolynDandreano	I'm larger
2016-02-21 00:21:20	JacolynDandreano	widthwise
2016-02-21 00:21:21	yama	nah
2016-02-21 00:21:26	JacolynDandreano	Yes
2016-02-21 00:21:26	yama	you're tiny
2016-02-21 00:21:33	JacolynDandreano	measure your hips
2016-02-21 00:21:38	JacolynDandreano	i bet you're wrong
2016-02-21 00:22:27	yama	i measured with pants cause lazy
2016-02-21 00:22:30	yama	96cm
2016-02-21 00:23:05	yama	37.8 inches
2016-02-21 00:23:14	JacolynDandreano	My hips are 107.95cm
2016-02-21 00:23:24	JacolynDandreano	according to google
2016-02-21 00:23:34	yama	prove it
2016-02-21 00:23:38	JacolynDandreano	how
2016-02-21 00:23:46	yama	pic
2016-02-21 00:23:48	JacolynDandreano	my hips are 42"
2016-02-21 00:23:52	JacolynDandreano	maybe later
2016-02-21 00:23:54	yama	but anyway that has nothing to do with your legs
2016-02-21 00:23:58	JacolynDandreano	im not moving anymore
2016-02-21 00:24:26	JacolynDandreano	i can't believe I'm that much bigger than you. I mean I knew you were smaller but I didn't think that much smaller
2016-02-21 00:24:26	JacolynDandreano	i can't believe I'm that much bigger than you. I mean I knew you were smaller but I didn't think that much smaller
2016-02-21 00:24:32	JacolynDandreano	now I feel like whale
2016-02-21 00:24:44	yama	maybe i measured at the wrong spot
2016-02-21 00:24:59	JacolynDandreano	Just measure at widest
2016-02-21 00:25:06	yama	but i didnt feel like pulling down my pants
2016-02-21 00:25:08	JacolynDandreano	but that was with pants on :/
2016-02-21 00:25:23	JacolynDandreano	so it would be an even larger diff
2016-02-21 00:25:24	yama	well i squeezed the tape to compensate for pants
2016-02-21 00:25:30	JacolynDandreano	what is your waist
2016-02-21 00:25:50	yama	like 88something
2016-02-21 00:26:02	yama	i'll measure tomorrow
2016-02-21 00:26:30	JacolynDandreano	Ok
2016-02-21 00:26:31	yama	i was 77.8kg today :/
2016-02-21 00:26:53	JacolynDandreano	I don't even want to see how much I am
2016-02-21 00:27:06	JacolynDandreano	do you consider 77.8 bad for a guy?
2016-02-21 00:27:23	yama	for a guy who's been on a cut for this long yes
2016-02-21 00:27:29	yama	but it's weird
2016-02-21 00:27:38	yama	cause i only weigh myself on my friend's scale
2016-02-21 00:27:49	yama	so it's very erratic when and the circumstances
2016-02-21 00:27:56	yama	once i was 82
2016-02-21 00:28:03	yama	then almost 85
2016-02-21 00:28:20	yama	then the weekend i did lsd i was 77.2
2016-02-21 00:28:28	JacolynDandreano	So maybe it is just wrong and you should stop feeling sad
2016-02-21 00:28:34	yama	but i was pretty dehydrated and hadnt had dinner
2016-02-21 00:28:43	yama	nah, mine is totally wrong but his scale works fine
2016-02-21 00:29:43	JacolynDandreano	That you know of

2016-02-21 00:33:00	JacolynDandreano	No. I want you to be weak and fat so that I can feel better about myseld
2016-02-21 00:34:49	JacolynDandreano	I guess I'll go to bed now

2016-02-23 15:08:02	yama	nah they're not very accurate

2016-02-23 15:08:25	yama	there's a more accurate one but requires another person
2016-02-23 15:08:41	yama	to measure the back
2016-02-23 15:08:44	JacolynDandreano	so have him check

2016-02-23 17:49:42	JacolynDandreano	also i wasnt asking
2016-02-23 17:49:44	JacolynDandreano	i was stating

2016-02-25 12:20:32	JacolynDandreano	that was totally the point of the post
2016-02-25 12:20:35	yama	i'll try
2016-02-25 12:20:35	--	[JacolynDandreano] is away: Offline
2016-02-25 12:20:52	yama	i'll try to be short and 14
2016-02-25 12:20:57	yama	so i dont scare off womem
2016-02-25 12:21:19	yama	what i got from the post was that women judge based on appearance rather than on behavior :)
2016-02-25 12:22:47	JacolynDandreano	haha
2016-02-25 12:22:59	JacolynDandreano	im p sure it is both
2016-02-25 12:23:04	JacolynDandreano	and only from necessity
2016-02-25 12:23:34	yama	sounds very fair :p
2016-02-25 12:24:00	JacolynDandreano	it is like seeing someone near you holding a gun or a knife.  it poses a threat b/c you know you won't be able to defend yourself as easily.  Even if the person has no plans to use either of them
2016-02-25 12:24:34	JacolynDandreano	but you wouldn't understand b/c you wouldn't need to worry about that
2016-02-25 12:24:40	yama	so you feel threatened when you see a policeman or a butcher?
2016-02-25 12:24:54	yama	do you think i've not encountered men bigger than me? 
2016-02-25 12:25:22	yama	the reason i don't feel threatened is the same way i don't feel threatened walking next to cars
2016-02-25 12:25:30	JacolynDandreano	?
2016-02-25 12:25:34	yama	a car could fuck you up way faster and worse than a 6" man
2016-02-25 12:25:35	JacolynDandreano	b/c you are a guy
2016-02-25 12:25:50	yama	no
2016-02-25 12:25:54	yama	when you cross the street
2016-02-25 12:26:07	yama	why dont you feel threatened by cars?
2016-02-25 12:26:09	yama	or do you?
2016-02-25 12:26:25	JacolynDandreano	b/c you look both ways and judge that they are far enough away from you
2016-02-25 12:26:33	JacolynDandreano	and that they are not moving
2016-02-25 12:27:13	yama	they could start moving
2016-02-25 12:27:17	yama	before you get out of the way
2016-02-25 12:27:31	yama	also
2016-02-25 12:27:34	yama	this applies to driving
2016-02-25 12:27:35	JacolynDandreano	well thats why you need to be alert
2016-02-25 12:27:57	JacolynDandreano	if i see a car far away but it is headed towards me and the driver is looking out the window, the threat is more serious
2016-02-25 12:27:59	yama	any time, the car in front of you could stop, or the one beside or behind you speed up
2016-02-25 12:28:11	yama	yes, because you see behavior
2016-02-25 12:28:15	JacolynDandreano	yeah thats why you need to be vigilant
2016-02-25 12:28:21	yama	we're talking about no threatening behavior whatsoever
2016-02-25 12:28:29	JacolynDandreano	yeah you need to be vigilant when you walk by guys on a street
2016-02-25 12:29:03	yama	but following the analogy
2016-02-25 12:29:13	JacolynDandreano	germán most guys aren't going to give you many signs that they are about to grab you
2016-02-25 12:29:25	JacolynDandreano	women look for the signs
2016-02-25 12:29:32	yama	it's like every time you have a car nearby while you're driving, you'd be "whew thank go these 15 cars didn't crash into me"
2016-02-25 12:29:40	JacolynDandreano	but they also aren't going to be dumb enough to run in the dark in a back alley or something
2016-02-25 12:29:50	JacolynDandreano	it isn't like that
2016-02-25 12:30:15	JacolynDandreano	i have no problem running past a guy who briefly nods as he walks past and then continues with whatever he is doing
2016-02-25 12:30:48	yama	strangers nod to you?
2016-02-25 12:31:05	JacolynDandreano	but if I'm on a less busy road or at night and i have to be in close proximity with a guy and they're already paying close attention to me then that puts up warning flags
2016-02-25 12:31:16	JacolynDandreano	yes do strangers not nod to you?
2016-02-25 12:31:24	yama	no?
2016-02-25 12:31:33	JacolynDandreano	ok well strangers nod to me
2016-02-25 12:31:38	yama	everyone would have neck problems if they nodded at everyone they see on the street
2016-02-25 12:31:38	JacolynDandreano	if we pass each other
2016-02-25 12:31:38	yama	lol
2016-02-25 12:31:44	JacolynDandreano	haha
2016-02-25 12:31:52	yama	i mean i walk by literally hundreds of people when i go to work
2016-02-25 12:31:54	JacolynDandreano	well I'm not in manhattan tho
2016-02-25 12:32:06	JacolynDandreano	if i run a half mile strip i may pass 4 people
2016-02-25 12:32:31	JacolynDandreano	im in a suburb
2016-02-25 12:32:34	JacolynDandreano	not a city
2016-02-25 12:32:44	JacolynDandreano	no one nods to me in NYC
2016-02-25 12:32:44	JacolynDandreano	no one nods to me in NYC
2016-02-25 12:33:06	JacolynDandreano	but here people either ignore you or smile and sometimes nod
2016-02-25 12:33:40	yama	well my house is not in a city either
2016-02-25 12:33:56	JacolynDandreano	then there are guys who call at you and stare you down from a distance and turn their bodies with you as you pass and may even start to step forward when they do it.  that is the difference
2016-02-25 12:34:23	yama	but that is behavior
2016-02-25 12:34:27	JacolynDandreano	i purposely don't wear a hood when i run b/c i can't see as easily if some guy is going to follow me
2016-02-25 12:34:47	JacolynDandreano	yeah but if a 10 year old did the same behavior it wouldn't bother me slightly
2016-02-25 12:34:58	JacolynDandreano	b/c they don't have the muscles or height
2016-02-25 12:35:06	yama	but with a hoodie maybe they wouldnt know you have a pretty face
2016-02-25 12:35:07	JacolynDandreano	so thats why i said that it depends on both
2016-02-25 12:35:20	JacolynDandreano	im p sure they don't care about the face
2016-02-25 12:35:22	yama	ye but that story seemed to imply looks alone
2016-02-25 12:35:39	JacolynDandreano	no it implies that the looks play a factor
2016-02-25 12:35:40	yama	well i do
2016-02-25 12:36:18	JacolynDandreano	it isn't just that the first guy was taller than her that made him creepy
2016-02-25 12:36:27	JacolynDandreano	guys sometimes give off creepy vibes
2016-02-25 12:36:32	JacolynDandreano	in the way that they stare
2016-02-25 12:36:37	JacolynDandreano	or their mannerisms
2016-02-25 12:36:45	yama	well there's no mention of that
2016-02-25 12:36:54	JacolynDandreano	clearly there isnt
2016-02-25 12:37:02	yama	only height and "rough"
2016-02-25 12:37:07	yama	so only looks
2016-02-25 12:37:17	JacolynDandreano	b/c the whole point is that the guy was so oblivious that he didn't notice how creepy the guy would look to the girl
2016-02-25 12:37:31	JacolynDandreano	but the girl has to be aware of those things
2016-02-25 12:37:32	yama	we don't even know if he looked at her
2016-02-25 12:37:41	JacolynDandreano	all the guy noticed is that the guy looked tall and a bit rough
2016-02-25 12:37:46	JacolynDandreano	the girl said he looked creepy
2016-02-25 12:37:50	JacolynDandreano	theres a diff
2016-02-25 12:37:54	yama	yes, all looks
2016-02-25 12:37:58	yama	no mention of behavior
2016-02-25 12:38:11	JacolynDandreano	but the creepiness implies some type of odd vibe that she got
2016-02-25 12:38:15	yama	nah
2016-02-25 12:38:19	JacolynDandreano	yes
2016-02-25 12:38:22	yama	that's assumption
2016-02-25 12:38:23	yama	no
2016-02-25 12:38:27	JacolynDandreano	you are speaking about things you know nothing about
2016-02-25 12:38:28	yama	it's the same as RBF
2016-02-25 12:38:37	yama	you are too! cause you're assuming
2016-02-25 12:38:47	JacolynDandreano	sure but it is in a girl's best interest to be vigilant and go with her instincts
2016-02-25 12:38:52	yama	maybe the guy has creepy resting face syndrome
2016-02-25 12:38:56	JacolynDandreano	haha
2016-02-25 12:39:00	JacolynDandreano	he could!
2016-02-25 12:39:06	yama	well that's my point!
2016-02-25 12:39:11	JacolynDandreano	but it is important for the girl to analyze it and decide on the risk
2016-02-25 12:39:28	yama	meh
2016-02-25 12:39:41	JacolynDandreano	yes
2016-02-25 12:39:51	JacolynDandreano	you wouldn't know b/c that never happened to you
2016-02-25 12:40:03	JacolynDandreano	at least i assume it hasnt
2016-02-25 12:40:13	yama	it has with mugging
2016-02-25 12:40:59	yama	but to judge based on height and "rough" alone imo is barely any different than judging on skin color
2016-02-25 12:44:35	JacolynDandreano	Listen, potentially, all strange men pose a threat to women.  Women are aware of this and therefore will often need to analyze.  They will subconsciously ask themselves what are the factors that would increase the threat (and then do the opposite) and if this threat becomes an actual danger, how much of a disadvantage am i at
2016-02-25 12:45:11	yama	every one can pose a threat to anyone
2016-02-25 12:45:25	JacolynDandreano	yes, but it isn't the same
2016-02-25 12:45:49	JacolynDandreano	YOU don't need to walk around judging girls intentions and whether or not they will grab you if you get too close
2016-02-25 12:46:12	yama	i do need to do it for men and even kids in regards to being robbed
2016-02-25 12:46:24	yama	or attacked
2016-02-25 12:46:34	yama	i've been around homeless drunk, shouting dudes
2016-02-25 12:47:44	yama	last night i witnessed two guys almost break into a fist fight, a drunk shirtless old man, a dubious looking kid stealing a cellphone from a guy and then jumping off the train in movement
2016-02-25 12:48:14	JacolynDandreano	ok well then you probably know if some bigger men that look like thugs are standing by a street corner at night in a less crowded place with little traffic going by, you may decide not to walk right next to them.  or you might think about what to do if they start approaching you
2016-02-25 12:48:19	yama	this was after the train was delayed for 1 hour because someone fell or was crushed by one
2016-02-25 12:48:29	yama	point being, threats are potentially everywhere :p
2016-02-25 12:48:34	JacolynDandreano	yes i know
2016-02-25 12:48:55	yama	yes if they approach me i'd feel threatened
2016-02-25 12:48:58	JacolynDandreano	that doesn't mean you just ignore something that looks threatening
2016-02-25 12:49:13	yama	if they're shouting or doing hot headed things maybe too
2016-02-25 12:49:19	yama	but that like i said is behavior
2016-02-25 12:49:21	JacolynDandreano	no, even if they didn't approach, would you feel completely nonchalant walking a few cm from them?
2016-02-25 12:49:30	JacolynDandreano	without thinking once that they might do somerthing
2016-02-25 12:49:44	JacolynDandreano	the danger would never even cross your mind?
2016-02-25 12:49:47	yama	if they're not acting weird?
2016-02-25 12:49:51	JacolynDandreano	b/c i think that is foolish
2016-02-25 12:49:59	JacolynDandreano	let's say they are looking at you but not saying anything
2016-02-25 12:50:08	JacolynDandreano	watching as you approach
2016-02-25 12:53:36	yama	im a shy person
2016-02-25 12:53:48	JacolynDandreano	so?
2016-02-25 12:53:57	JacolynDandreano	would you feel perfectly fine walking by
2016-02-25 12:53:57	yama	even in the safest place in the world, if several people are looking at me at the same time i'd feel uncofortable
2016-02-25 12:54:09	JacolynDandreano	meh
2016-02-25 12:54:12	yama	i'd think there's something wrong with me
2016-02-25 12:54:25	yama	but again, that's behavior :p
2016-02-25 12:54:32	yama	being tall is not something you can avoid
2016-02-25 12:54:34	JacolynDandreano	i bet you'd feel more uncomfortable depending on how they looked and how dark it was and what part of town it was
2016-02-25 12:54:44	JacolynDandreano	nothing wrong with being tall
2016-02-25 12:55:05	JacolynDandreano	but if you are tall and in close proximity and there aren't large crowds of people and it is dark....
2016-02-25 12:55:26	JacolynDandreano	then id probably start thinking of what i would need to do if you started walking towards me
2016-02-25 12:55:42	JacolynDandreano	id certainly run closer to the opposite side of the sidewalk
2016-02-25 12:55:43	yama	rude
2016-02-25 12:55:57	JacolynDandreano	I'm talking about strangers
2016-02-25 12:56:02	JacolynDandreano	i think it is smart
2016-02-25 12:56:04	JacolynDandreano	not rude
2016-02-25 12:56:06	yama	i didnt know i looked rough :(
2016-02-25 12:56:32	JacolynDandreano	i don't think you do but thats b/c i know you
2016-02-25 12:56:33	JacolynDandreano	:)
2016-02-25 12:56:38	yama	haha
2016-02-25 12:56:43	yama	so if u didnt u would
2016-02-25 12:57:15	yama	so maybe i was right that woman started taking another route to avoid me
2016-02-25 12:58:41	JacolynDandreano	im not saying that
2016-02-25 12:58:44	JacolynDandreano	i dont know
2016-02-25 12:58:52	JacolynDandreano	but u do have beard so you must be a terrorist

2016-02-25 15:32:46	JacolynDandreano	and you stopped talking
2016-02-25 15:32:47	JacolynDandreano	:)
2016-02-25 15:45:10	JacolynDandreano	are you going to answer
2016-02-25 15:52:31	yama	sry i went to get coffee

2016-02-25 15:52:48	JacolynDandreano	what is your max
2016-02-25 15:52:55	yama	max what
2016-02-25 15:53:08	JacolynDandreano	faps in one day. duh
2016-02-25 15:53:22	JacolynDandreano	i think i asked you once what your average was
2016-02-25 15:53:26	JacolynDandreano	per week
2016-02-25 15:53:30	JacolynDandreano	but i don't think i asked that yet
2016-02-25 15:53:34	yama	im not telling
2016-02-25 15:53:44	JacolynDandreano	why
2016-02-25 15:53:48	JacolynDandreano	is it that much
2016-02-25 15:53:53	yama	cause u wont either
2016-02-25 15:54:00	yama	and if you do it's probably 1 or something boring
2016-02-25 15:54:13	JacolynDandreano	lol
2016-02-25 15:54:21	JacolynDandreano	ill tell. i can't help it if it is boring
2016-02-25 15:54:28	JacolynDandreano	but you should tell anyway
2016-02-25 15:54:35	yama	is it 1?
2016-02-25 15:54:51	JacolynDandreano	will you tell me
2016-02-25 15:55:38	yama	what if my answer is also boring
2016-02-25 16:00:00	JacolynDandreano	it won't be boring to me
2016-02-25 16:00:07	JacolynDandreano	only you get bored
2016-02-25 16:00:21	yama	but 1 is boring cause it's also the minimum
2016-02-25 16:00:29	yama	so it doesn't tell a story
2016-02-25 16:00:53	JacolynDandreano	so what.  i think it wouldn't be boring b/c i find it interesting learning more about people i like
2016-02-25 16:00:58	JacolynDandreano	regardless of their answers
2016-02-25 16:01:02	JacolynDandreano	just tell me
2016-02-25 16:01:27	yama	but if the answer is what you'd guess a mile away, it's not very interesting to hear it and have your guess confirmed
2016-02-25 16:01:39	JacolynDandreano	sure it is
2016-02-25 16:01:42	JacolynDandreano	now tell me
2016-02-25 16:01:52	yama	u first
2016-02-25 16:01:54	yama	ladies first
2016-02-25 16:02:04	JacolynDandreano	ill guess it is 50.  so if it is less then it will be a shock
2016-02-25 16:03:10	yama	ur bad at guessing
2016-02-25 16:03:17	JacolynDandreano	how far off was i

2016-02-28 18:27:35	yama	are you trying to find me on googlemaps
2016-02-28 18:28:10	JacolynDandreano	Because I'm not in Argentina and I have never been so I'd like to see what it is like. And you can give me firsthand evidence of a neighborhood there
2016-02-28 18:28:27	JacolynDandreano	what do you have to hide? Is it a rough neighborhood?
2016-02-28 18:28:46	JacolynDandreano	I'm not going to find your location based on a few pics
2016-02-28 18:29:49	yama	no i just don't want to go out lol
2016-02-28 18:30:04	yama	maybe i'll take a few quick pics when i go to work
2016-02-28 18:30:16	JacolynDandreano	They had better be enough
2016-02-28 18:30:22	yama	2
2016-02-28 18:30:23	yama	maybe 3
2016-02-28 18:30:27	JacolynDandreano	but u keep always pushing it back another day
2016-02-28 18:30:36	JacolynDandreano	i want like 10-15 and I want it now
2016-02-28 18:30:44	yama	it just looks like a neighborhood
2016-02-28 18:30:47	JacolynDandreano	from different vantage points
2016-02-28 18:31:00	yama	what will u give in return
2016-02-28 18:31:16	JacolynDandreano	no, neighborhoods and architecture and landscapes do not look the same in every part of the world
2016-02-28 18:31:30	JacolynDandreano	don't try to tell me that ar looks like ny
2016-02-28 18:31:37	yama	but it's not representative of .ar
2016-02-28 18:31:50	yama	downtown looks like a smaller nyc
2016-02-28 18:31:58	JacolynDandreano	it is representative of a part of ar
2016-02-28 18:32:09	JacolynDandreano	I want to see the part where you actually live
2016-02-28 18:32:18	JacolynDandreano	your street
2016-02-28 18:41:42	yama	there's nothing special about it tho
2016-02-28 19:42:13	JacolynDandreano	It isn't about that
2016-02-28 19:42:23	JacolynDandreano	i like to visualize. Give me the pics
2016-02-28 19:42:34	yama	it's starting to get dark now
2016-02-28 19:42:48	yama	and i'm scared i'll find scary tall men in dark alleys
2016-02-28 19:42:51	yama	:)
2016-02-28 19:46:02	JacolynDandreano	Don't be scared of your feelings for them
2016-02-28 19:46:08	JacolynDandreano	also you're an ass :P
2016-02-28 19:47:04	yama	maybe i should say I don't want to be the scary tall man that makes a girl feel scared
2016-02-28 19:47:57	JacolynDandreano	Haha
2016-02-28 19:48:27	JacolynDandreano	just don't have shifty eyes and stare incessantly and you'll be fine
2016-02-28 20:11:00	yama	I'm just too good at coming up with excuses not to go out
2016-02-28 20:11:07	yama	are you gonna watch the oscars
2016-02-28 20:12:34	JacolynDandreano	No, your excuses suck :P
2016-02-28 20:13:09	JacolynDandreano	i didn't know the oscars were on. I probably won't watch them. My sister is coming over to hangout. We may just read or watch a movie or something
2016-02-28 20:13:34	JacolynDandreano	are you going to watch them
2016-02-28 20:13:45	yama	maybe
2016-02-28 20:14:06	yama	if the film irc is talking about it
2016-02-28 20:18:19	JacolynDandreano	Meh

2016-02-28 21:02:07	JacolynDandreano	My sister is supposed to get here soon. I thought she was going to stay for a while but now it looks like she may just make a quick stop here on her way to the store.
2016-02-28 21:03:33	yama	is she meeting the guy
2016-02-28 21:03:46	yama	or is it not that sister
2016-02-28 21:05:36	JacolynDandreano	Nah this is a different one
2016-02-28 21:05:57	JacolynDandreano	she doesn't have much time to spend with me but also "is feeling lonely"
2016-02-28 21:06:21	JacolynDandreano	I was hoping she would be here for a good hour or two
2016-02-28 21:06:26	yama	is she single?
2016-02-28 21:06:35	yama	and why is the store more important than u, that's rude
2016-02-28 21:06:35	JacolynDandreano	yeah
2016-02-28 21:06:40	JacolynDandreano	lol
2016-02-28 21:06:47	JacolynDandreano	she prob has homework or planning to do

2016-02-28 22:50:48	--	[JacolynDandreano] is away: Offline
2016-02-28 22:51:07	yama	well at least she stayed :)
2016-02-28 22:51:48	JacolynDandreano	Yep
2016-02-28 22:51:50	JacolynDandreano	:)
2016-02-28 22:52:01	JacolynDandreano	I also tried hs for the first time in months
2016-02-28 22:52:01	JacolynDandreano	I also tried hs for the first time in months
2016-02-28 22:52:01	JacolynDandreano	I also tried hs for the first time in months
2016-02-28 22:52:01	JacolynDandreano	I also tried hs for the first time in months
2016-02-28 22:52:15	yama	and?
2016-02-28 22:52:25	yama	i wish i could :(
2016-02-28 22:52:38	yama	I'm assuming your shoulder is better
2016-02-28 22:52:45	JacolynDandreano	And it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be
2016-02-28 22:53:14	JacolynDandreano	but I don't think hollow body felt comfortable
2016-02-28 22:53:14	yama	did you record
2016-02-28 22:53:20	JacolynDandreano	so I don't think I will do it again
2016-02-28 22:53:23	JacolynDandreano	nah
2016-02-28 22:53:30	yama	record for me
2016-02-28 22:53:32	JacolynDandreano	I was showing her what was wrong with hers lol
2016-02-28 22:53:41	yama	ohh
2016-02-28 22:53:46	yama	snobbing her
2016-02-28 22:53:47	yama	im proud
2016-02-28 22:53:54	JacolynDandreano	Lol
2016-02-28 22:54:17	JacolynDandreano	i also told her why I think she can't get the transition for muscle ups down
2016-02-28 22:54:40	yama	because it's hard
2016-02-28 22:54:55	JacolynDandreano	and we discussed assisted tuck planche practice too
2016-02-28 22:55:01	JacolynDandreano	because she wants planche
2016-02-28 22:55:16	JacolynDandreano	i think her dips aren't deep enough
2016-02-28 22:55:30	yama	how many ring dips can she do
2016-02-28 22:56:05	JacolynDandreano	she has explosive chest to bar pull-ups but can't dip from that level as I pointed out, so she either needs to dip deeper or pull higher than her chest
2016-02-28 22:56:11	JacolynDandreano	she doesn't have rings at all
2016-02-28 22:56:20	JacolynDandreano	just goes to planet fitness like me
2016-02-28 22:56:29	yama	bar mu are harder afaik
2016-02-28 22:56:57	JacolynDandreano	Yeah. Because she also can't practice one-bar rows
2016-02-28 22:57:04	JacolynDandreano	ooops
2016-02-28 22:57:09	JacolynDandreano	dips not rows lol
2016-02-28 22:57:16	yama	and even with the deepest dips and the chest to bar pullups, i don't think the transition is covered 
2016-02-28 22:57:46	JacolynDandreano	yeah well she is practicing transition with false grip on a slight assistance
2016-02-28 22:58:02	JacolynDandreano	but I think her dips aren't deep enough
2016-02-28 22:58:15	JacolynDandreano	anyway she will get it soon
2016-02-28 22:58:21	JacolynDandreano	her hs sucks tho
2016-02-28 22:58:27	yama	lol
2016-02-28 22:58:32	JacolynDandreano	she has horrible shoulder mobility
2016-02-28 22:58:52	JacolynDandreano	she can't even do dislocates on my broomstick
2016-02-28 22:59:07	JacolynDandreano	so I told her to add those in every day to her warmups
2016-02-28 22:59:16	yama	i can't either
2016-02-28 22:59:39	yama	well i haven't tried in a while
2016-02-28 22:59:48	JacolynDandreano	she actually told me that she bends her body to balance, rather than flexing hands
2016-02-28 23:00:00	JacolynDandreano	so she is arched
2016-02-28 23:00:14	JacolynDandreano	I bet yours are better than hers
2016-02-28 23:00:21	yama	my hs or my dislocate?
2016-02-28 23:00:30	JacolynDandreano	both lol
2016-02-28 23:00:40	JacolynDandreano	your hs is def better tho
2016-02-28 23:01:15	JacolynDandreano	ive given up on being good at anything I wished for. Now I won't be jelly if she gets all these cool skills
2016-02-28 23:01:17	yama	ty
2016-02-28 23:01:35	yama	how can she be arched if she's doing ctw tho
2016-02-28 23:01:41	yama	and why is she not doing cw if she's arches
2016-02-28 23:01:53	JacolynDandreano	because dumb
2016-02-28 23:02:04	JacolynDandreano	she doesn't care about her line as much as I do
2016-02-28 23:02:31	JacolynDandreano	she doesn't understand that it is important to go back to wall. She just wants that longer freestanding
2016-02-28 23:03:01	JacolynDandreano	i also think she arches to compensate for her shoulders
2016-02-28 23:03:14	JacolynDandreano	it must affect that
2016-02-28 23:03:40	yama	ye
2016-02-28 23:05:18	yama	well then she'll probably never have a better hs than u :)
2016-02-28 23:05:25	yama	so u can be snob about that 4ever
2016-02-28 23:06:10	JacolynDandreano	Haha until mine gets to be worse than hers
2016-02-28 23:06:31	yama	record yours
2016-02-28 23:06:47	JacolynDandreano	also I can only barely get hands flat in a cold standing pike now
2016-02-28 23:07:00	yama	oh no so bad
2016-02-28 23:07:19	JacolynDandreano	yeah I felt really sad
2016-02-28 23:07:21	JacolynDandreano	:/
2016-02-28 23:07:28	yama	that's why i don't like flexibility
2016-02-28 23:07:42	yama	all those h2t where you felt like dying and puking
2016-02-28 23:07:52	JacolynDandreano	I am not doing hs anymore unless my doc says it is ok.  The hollow body felt weird
2016-02-28 23:08:04	JacolynDandreano	yeah h2t is ruined
2016-02-28 23:08:05	yama	weird how
2016-02-28 23:08:08	JacolynDandreano	:'(
2016-02-28 23:08:20	JacolynDandreano	just weird
2016-02-28 23:08:23	yama	how
2016-02-28 23:08:24	yama	were
2016-02-28 23:08:31	yama	i mean hollow is mostly core
2016-02-28 23:08:35	yama	so why was it weird
2016-02-28 23:08:37	JacolynDandreano	idk. It made my stomach hurt a bit
2016-02-28 23:08:47	yama	oh
2016-02-28 23:09:17	JacolynDandreano	maybe I'm just not used to doing hollow body since it has been a long time
2016-02-28 23:09:41	JacolynDandreano	but I have a doc appointment a week from tomorrow so I'm going to ask details about what I can and cannot do in workouts
2016-02-28 23:09:57	JacolynDandreano	I already know that hollow body on the ground is out
2016-02-28 23:10:17	yama	:(
2016-02-28 23:10:17	JacolynDandreano	and goblet squats are out too
2016-02-28 23:10:42	JacolynDandreano	But I think push-ups and rows and stepups should be fine
2016-02-28 23:10:50	JacolynDandreano	and probably cable kick backs
2016-02-28 23:10:56	JacolynDandreano	and I think planks are ok
2016-02-28 23:11:33	yama	so your shoulder is healed?
2016-02-28 23:12:34	JacolynDandreano	I am not sure
2016-02-28 23:12:44	JacolynDandreano	but it hasn't caused me any pain in a long time
2016-02-28 23:12:56	JacolynDandreano	sonce I stopped using it
2016-02-28 23:13:02	yama	my wrist still hurts
2016-02-28 23:14:36	JacolynDandreano	No! :( that sucks. I hope you haven't been using it
2016-02-28 23:14:51	yama	did u even remember it was hurting
2016-02-28 23:14:53	yama	:p
2016-02-28 23:15:57	JacolynDandreano	Yes. Of course. Because you said you were taking a deload week
2016-02-28 23:16:13	JacolynDandreano	but I assumed it would go away after a day or two
2016-02-28 23:16:24	JacolynDandreano	Since you caught it early I thought
2016-02-28 23:18:21	yama	it hurt moving it in certain positions, I did some of the wrist warmup and it hurt worringly, but right after it stopped hurting as much as before when not putting pressure
2016-02-28 23:22:03	JacolynDandreano	Oh. Well maybe you should take another week off?
2016-02-28 23:22:34	yama	im not gonna do any pushing
2016-02-28 23:22:40	yama	until it goes away completely
2016-02-28 23:23:00	yama	or until i get my paralettes
2016-02-28 23:24:10	yama	if it lasts long I'm going to be so pissed and bummed
2016-02-28 23:24:16	yama	and probably reevaluate thigns
2016-02-28 23:25:05	JacolynDandreano	I reevaluated my life after my injury lol
2016-02-28 23:25:14	JacolynDandreano	I hope it heals quickly
2016-02-28 23:25:48	yama	but yours came after you got a new move and did it a few times

2016-03-01 11:25:16	yama	i had 3 dreams in a row that i remembered, which is very unusual
2016-03-01 11:29:53	JacolynDandreano	what were they about
2016-03-01 11:30:14	yama	the first was too videogamey to explain
2016-03-01 11:30:23	yama	the second was the LD, but it was weird
2016-03-01 11:30:28	yama	I was basically like Killgrave
2016-03-01 11:30:40	JacolynDandreano	lol scary!
2016-03-01 11:30:56	yama	I sort of knew I was in a dream but for some reason I couldn't do anything that defied physics and whatnot
2016-03-01 11:30:56	JacolynDandreano	you were controlling people? or just being overall mean and rude
2016-03-01 11:31:16	yama	I just controlled people
2016-03-01 11:31:48	yama	I walked into a hotel and put on a confident face and stance and told the desk girl to give me the best room in the hotel

2016-03-01 11:32:40	yama	hahah
2016-03-01 11:32:52	yama	if you were the desk girl in my dream that's not all I would have asked
2016-03-01 11:33:00	JacolynDandreano	lol

2016-03-01 11:44:52	yama	dunno I still don't think it's appropriate
2016-03-01 11:46:26	JacolynDandreano	if you are friendly in small ways beyond just "what can i sell you" then small talk could lead to something more
2016-03-01 11:46:26	JacolynDandreano	if you are friendly in small ways beyond just "what can i sell you" then small talk could lead to something more
2016-03-01 11:46:26	JacolynDandreano	if you are friendly in small ways beyond just "what can i sell you" then small talk could lead to something more

2016-03-01 14:58:46	JacolynDandreano	i do! i just don't want to answer that particular question b/c it seems so implausible
2016-03-01 14:58:48	JacolynDandreano	and absurd
2016-03-01 14:59:43	yama	how is it more implausible than having a millionaire dream house
2016-03-01 15:00:18	JacolynDandreano	that's possible tho
2016-03-01 15:00:29	JacolynDandreano	i won't do a 3 some ever
2016-03-01 15:00:37	JacolynDandreano	it is way less possible than becoming a millionaire
2016-03-01 15:00:39	yama	so you'd rather die?
2016-03-01 15:01:33	JacolynDandreano	haha
2016-03-01 15:01:39	JacolynDandreano	yes id probably die before doing that
2016-03-01 15:01:46	JacolynDandreano	which would you choose
2016-03-01 15:01:48	yama	wtf
2016-03-01 15:01:53	yama	you're so weird today
2016-03-01 15:02:00	yama	no im not answering more questions form u -.-
2016-03-01 15:02:04	JacolynDandreano	th-thanks
2016-03-01 15:02:12	JacolynDandreano	why? I've answered questions from you for days
2016-03-01 15:02:22	JacolynDandreano	I'm sorry you didn't like the answer to your question
2016-03-01 15:02:33	JacolynDandreano	I'm sorry it isn't cool enough for you
2016-03-01 15:02:34	yama	because it's a much simpler question than many i've asked
2016-03-01 15:02:45	JacolynDandreano	but more implausible
2016-03-01 15:02:50	JacolynDandreano	but fine ill answer
2016-03-01 15:02:50	yama	and because it's obviously a lie that you'd choose to die rather than to have sex once with 2 people
2016-03-01 15:02:56	JacolynDandreano	the answer should be obvious to you
2016-03-01 15:03:00	JacolynDandreano	id clearly choose two men
2016-03-01 15:03:03	yama	i once asked about flight vs invisibility
2016-03-01 15:03:06	JacolynDandreano	i like dicks
2016-03-01 15:03:06	JacolynDandreano	i like dicks
2016-03-01 15:03:09	yama	lol
2016-03-01 15:03:13	yama	was that so hard
2016-03-01 15:03:18	JacolynDandreano	no homo
2016-03-01 15:03:26	JacolynDandreano	i don't know why you even doubted
2016-03-01 15:03:44	yama	because you think that's gay apparently
2016-03-01 15:04:06	JacolynDandreano	yeah well i wouldn't find it attractive that a guy would want to be around with another guy
2016-03-01 15:04:18	JacolynDandreano	im not even slightly attracted to gay dicks.
2016-03-01 15:04:23	JacolynDandreano	not even 1%
2016-03-01 15:06:05	yama	the dick looks the same
2016-03-01 15:07:22	JacolynDandreano	well i guess i enjoy sex when it is more of a connection to the person instead of a random hookup.
2016-03-01 15:07:59	yama	i didn't say it was a random hookup tho
2016-03-01 15:08:32	JacolynDandreano	im a jelly person.  so i find it attractive if the person is into me. not into me and some other person too
2016-03-01 15:09:13	yama	like 4 months ago you said you're not a jealous person :p
2016-03-01 15:09:18	yama	also both people can be into you
2016-03-01 15:09:26	yama	literally 
2016-03-01 15:10:21	JacolynDandreano	haha
2016-03-01 15:10:35	JacolynDandreano	im not jealous in general.
2016-03-01 15:10:58	JacolynDandreano	but I'm jelly when it comes to someone i like not being into me more than anyone else
2016-03-01 15:14:58	yama	i think u just lied to me that time
2016-03-01 15:15:44	JacolynDandreano	no i answered as honestly as i could
2016-03-01 15:16:35	yama	i think i asked about me, so maybe u didnt like me at the time so you wouldn't get jealous if i talked to someone else or something
2016-03-01 15:17:39	JacolynDandreano	i don't get jealous if people talk to someone else
2016-03-01 15:17:44	JacolynDandreano	i never disliked you
2016-03-01 15:21:26	yama	liked me less maybe
2016-03-01 15:21:42	yama	but u did say you'd get jealous if i talked to another girl from irc more than you
2016-03-01 15:21:50	yama	maybe you changed your mind again
2016-03-01 15:21:56	JacolynDandreano	yes but thats different
2016-03-01 15:22:06	JacolynDandreano	i wouldn't be jelly if you talked to a girl
2016-03-01 15:22:14	JacolynDandreano	i would be jelly if you talked to a girl more than me
2016-03-01 15:22:23	JacolynDandreano	that reminds me.... do you yet? lol
2016-03-01 15:22:32	yama	no?

2016-03-01 15:22:51	JacolynDandreano	:) maybe you just don't want me to be jealous

2016-03-01 15:23:12	yama	i do want you to be jealous :)
2016-03-01 15:23:22	JacolynDandreano	:( why
2016-03-01 15:23:26	JacolynDandreano	i don't like feeling jealous
2016-03-01 15:23:31	yama	 cause i'd feel speshul
2016-03-01 15:23:36	JacolynDandreano	it just makes me want to be around the person less tho
2016-03-01 15:23:40	JacolynDandreano	id just back off
2016-03-01 15:23:46	JacolynDandreano	and let you have your other friends

2016-03-01 15:23:46	JacolynDandreano	and let you have your other friends
2016-03-01 15:24:16	yama	so if i get a gf, it is you who will talk less to me
2016-03-01 15:26:13	JacolynDandreano	if you get a gf and stop talking as much then i will stop talking as much too
2016-03-01 15:26:16	JacolynDandreano	seems p normal
2016-03-01 15:50:16	yama	no but if i talk to her more
2016-03-01 15:51:39	JacolynDandreano	lol im not crazy. i wouldn't expect you to talk to me more than you talk to a gf
2016-03-01 15:51:55	yama	but would you "back off"
2016-03-01 15:52:56	JacolynDandreano	hmm i think i would if you started talking to me less.  it is what i naturally do as a semi-insecure, introverted person
2016-03-01 15:53:12	JacolynDandreano	at first i might demand you talk to me if you're being quiet lol
2016-03-01 15:53:23	yama	no, im saying if i talk the same to u
2016-03-01 15:53:25	JacolynDandreano	but if you made a habit of being less talkative i think i would take the hint and back off
2016-03-01 15:53:33	yama	but more to a gf
2016-03-01 15:53:36	JacolynDandreano	oh. then i would talk to you normally

2016-03-01 19:07:20	yama	Vox » Women in general are often expected to be performative, both sexually and physically. This means that they're expected to prepare their appearance in various ways in order to a) be sexually appealing, b) be socially conforming, and c) to compare them to other women
2016-03-01 19:07:24	JacolynDandreano	especially for someone who can't even buy beer yet
2016-03-01 19:07:27	yama	that's the first part, i think she's typing more

2016-03-04 18:13:09	yama	how, through bitlbee
2016-03-04 18:13:29	yama	why, because i like having all chats in one place, don't like depending on the browser, it's more comfortable, faster, prettier
2016-03-04 18:22:31	JacolynDandreano	I don't get it but ok
2016-03-04 18:24:17	yama	y don u get it
2016-03-04 18:24:19	yama	it's simple!
2016-03-04 18:24:49	yama	i can switch between conversations in irc, here and slack with just one keyboard shortcut
2016-03-04 18:25:16	JacolynDandreano	What is slack
2016-03-04 18:25:33	yama	a chat service
2016-03-04 18:25:36	yama	similar to irc
2016-03-04 18:25:42	yama	i talk to my friends there
2016-03-04 18:25:46	yama	irl friends
2016-03-04 18:25:49	yama	all 2 of them
2016-03-04 18:26:04	JacolynDandreano	they are all on a group there
2016-03-04 18:26:15	JacolynDandreano	why don't u just text tho
2016-03-04 18:26:36	yama	why would i use a message system that costs money
2016-03-04 18:27:17	yama	and it's more akward to use on computer
2016-03-04 18:27:59	JacolynDandreano	oh well here the phone service provides texts with the monthly plan
2016-03-04 18:28:14	JacolynDandreano	so u use that on the comp too
2016-03-04 18:30:09	yama	monthly plan is free?
2016-03-04 18:31:27	JacolynDandreano	No? But it would prob be similar with or without texts
2016-03-04 18:31:45	yama	i dont have a monthly plan
2016-03-04 18:32:48	yama	i don't use my cellphone as a phone
2016-03-04 18:33:07	yama	i'd love a really cheap plan with only 3g and pay for call that i make only, but that doesn't exist
2016-03-04 18:34:03	JacolynDandreano	Wait
2016-03-04 18:34:13	JacolynDandreano	so you can have Internet without an actual plan

2016-03-04 18:34:26	JacolynDandreano	wat
2016-03-04 18:34:34	yama	that's why i dont talk to you during train rides
2016-03-04 18:34:41	yama	i just connect to wifi
2016-03-04 18:34:50	yama	like my home's wifi or my work's neighbor's
2016-03-04 18:34:53	JacolynDandreano	well u should get a plan so that u can talk on train rides
2016-03-04 18:35:05	JacolynDandreano	jk that would be expensive as hell
2016-03-04 18:35:06	yama	no i dont want monthly expenses
2016-03-04 18:35:30	yama	those plans come with calls and shit, even if you don't use them you pay for like $25
2016-03-04 18:36:38	JacolynDandreano	Oh
2016-03-04 18:37:52	yama	i should research that a bit
2016-03-04 18:37:58	yama	cause rn i can't even receive calls

2016-03-07 11:38:27	JacolynDandreano	it was this big lake and there were people on the sandy part during the day, and i think maybe we walked around and explored b/c it was pretty.  and then at night we were on this huge rock with a smooth flat top that kinda jutted out much higher than the beach.  and we were just lying down on it all night
2016-03-07 11:38:31	JacolynDandreano	i think thats it
2016-03-07 11:38:38	JacolynDandreano	as far as i remember

2016-03-07 20:03:21	JacolynDandreano	Except when I eat things like tacos or burgers
2016-03-07 20:03:46	JacolynDandreano	Then I just let it drip on my hands and then I lick it. Is that gross?  I feel like it is gross lol
2016-03-07 20:03:59	JacolynDandreano	I don't do it at restaurants
2016-03-07 20:04:03	JacolynDandreano	just at home
2016-03-07 20:04:07	yama	and the filling will be really hot, almost to the point that it burns you but not quite, and you will be too ditracted by the taste to realize the juice is running down into your cleavage ;)
2016-03-07 20:04:18	yama	no it's not gross
2016-03-07 20:04:33	yama	if you didn't lick your fingers i'd think you didn't like my empanadas enough
2016-03-07 20:06:29	JacolynDandreano	:O
2016-03-07 20:07:07	yama	do you like them hot, or just warm enough?

2016-03-07 20:11:35	JacolynDandreano	oh same
2016-03-07 20:11:40	yama	it might be that i've conditioned myself to like them that hot
2016-03-07 20:11:46	yama	because i'm in a hurry to eat them
2016-03-07 20:11:58	yama	and i eat them as soon as i can do it without burning my tongue
2016-03-07 20:12:06	yama	sometimes i take a small bite and blow 
2016-03-07 20:12:07	yama	no homo
2016-03-07 20:12:14	JacolynDandreano	well I like food that is supposed to be warm to be hot but I usually burn myself on the first two bites

2016-03-07 20:14:21	JacolynDandreano	like a fattie
2016-03-07 20:15:47	JacolynDandreano	once when I was a teen I ate a giant spoonful of hot mashed potatoes. It was so hot that it burned my esophagus and wasn't going down to my stomach. I could not eat anything for the next two days without a lot of pain
2016-03-07 20:34:33	yama	wow
2016-03-07 20:45:48	yama	that sounds like something a doge would do

2016-03-07 23:26:19	yama	no wonder u were so quiet

2016-03-07 23:39:57	yama	yes
2016-03-07 23:40:03	JacolynDandreano	she was going to make baked but ran out of time
2016-03-07 23:40:06	yama	but i never make them
2016-03-07 23:40:12	yama	cause fuckload of oil
2016-03-07 23:40:13	yama	to use
2016-03-07 23:40:18	yama	and fuckload of calories
2016-03-07 23:40:20	JacolynDandreano	anyway I don't know why I should care about calories.
2016-03-07 23:40:36	JacolynDandreano	I'm fat because I haven't worked out. Not because I'm eating enough
2016-03-07 23:40:48	yama	you're not fat
2016-03-07 23:40:59	JacolynDandreano	when I start eating enough I'll start worrying about calories
2016-03-07 23:41:05	JacolynDandreano	thanks but u don't know
2016-03-07 23:41:14	JacolynDandreano	my arms and legs are fat
2016-03-07 23:41:21	yama	but what u said doesn't make sense
2016-03-07 23:41:30	JacolynDandreano	it does make sense
2016-03-07 23:41:44	yama	you know it's about calories in vs calories out
2016-03-07 23:41:49	JacolynDandreano	my body converted all my previously-gained muscles into fat
2016-03-07 23:41:55	yama	wat
2016-03-07 23:41:59	JacolynDandreano	yes
2016-03-07 23:42:01	yama	that doesn't happen lol
2016-03-07 23:42:07	JacolynDandreano	no more muscle on my arms or legs
2016-03-07 23:42:19	yama	that's not how it works!
2016-03-07 23:42:26	JacolynDandreano	well it is what happened
2016-03-07 23:42:29	yama	no
2016-03-07 23:42:41	JacolynDandreano	because i haven't been getting even maintenance calories most days
2016-03-07 23:42:51	yama	then you haven't gained fat
2016-03-07 23:42:55	JacolynDandreano	so how else could I have gotten even fatter
2016-03-07 23:43:00	JacolynDandreano	no but I did
2016-03-07 23:43:11	yama	it is impossible to eat below maintenance and gain fat
2016-03-07 23:43:17	yama	you know this 
2016-03-07 23:43:34	JacolynDandreano	if u lose your muscle it doesn't just *poof* make you small
2016-03-07 23:43:39	JacolynDandreano	it makes you fat
2016-03-07 23:43:56	yama	wut?
2016-03-07 23:44:00	JacolynDandreano	my arms are not as hard
2016-03-07 23:44:04	yama	if you have 20% bf
2016-03-07 23:44:05	JacolynDandreano	as they were
2016-03-07 23:44:08	yama	and you lose lean mass
2016-03-07 23:44:19	yama	the amount of fat you have will be the same
2016-03-07 23:44:30	JacolynDandreano	and my legs are not as hard as they were
2016-03-07 23:44:30	JacolynDandreano	and my legs are not as hard as they were
2016-03-07 23:44:30	JacolynDandreano	and my legs are not as hard as they were
2016-03-07 23:44:31	JacolynDandreano	and my legs are not as hard as they were
2016-03-07 23:44:41	JacolynDandreano	they are softer
2016-03-07 23:45:33	yama	maybe you feel you're fatter or you feel that you look fatter (not FAT, just fatTER), but if you're not eating enough you can't gain fat storages
2016-03-07 23:46:00	JacolynDandreano	anyway. I can't wait to go to the doctor so that I can find out what damn exercises I can do so that I don't feel so soft
2016-03-07 23:46:00	JacolynDandreano	anyway. I can't wait to go to the doctor so that I can find out what damn exercises I can do so that I don't feel so soft
2016-03-07 23:46:00	JacolynDandreano	anyway. I can't wait to go to the doctor so that I can find out what damn exercises I can do so that I don't feel so soft
2016-03-07 23:46:00	JacolynDandreano	anyway. I can't wait to go to the doctor so that I can find out what damn exercises I can do so that I don't feel so soft
2016-03-07 23:46:10	JacolynDandreano	well maybe I'm eating a ton without realizing then

2016-03-08 16:09:58	JacolynDandreano	are you not?
2016-03-08 16:11:25	yama	i read "hot"
2016-03-08 16:11:30	yama	im warming up
2016-03-08 16:12:25	JacolynDandreano	i wouldn't ask you if you were hot
2016-03-08 16:12:32	JacolynDandreano	i already know you are blind
2016-03-08 16:13:02	yama	i am without the glasses

2016-03-08 16:18:28	yama	nah more like 10/10
2016-03-08 16:18:33	yama	cause u always rate 10
2016-03-08 16:18:38	yama	cause you need glasses
2016-03-08 16:18:39	yama	got em
2016-03-08 16:19:55	JacolynDandreano	i don't always rate 10
2016-03-08 16:19:58	JacolynDandreano	thats absurd
2016-03-08 16:20:01	JacolynDandreano	i rarely rate 10
2016-03-08 16:22:42	yama	u do
2016-03-08 16:22:46	yama	for people u talk to 
2016-03-08 16:22:54	yama	cause you're too wuss to give honest rating :)
2016-03-08 16:23:20	JacolynDandreano	no
2016-03-08 16:23:32	JacolynDandreano	b/c my rating is biased once i meet them
2016-03-08 16:23:39	JacolynDandreano	it changes based on their personalitty
2016-03-08 16:24:32	yama	but you're rating appearance
2016-03-08 16:24:48	yama	by that logic, every single person is a potential 10 simply by you getting to know them
2016-03-08 16:24:51	yama	your system is dumb
2016-03-08 16:25:20	JacolynDandreano	thats my point
2016-03-08 16:25:26	yama	oh good
2016-03-08 16:25:30	yama	you agree with me that it's dumb
2016-03-08 16:25:33	yama	and irrelevant
2016-03-08 16:25:34	yama	:)
2016-03-08 16:25:35	JacolynDandreano	their appearance changes in my mind once i get to know them
2016-03-08 16:25:39	JacolynDandreano	it isn't dumb
2016-03-08 16:25:41	JacolynDandreano	it is natural
2016-03-08 16:25:50	JacolynDandreano	i bet the same thing happens to you
2016-03-08 16:25:51	yama	no
2016-03-08 16:25:56	yama	of course not
2016-03-08 16:26:00	JacolynDandreano	i bet you feel differently about the girls on irc
2016-03-08 16:26:04	JacolynDandreano	once you met them
2016-03-08 16:26:11	yama	maybe but not automatically a 10
2016-03-08 16:26:18	yama	that's just a copout
2016-03-08 16:26:25	JacolynDandreano	it isn't a copout
2016-03-08 16:26:30	yama	ye
2016-03-08 16:26:31	JacolynDandreano	people i like get a 10
2016-03-08 16:26:37	JacolynDandreano	stop hating on my scale
2016-03-08 16:26:39	yama	makes it irrelevant :)
2016-03-08 16:26:55	yama	it means i get the same score as srraven
2016-03-08 16:27:00	yama	i can't accept that
2016-03-08 16:28:31	JacolynDandreano	no
2016-03-08 16:28:38	JacolynDandreano	well maybe it does
2016-03-08 16:28:43	JacolynDandreano	but i gave you higher than a 10
2016-03-08 16:28:46	JacolynDandreano	so stop complaining
2016-03-08 16:28:57	yama	but i dont know everyone else's
2016-03-08 16:29:02	yama	i bet im not the only over 10
2016-03-08 16:32:31	JacolynDandreano	stop comparing yourself to other people
2016-03-08 16:32:41	JacolynDandreano	thats never healthy
2016-03-08 16:33:04	yama	im not, just to ratings in your mind :)
2016-03-08 16:33:47	JacolynDandreano	I'm rolling my eyes at you
2016-03-08 16:34:22	yama	prove it

2016-03-08 16:45:09	JacolynDandreano	in comparison to my face
2016-03-08 16:45:15	JacolynDandreano	and also closer to the screen
2016-03-08 16:45:23	JacolynDandreano	so there is probably a glare
2016-03-08 16:45:34	yama	ye it's probably the cheeks

2016-03-08 16:53:12	yama	i didn't say i was gonna be rough
2016-03-08 16:53:56	JacolynDandreano	isn't rough the opposite of gentle
2016-03-08 16:54:16	yama	yes, but it's like u assumed i'd be rough
2016-03-08 16:54:18	JacolynDandreano	or did you mean you wouldn't bite them at all

2016-03-10 12:02:31	JacolynDandreano	but i don't feel like buying it
2016-03-10 12:02:32	JacolynDandreano	:/
2016-03-10 12:04:27	yama	piece?
2016-03-10 12:04:39	yama	yes to walk him
2016-03-10 12:04:49	JacolynDandreano	yes
2016-03-10 12:04:59	JacolynDandreano	i need to buy the usb receiver separately
2016-03-10 12:05:03	JacolynDandreano	i doubt my brother has it
2016-03-10 12:05:05	yama	oh
2016-03-10 12:05:07	JacolynDandreano	tho i guess i could ask
2016-03-10 12:05:11	yama	how come?
2016-03-10 12:05:19	JacolynDandreano	wish i had known before i did all that shit
2016-03-10 12:05:21	yama	the cable doesn't work?
2016-03-10 12:05:31	JacolynDandreano	nah it needs the receiver
2016-03-10 12:05:34	yama	does he have any wired gamepads?
2016-03-10 12:05:36	JacolynDandreano	otherwise it won't read it i guess
2016-03-10 12:05:37	yama	non-wireless?
2016-03-10 12:05:42	yama	that is odd
2016-03-10 12:05:48	JacolynDandreano	i don't know what wireless gamepads means
2016-03-10 12:05:52	yama	is it still blinking?
2016-03-10 12:05:59	JacolynDandreano	i took it out and put it away
2016-03-10 12:06:00	yama	you don't know what wireless means?
2016-03-10 12:06:05	JacolynDandreano	i think it works wireless
2016-03-10 12:06:12	JacolynDandreano	but i think you still need the receiver either way
2016-03-10 12:06:14	JacolynDandreano	to connect it
2016-03-10 12:06:24	JacolynDandreano	i don't know what a gamepad is
2016-03-10 12:06:34	yama	the controller
2016-03-10 12:07:10	yama	wireless controllers should work when they're connected via the wire too
2016-03-10 12:07:13	yama	i'll ask a friend
2016-03-10 12:07:32	JacolynDandreano	i think this controller works without the wire
2016-03-10 12:07:42	JacolynDandreano	b/c i unplugged it and it was still able to light up
2016-03-10 12:07:50	JacolynDandreano	but i need the usb receiver either way
2016-03-10 12:07:52	yama	yes
2016-03-10 12:08:10	yama	and yeah apparently 360 wireless controllers don't work with wired
2016-03-10 12:08:31	yama	ask your brother if he has a non-wireless controller
2016-03-10 12:10:07	yama	the receiver is like $10
2016-03-10 12:10:12	yama	i would buy it for u if i could
2016-03-10 12:13:03	JacolynDandreano	lol i can buy it. i just don't feel like buying it
2016-03-10 12:13:36	JacolynDandreano	but the non-wireless controller would work without the usb receiver?
2016-03-10 12:54:03	yama	yes
2016-03-10 12:54:09	yama	because it's just wired
2016-03-10 12:54:41	JacolynDandreano	oh
2016-03-10 12:54:42	JacolynDandreano	ok
2016-03-10 12:54:53	JacolynDandreano	well supposedly i can grab a wired one tonight
2016-03-10 12:55:13	yama	good
2016-03-10 12:55:29	yama	meanwhile, why don't you set up the keyboard to play for 2mins
2016-03-10 12:55:58	JacolynDandreano	why would i want to play?
2016-03-10 12:56:04	JacolynDandreano	what difference would it make?

2016-03-10 15:13:14	JacolynDandreano	sorry
2016-03-10 15:13:22	JacolynDandreano	im in the middle of cleaning out a desk for some people
2016-03-10 15:13:27	JacolynDandreano	ill tell you in a few minutes
2016-03-10 15:35:13	JacolynDandreano	my dream was that i was coming out of my cousin's wedding and then i saw a tornado coming towards everyone, and i was scared and i wanted to run, but everyone was just watching it in awe. and then finally we ran and my SO told me to hide in an RV camper b/c there were no houses that we could go in.  and as the tornado was approaching, i was watching from inside the camper, and i saw all these little kids jumping around in
2016-03-10 15:35:13	JacolynDandreano	a bouncy house with some woman supervising them and i wanted to go save them, but i felt torn b/c i knew i was pregnant so i needed to watch out for my own kid now and b/c there wasnt any room in the camper for them to come. it was stressful
2016-03-10 15:36:50	yama	hah
2016-03-10 15:36:58	yama	i wish my dreams were that obvious
2016-03-10 15:37:15	JacolynDandreano	obvious?
2016-03-10 15:37:24	yama	yes
2016-03-10 15:37:39	JacolynDandreano	i dont understand
2016-03-10 15:38:21	yama	you're pregnant and you had a dream about the fear of protecting your future child, even at the expense of other kids
2016-03-10 15:38:31	yama	it's like right out of a hollywood movie
2016-03-10 15:46:39	JacolynDandreano	haha
2016-03-10 15:46:43	JacolynDandreano	yeah it was pretty vivid
2016-03-10 15:46:44	JacolynDandreano	the whole thing
2016-03-10 15:49:25	JacolynDandreano	i remember when we were all out of the wedding, we were just hanging out outside and i saw all these birds start to fly away.  and then this giant herd of diff animals all started running in the same direction and i started to get really worried. and i was yelling to people we needed to run and no one was listening. and then in the distance the tornado comes barreling right over the top of this mountain and everyone was
2016-03-10 15:49:25	JacolynDandreano	just standing around and i was so scared
2016-03-10 15:50:10	JacolynDandreano	and then when we finally ran, the reason why we couldn't run into a house is b/c all of the houses were built on these wood frames that basically had no basement.  so that's why i chose the RV
2016-03-10 15:50:49	JacolynDandreano	and i was in the RV with this one woman and her child. and we unzipped this fabric door and thats when i saw the kids in the bouncy house
2016-03-10 15:51:04	JacolynDandreano	i remember all the details perfectly
2016-03-10 15:52:58	yama	it's weird that your dreams are coherent
2016-03-10 15:53:10	yama	mine are so odd i can't even describe them often
2016-03-10 15:54:37	JacolynDandreano	Mine are always realistic in a sense.  like I usually don't have any weird powers or anything. and they almost always involve me trying to save people. and i can usually reason and make choices in my dreams
2016-03-10 15:54:43	JacolynDandreano	anyway what was your dream
2016-03-10 15:55:26	yama	it's not just about powers, it's the dream logic, like meanings and sensations are so detached
2016-03-10 15:55:33	yama	i just remember the last part
2016-03-10 15:56:07	yama	that it was late at night and i looked out the window and there was someone in the bushes or something
2016-03-10 15:56:17	yama	and i tried to scream
2016-03-10 15:56:28	yama	and i think i let out an 'ahh' irl
2016-03-10 15:56:30	yama	and woke up
2016-03-10 15:57:13	JacolynDandreano	Aw
2016-03-10 15:57:15	JacolynDandreano	it was me
2016-03-10 15:57:19	JacolynDandreano	i didn't mean to scare you
2016-03-10 15:57:30	JacolynDandreano	i dropped my earring and was looking for it
2016-03-10 15:57:40	yama	o

2016-03-10 18:46:45	JacolynDandreano	this lady is talking so loudly
2016-03-10 18:46:48	JacolynDandreano	jesus
2016-03-10 18:47:09	JacolynDandreano	i want to tell her she is breaking the law

2016-03-10 18:47:17	yama	u snitch
2016-03-10 18:47:27	JacolynDandreano	and not making me feel confident that she will keep my info confidential

2016-03-10 18:51:00	yama	wow i feel 3rd rate
2016-03-10 18:51:18	JacolynDandreano	My sister in law just told me she is pregnant. but the thing is, she is extremely attention-grabbing with everything she does. she talks loud, she has a bubbly personality, she plans parties for herself. I love her, but she makes everything about herself. for the past ten years I've had to share bday parties with her and she always gets all the attention
2016-03-10 18:52:27	JacolynDandreano	and i fear that she is going to steal all the attention and throw an extravagant baby shower for herself
2016-03-10 18:52:41	yama	aw
2016-03-10 18:53:06	JacolynDandreano	Yeah but I'm happy for her
2016-03-10 18:53:11	JacolynDandreano	and I don't want to be mean
2016-03-10 18:53:32	JacolynDandreano	but I'm annoyed because she gets attention ALL the time
2016-03-10 18:53:36	yama	just be louder :)
2016-03-10 18:53:41	JacolynDandreano	but I'm annoyed because she gets attention ALL the time
2016-03-10 18:53:45	JacolynDandreano	No
2016-03-10 18:53:56	JacolynDandreano	I can't be louder
2016-03-10 18:54:06	JacolynDandreano	im trying not to be bothered
2016-03-10 18:54:06	yama	carry an airhorn around
2016-03-10 18:54:12	JacolynDandreano	but she always does this
2016-03-10 18:54:16	JacolynDandreano	with everything
2016-03-10 18:54:31	yama	are you thinking she somehow knew and got pregnant on purpose to 1up you?
2016-03-10 18:54:32	JacolynDandreano	Uh that's not the type of attention I want
2016-03-10 18:54:53	yama	well i bet she gets less irc attention 
2016-03-10 18:54:59	JacolynDandreano	no, but she will 1 up me worth everything associated with it
2016-03-10 18:55:01	yama	and less online friends
2016-03-10 18:55:04	JacolynDandreano	without meaning to
2016-03-10 18:55:39	JacolynDandreano	Germán I'm the only patient here and they are making me wait. It is a 5min test
2016-03-10 18:55:48	JacolynDandreano	and the doctor is just chatting with the secretaries
2016-03-10 18:55:58	yama	sounds very normal
2016-03-10 18:56:01	JacolynDandreano	This day is so annoying
2016-03-10 18:56:52	JacolynDandreano	Tonight will be nice tho. My sister is visiting on spring break from Virginia tonight and my brother is coming up from the city

2016-03-10 19:15:46	JacolynDandreano	i thought that when I said "wrong" that I just made a dumb mistake
2016-03-10 19:15:55	JacolynDandreano	but other things are happening
2016-03-10 19:16:05	JacolynDandreano	im three minutes from home
2016-03-10 19:16:10	JacolynDandreano	I hope I don't faint
2016-03-10 19:16:21	JacolynDandreano	im nervous

2016-03-10 19:28:12	JacolynDandreano	Crackers, pistachios, and uh
2016-03-10 19:28:18	JacolynDandreano	i forget what it is called
2016-03-10 19:28:24	JacolynDandreano	i drink it all the time nkw
2016-03-10 19:28:31	JacolynDandreano	oh seltzer
2016-03-10 19:28:40	yama	why
2016-03-10 19:29:05	JacolynDandreano	why what
2016-03-10 19:29:28	yama	seltzr
2016-03-10 19:30:57	JacolynDandreano	Because it is the only thing I can sometimes drink without being aick
2016-03-10 19:41:27	yama	do you eat crackers?
2016-03-10 19:41:41	yama	i find it weird people who go shopping to buy 3 things 
2016-03-10 19:43:27	JacolynDandreano	My doctor told me that if I eat crackers before I even get out of bed in the morning, that it is supposed to help me not feel as sicj
2016-03-10 19:43:38	JacolynDandreano	are you calling me weird?
2016-03-10 19:43:46	yama	that is also weird
2016-03-10 19:43:53	JacolynDandreano	i do large shoppings about once a week
2016-03-10 19:43:59	JacolynDandreano	but I forget things
2016-03-10 19:44:03	JacolynDandreano	or things come up
2016-03-10 19:44:09	yama	it sounds so pseudo science lol
2016-03-10 19:44:12	JacolynDandreano	so then I do small shoppings in between
2016-03-10 19:44:41	yama	i see
2016-03-10 19:44:43	JacolynDandreano	well she also said that I need to eat every 1.5hrs and make sure I get protein with each snack
2016-03-10 19:45:04	yama	sounds like she lifts
2016-03-10 19:45:23	JacolynDandreano	apparently I'm feeling way sicker because I'm not eating and I get particularly sick when my sugar drops
2016-03-10 19:45:32	JacolynDandreano	and it is a vicious cycle
2016-03-10 19:45:52	JacolynDandreano	because I feel sick if I don't eat but then don't want to eat because I feel sick
2016-03-10 19:46:10	JacolynDandreano	so apparently I will feel much better if I try her suggestions
2016-03-10 19:46:17	JacolynDandreano	im gonna try it for a few days and see
2016-03-10 19:46:31	JacolynDandreano	im tired of not eating anything
2016-03-10 19:46:48	JacolynDandreano	and it got really bad today
2016-03-10 19:47:02	yama	phone your friend
2016-03-10 19:47:12	yama	and tell her you have an important request
2016-03-10 19:47:24	yama	to have her make u empanadas every day
2016-03-10 19:47:27	JacolynDandreano	Haha
2016-03-10 19:47:31	JacolynDandreano	omg I wish
2016-03-10 19:48:01	JacolynDandreano	i messed up when I was talking to u. Then I went into the eye exam and when they told me to read the test I was seeing black spots
2016-03-10 19:48:07	JacolynDandreano	and I barely read it
2016-03-10 19:48:25	JacolynDandreano	and I was really hung up on the fact that the letter F is an actual letter
2016-03-10 19:48:34	JacolynDandreano	that's when I started to feel like something was wrong
2016-03-10 19:49:12	JacolynDandreano	then I went to the store and spent five minutes looking in the wrong aisle for the seltzer even tho I get it every week and know exactly where it is
2016-03-10 19:49:52	yama	:(
2016-03-10 19:49:55	JacolynDandreano	and My body was feeling really disconnected from my brain. Like when u get really drunk
2016-03-10 19:50:00	yama	what if they tell you to wear glasses
2016-03-10 19:50:09	yama	did you eat now?
2016-03-10 19:50:11	JacolynDandreano	no she made me read a different line
2016-03-10 19:50:17	JacolynDandreano	and I guess it was ok
2016-03-10 19:50:21	JacolynDandreano	yeah I ate
2016-03-10 19:50:34	JacolynDandreano	i feel the same but it is starting to go away
2016-03-10 19:51:02	JacolynDandreano	It's not the worst it has ever been
2016-03-10 19:52:53	JacolynDandreano	What are you up to tonight?
2016-03-10 19:53:54	yama	learning programming while i watch the guy from mythbusters do a replica from a rifle from the movie barbarella

2016-03-11 23:26:31	JacolynDandreano	and I follow them off
2016-03-11 23:26:56	yama	if it's so crowded then i'd be pressed against u

2016-03-12 00:12:05	JacolynDandreano	But I'd eat YOUR pizza more than any others
2016-03-12 00:12:05	yama	im sure there's places that make neapolitan pizza
2016-03-12 00:12:11	JacolynDandreano	yeah they do
2016-03-12 00:12:28	JacolynDandreano	but most places when u order a pie it is thin crust

2016-03-12 10:32:40	JacolynDandreano	No before

2016-03-12 10:33:36	JacolynDandreano	She drapes a cape over me so none of the hair lands on me. Then there is always enough movement to knock the hair onto the floor while she cuts
2016-03-12 10:33:54	JacolynDandreano	i usually don't have stray hair afterward
2016-03-12 10:34:04	JacolynDandreano	im not getting a blow out tho. Just a cut

2016-03-12 10:35:00	yama	but i still get hair on shoulders and on my head
2016-03-12 10:35:11	JacolynDandreano	Guys seem to have more loose hairs because ur hair is shorter
2016-03-12 10:35:23	JacolynDandreano	my hair is getting cut well below my neckline
2016-03-12 10:35:29	JacolynDandreano	closer to boob line

2016-03-13 20:54:43	yama	i put sunflower seeds on the salad, it's gud
2016-03-13 20:55:28	JacolynDandreano	Nice. I used to like sunflower seeds in my salad
2016-03-13 20:55:47	yama	used to??
2016-03-13 20:56:10	JacolynDandreano	Back when I ate salads
2016-03-13 20:56:22	yama	o
2016-03-13 20:56:29	yama	well i probably wont do it often
2016-03-13 20:56:35	yama	cause seeds are caloric :(
2016-03-13 20:56:49	yama	and im having a hard time getting rid of oil on salads
2016-03-13 20:57:33	JacolynDandreano	The more healthy but tasty toppings u add to the salad, the less u need the oil for taste
2016-03-13 20:57:37	JacolynDandreano	just vinegar
2016-03-13 20:58:11	yama	but then im just replacing oil with seeds
2016-03-13 20:58:14	yama	which i guess is better
2016-03-13 20:58:16	yama	but still
2016-03-13 20:58:36	yama	i prefer lemon juice to vinegar
2016-03-13 21:00:52	JacolynDandreano	So why can't u just use the juice?
2016-03-13 21:01:32	yama	cause i like both juice and oil
2016-03-13 21:01:34	yama	and salt
2016-03-13 21:04:10	JacolynDandreano	Oh
2016-03-13 21:04:50	JacolynDandreano	I wonder if I will die from lack of exercise soon
2016-03-13 21:05:08	yama	no, you'll just become more american
2016-03-13 21:05:18	yama	you might end up voting for trump

2016-03-13 21:07:26	JacolynDandreano	tho I'm not registered democrat so I can't vote for him in the primaries
2016-03-13 21:07:35	yama	lean towards me bb
2016-03-13 21:07:39	JacolynDandreano	but I want Bernie and if not him trump
2016-03-13 21:07:44	JacolynDandreano	but I hate them both
2016-03-13 21:07:46	yama	i've no idea how that works
2016-03-13 21:07:50	JacolynDandreano	so maybe I won't vote
2016-03-13 21:07:53	yama	here you can vote whoever you want
2016-03-13 21:07:56	JacolynDandreano	how what works?
2016-03-13 21:08:04	JacolynDandreano	i can vote whoever I want to
2016-03-13 21:08:07	yama	having to register
2016-03-13 21:08:25	yama	i don't hate neither
2016-03-13 21:08:28	JacolynDandreano	oh. The parties pick the candidates that will be their official nominees
2016-03-13 21:08:34	JacolynDandreano	to go to the general election
2016-03-13 21:08:38	yama	ah ok
2016-03-13 21:09:09	JacolynDandreano	i can be a registered democrat and vote for Bernie or Hillary in the primaries and then change my mind and vote for trump in the general
2016-03-13 21:09:25	JacolynDandreano	But in primaries you can only vote with your party
2016-03-13 21:09:26	yama	i see
2016-03-13 21:09:36	JacolynDandreano	so of u haven't registered u can't pick a nominee at all
2016-03-13 21:10:46	yama	im not sure how that part works here
2016-03-13 21:10:48	JacolynDandreano	Maybe I just won't vote at all
2016-03-13 21:10:57	JacolynDandreano	u should find out
2016-03-13 21:11:06	JacolynDandreano	maybe u can get someone better to be nominated
2016-03-13 21:11:30	JacolynDandreano	here, whoever the two parties nominate has the best chance at winning
2016-03-13 21:11:30	yama	that wouldn't matter
2016-03-13 21:11:34	yama	since they won't win
2016-03-13 21:11:41	yama	and the whole 2 party system is a scam anyway
2016-03-13 21:11:51	JacolynDandreano	so even if everyone likes Bernie but Hillary gets nominated, Hillary will have the best chance
2016-03-13 21:12:10	JacolynDandreano	yeah two party system is dumb
2016-03-13 21:12:45	yama	i heard something about super delegates, that if a candidate a party doesn't want gets the people's vote, they can still put someone else
2016-03-13 21:12:52	yama	im not sure super delegate was the word
2016-03-13 21:13:15	JacolynDandreano	i have a friend who is a local councilman on the Democratic Party and he endorsed some people from the Republican Party and now the Democratic Party wants to kick him out because they only want him to endorse democrats. Which is stupid. Parties shouldn't matter
2016-03-13 21:14:21	JacolynDandreano	yes. If a candidate gets a certain amount of votes in the primaries, the party has no choice. But if they don't get enough votes, they can lose the nomination even if they had the most
2016-03-13 21:14:43	yama	there's a "meme" here that the government buys votes with choripanes
2016-03-13 21:15:45	JacolynDandreano	it is what might happen with trump.  Right now none of the other republicans are close to beating him but they haven't dropped out, because the few votes they are getting are taking away from the overall votes he has, so he will win the overall republican primaries and the Republican Party might be able to pick Rubio or Cruz instead
2016-03-13 21:16:01	JacolynDandreano	what are choripanes
2016-03-13 21:16:09	yama	u know chorizos right
2016-03-13 21:18:01	JacolynDandreano	The sausage?
2016-03-13 21:18:06	yama	yeah
2016-03-13 21:18:15	yama	do u know what pan is?
2016-03-13 21:20:05	JacolynDandreano	Bread?
2016-03-13 21:21:07	yama	yes
2016-03-13 21:21:13	yama	basically a chorizo sandwich
2016-03-13 21:21:18	yama	usually with chimichurri
2016-03-13 21:26:49	JacolynDandreano	Chimichurri? Is that a salsa or something
2016-03-13 21:27:08	yama	yes
2016-03-13 21:27:22	JacolynDandreano	Oh it looks like a pesto on google
2016-03-13 21:59:32	JacolynDandreano	U died
2016-03-13 21:59:37	yama	pesto is with oil right?
2016-03-13 22:00:00	JacolynDandreano	I don't know. I only made it once
2016-03-13 22:00:04	JacolynDandreano	and I can't remember
2016-03-13 22:00:12	yama	wow make it more often

2016-03-13 22:01:38	yama	in the past
2016-03-13 22:01:41	yama	i should make it again
2016-03-13 22:01:47	JacolynDandreano	then why are u asking if it is made with oil :)
2016-03-13 22:02:08	yama	cause i dont remember
2016-03-13 22:02:14	yama	but chimichurri is with vinegar
2016-03-13 22:02:56	JacolynDandreano	Oh
2016-03-13 22:03:08	JacolynDandreano	but other similar ingredients?
2016-03-13 22:03:08	yama	and a bunch of stuff
2016-03-13 22:03:17	yama	probably just the garlic
2016-03-13 22:04:29	JacolynDandreano	Looks good
