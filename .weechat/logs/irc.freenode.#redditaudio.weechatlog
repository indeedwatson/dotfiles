2015-10-23 13:50:05	shrimants	they are exactly in the same category as a usual shit 2.1 computer desktop speaker
2015-10-23 13:50:28	shrimants	but if your goal is "no sound" vs "sound", they'll get the job done
2015-10-23 13:50:40	shrimants	IE better than nothing

2015-10-23 13:51:25	namelessghoul	hello
2015-10-23 13:51:43	shrimants	believe it or not, not all speaker drivers are created equal. that is a HUGE portion of what makes a speaker sound good, the quality of the driver
2015-10-23 13:52:30	shrimants	after that, theres a ton of physics and theory and measurement/calibration that goes into actually creating a box with the right volume and the right shape and the right ports
2015-10-23 13:52:46	shrimants	and after that theres a lot that goes into placing them correctly in the room and stopping them from fucking up their own sound

2015-10-23 13:53:00	shrimants	not to mention the crossover design
2015-10-23 13:53:01	indeedwatson	yeah i can imagine
2015-10-23 13:53:08	namelessghoul	would the sony walkman NW-ZX1 + sennheiser ie80s be a good combo for a "beginner" audiophile? i play flac/mp3 320 cbr.
2015-10-23 13:53:31	shrimants	id say the walkman is a retardedly overpriced thing
2015-10-23 13:53:43	indeedwatson	the thing is i have a hard time determining which sound better, i'd need to do quick and blind AB testing
2015-10-23 13:53:49	namelessghoul	okay...
2015-10-23 13:54:03	shrimants	and the IE80 i listened to i didnt realize they had that bass knob doodad
2015-10-23 13:54:14	shrimants	but supposedly they're good
2015-10-23 13:54:15	UncleRuckus	namelessghoul: check out the iBasso dx80 that just got announced
2015-10-23 13:54:24	shrimants	honestly i wouldnt consider it a "beginner" setup though
2015-10-23 13:54:24	UncleRuckus	For a dap
2015-10-23 13:54:35	UncleRuckus	I also just got the Shanling m3 which is excellent for the price imo
2015-10-23 13:54:36	shrimants	mid grade
2015-10-23 13:54:38	shrimants	at least
2015-10-23 13:54:46	shrimants	personally i use my phone
2015-10-23 13:54:47	UncleRuckus	Way cheaper than the Sony you are talking about
2015-10-23 13:55:02	UncleRuckus	shrimants: that's because you're a noob 😛
2015-10-23 13:55:06	namelessghoul	i have the galaxy s6, it doesn't have enough storage
2015-10-23 13:55:09	shrimants	its because it gets the job done
2015-10-23 13:55:16	namelessghoul	i'll check it out uncleruckus
2015-10-23 13:55:33	shrimants	64gb nexus 6, convert tracks from flac to 320 before transfer, done
2015-10-23 13:55:51	namelessghoul	?
2015-10-23 13:56:57	shrimants	my whole library is flac, i just convert to 320kbps mp3 for portable usage
2015-10-23 13:57:06	namelessghoul	same
2015-10-23 13:57:17	shrimants	granted, i only have like 35 gigs of flac music
2015-10-23 13:57:34	namelessghoul	i have far more than that
2015-10-23 13:57:35	shrimants	or something like that
2015-10-23 13:58:44	namelessghoul	do you like the ie80s, shrimants?
2015-10-23 13:58:58	shrimants	i dunno, like i said i had no idea there was a bass knob on there
2015-10-23 13:59:13	shrimants	and unfortunately the knob on the pair i was listening to was turned all the way up from prior testing
2015-10-23 13:59:19	shrimants	so it sounded like shit
2015-10-23 13:59:27	shrimants	im sure you can tweak it to your personal preferences though
2015-10-23 13:59:48	shrimants	i use RHA T10i

2015-10-23 14:00:33	namelessghoul	what kind of music do you listen to?
2015-10-23 14:01:31	namelessghoul	i like hard rock, alternative, symphonic metal, female vocalists
2015-10-23 14:01:49	shrimants	some classic rock, some alt rock, electronic, bit of metal
2015-10-23 14:01:49	namelessghoul	i've been trying to find the right pair but having a hard time
2015-10-23 14:02:00	shrimants	lot of audiobooks
2015-10-23 14:02:57	hitek	I do like the fact they brought back a "walkman" though
2015-10-23 14:03:12	namelessghoul	the ibasso looks nice, but i wouldn't be able to get spotify on it, would i?
2015-10-23 14:03:28	shrimants	again, i use my phone :P
2015-10-23 14:03:40	UncleRuckus	namelessghoul: ah, if you're looking for Spotify that makes more sense you're looking for something Android based
2015-10-23 14:03:41	namelessghoul	i like that the walkman has android os
2015-10-23 14:03:42	shrimants	spotify, pandora, etc, all through a device with a dedicated internet connection
2015-10-23 14:03:50	namelessghoul	yeah
2015-10-23 14:03:57	UncleRuckus	Well there is that new DAP from onkyo and another one from pioneer that both look pretty decent
2015-10-23 14:04:06	UncleRuckus	Both Android based
2015-10-23 14:04:07	shrimants	honestly the higher end phones nowadays have great frequency response
2015-10-23 14:04:13	shrimants	though a somewhat underpowered amp
2015-10-23 14:04:32	UncleRuckus	Also the fiio x7 is Android based and will probably be a cheaper option
2015-10-23 14:04:37	namelessghoul	would buying an ipod classic be stupid?
2015-10-23 14:04:44	shrimants	probably
2015-10-23 14:04:57	shrimants	considering you need itunes to transfer, and itunes refuses to recognize flac
2015-10-23 14:04:58	namelessghoul	it doesn't have apps
2015-10-23 14:05:07	namelessghoul	i use itunes though
2015-10-23 14:05:13	shrimants	with flac?
2015-10-23 14:05:19	namelessghoul	320 cbr
2015-10-23 14:05:24	shrimants	oh then it wont matter
2015-10-23 14:05:34	shrimants	but if i had to go apple, id get an itouch
2015-10-23 14:05:36	namelessghoul	i've had my library for 10 years
2015-10-23 14:05:48	namelessghoul	85% of my songs are rated
2015-10-23 14:06:25	namelessghoul	i wonder how it would migrate to sony's media library software
2015-10-23 14:06:49	namelessghoul	i can't afford the fiio x7
2015-10-23 14:07:28	shrimants	indeedwatson: i think what you need to do is A/B with a proper set of speakers
2015-10-23 14:07:54	shrimants	even a budget ass cheap pair like pioneer BS22
2015-10-23 14:09:14	indeedwatson	shrimants: im planning on buying proper speakers, but i live in argentina so doing research as to what is good bang for the buck is complicated
2015-10-23 14:09:19	UncleRuckus	namelessghoul: ipod touch would work though, you'd get all your streaming apps
2015-10-23 14:09:22	shrimants	ah drag
2015-10-23 14:09:27	indeedwatson	those you mention for example aren't available 
2015-10-23 14:09:38	indeedwatson	i've been looking at something like Edifier RT1600
2015-10-23 14:09:40	shrimants	is diy an option?
2015-10-23 14:09:48	UncleRuckus	haha, was about to ask the same
2015-10-23 14:09:50	shrimants	if you dont care about making it look good, all you need is glue and clamps
2015-10-23 14:10:01	indeedwatson	not really, I don't know how or where to get the stuff
2015-10-23 14:10:35	indeedwatson	shrimants: i imagine getting the components would be harder, but if you have a link at hand i'll take a quick look
2015-10-23 14:10:48	shrimants	parts express is what id suggest
2015-10-23 14:10:57	shrimants	but i dont know anything about non US stuff
2015-10-23 14:10:59	UncleRuckus	delivery to argentina might be a bitch though
2015-10-23 14:11:05	indeedwatson	yep, it is
2015-10-23 14:11:16	indeedwatson	%50 tax for starters

2015-10-23 15:36:46	jessie	But it's not inherient to the mediums, it's due to how it's mixed/mastered.

2015-10-23 15:38:24	jessie	You get better dynamic range, no degrading of quality, etc. from your digital sources.
2015-10-23 15:38:27	Aldem	Hearing the cracks and all
2015-10-23 15:39:11	UncleRuckus	Aldem: those aren't arguments though they are opinions
2015-10-23 15:39:12	jessie	The things I like about vinyl is the album art and it's fun to listen to a whole album, no ADD interfering.
2015-10-23 15:39:28	jessie	And you can do fun things on vinyl you can't do with CDs
2015-10-23 15:39:33	Aldem	UncleRuckus: I'm not trying to put arguments on the table.
2015-10-23 15:39:36	UncleRuckus	Technically speaking, same master, digital > vinyl
2015-10-23 15:39:49	jessie	Like James Gang's Yer Album's lead out saying "Play me again" over and over.
2015-10-23 15:39:52	jessie	That's cool
2015-10-23 15:41:22	jessie	And, AFAIK, there's no way to do that through existing digital audio codecs.
2015-10-23 16:02:56	ningu	the loudness war?
2015-10-23 16:03:28	ningu	I live in an apartment, so...
2015-10-23 16:05:28	ningu	people here the other day were saying 30-50W is enough
2015-10-23 16:07:40	shrimants	if you understand how audio works, 15-50w is enough
2015-10-23 16:09:00	jessie	Ha, no meaning that when the tracks are mixed and mastered that they typically go as close to the maximum of dynamic range as possible.
2015-10-23 16:10:18	ningu	oh, ok
2015-10-23 16:10:24	ningu	that's vinyl?
2015-10-23 16:10:30	ningu	I mean typically
2015-10-23 16:14:06	shrimants	i dont understand your question
2015-10-23 16:14:38	shrimants	also, you can get shittily mastered vinyl
2015-10-23 16:15:05	shrimants	and dynamic RANGE is a RANGE. you can record shit super soft and never have any big changes in volume, it will still have a shit dynamic range
2015-10-23 16:16:13	ningu	I just meant whether things mastered for vinyl typically had a wider dynamic range
2015-10-23 16:16:13	shrimants	if your entire band only plays at one volume the whole time, doesnt matter what you do from a recording/mastering perspective, you wont have good dynamic range.
2015-10-23 16:16:23	shrimants	no, thats incorrect
2015-10-23 16:16:37	shrimants	depends on the kind of music you're listening to
2015-10-23 16:16:52	shrimants	classical music has huge differences between the softest notes and loudest notes. same with jazz
2015-10-23 16:16:55	shrimants	metal?
2015-10-23 16:16:57	shrimants	no
2015-10-23 16:17:29	ningu	hehe fair enough
2015-10-23 16:18:17	shrimants	imo some people like the ritual of vinyl
2015-10-23 16:18:24	shrimants	some like the ritual of cds the same way
2015-10-23 16:18:30	shrimants	some just want to play the fucking song
2015-10-23 16:18:40	shrimants	<-----
2015-10-23 16:18:51	ningu	hahah yeah
2015-10-23 16:19:08	ningu	I am fine with digital, when I rip my cds I go for lossless cause why not, but that's about it
2015-10-23 16:22:03	jessie	shrimants: Yeah, sorry, I was in a meeting.
2015-10-23 16:22:19	jessie	Meaning that a lot of pop and other modern music doesn't have much if any dynamic ranche.
2015-10-23 16:22:22	jessie	*range
2015-10-23 16:22:25	jessie	Dunno how that typo happened.
2015-10-23 16:22:40	jessie	But when they master for vinyl they do different mastering so you get more dynamic range.
2015-10-23 16:23:21	shrimants	you get more assuming the song itself had any to begin with
2015-10-23 16:23:39	UncleRuckus	I don't know why its a big deal though if its not in the song
2015-10-23 16:24:08	UncleRuckus	I think it's really stupid when people talk about how dynamic a piece of playback equipment is, as though it somehow adds dynamic range to the music

2015-10-23 16:40:40	UncleRuckus	but its going to take more than a few pairs for them to break even, it was an 8 year project

2015-10-28 12:53:36	jessie	Turns out reflections and echo and such is a huge problem in them. Who knew?

2015-10-28 12:55:38	ningu	echo can produce an interesting effect in the right circumstances I guess. but generally to be avoided, yeah
2015-10-28 12:56:46	jessie	Yeah. I also knew nothing about mixing at the time.
2015-10-28 12:56:56	jessie	And, to be honest, still know very little about it.

2015-10-28 15:23:58	kwall24	like $200-300. I know it's probably a bit unreasonable, but figured i'd check out what you guys have to say about it. i was also gonna check local ads/craigslist/kijiji

2015-10-28 23:23:59	Mrcrummypaws	just buy portapros or some shit

2015-10-28 23:29:04	ningu	is there much empirical info on how significant a piece of a system a dac really is? I've read different stuff which varies from, it's the most critical thing to all are the same, with no cited data...
