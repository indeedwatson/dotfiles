2016-02-25 21:32:12	Riviera	after all, q is just a reverse p
2016-02-25 21:32:59	osse	at one point I tried   /pattern/{d;q}   but I guess the "start next cycle" bit of the d command means the rest of the block is skipped

2016-03-08 19:24:19	indeedwatson	i want to have a script to open different twitch channels with livestreamer. So let's say the script is called livestreamer.sh and within it there's several twitch channels. I want to type in terminal for example: "prec" and have it open twitch.tv/previouslyrecorded_live
2016-03-08 19:24:24	mrrhq	Someone showed me how to do it.
2016-03-08 19:24:35	mrrhq	Oh sorry, I use uBlock so I don't see the ads, lol.
2016-03-08 19:25:10	mrrhq	Then you put the name of the function you want like myfunction() {}, then use ./myscript.sh myfunction
2016-03-08 19:25:18	mrrhq	It's all a bit hard to explain, sorry.

2016-03-08 19:26:24	Riviera	indeedwatson: so you want prec to be a command that does two things:  (1) actually start livestreamer.sh, and (2) to tell livestreamer.sh that it should use a particular channel.
2016-03-08 19:26:38	Riviera	indeedwatson: is that correct?
2016-03-08 19:26:42	indeedwatson	if it's not possible, i'll make a script for each channel

2016-03-08 19:27:05	Riviera	indeedwatson: ok, explain
2016-03-08 19:27:36	indeedwatson	i'll try to put it more abstractly. I have script.sh. Within it there's command A, B and C. I want to type A into terminal and have A be executed
2016-03-08 19:27:52	Riviera	indeedwatson: no
2016-03-08 19:27:57	Riviera	indeedwatson: please do the opposite, be less abstract.
2016-03-08 19:27:59	mrrhq	Oh cool, you know you can use mpv-player with Twitch, and all you need to do is install youtube-dl and put "ytdl" in your mpv.config, then use mpv [twitch-url]
2016-03-08 19:28:20	Riviera	indeedwatson: because, you know, when you type A, A is executed, your abstraction does not have any point.
2016-03-08 19:28:29	mrrhq	Depending on the version of mpv, it may be quvi instead. But I think youtube-dl will work.
2016-03-08 19:28:46	mrrhq	That's what I use to view Twitch.
2016-03-08 19:28:50	indeedwatson	Riviera: it's not executed with my script right now

2016-03-08 19:30:09	sjohnson	... i was way off.
2016-03-08 19:30:22	indeedwatson	p-x: that would go in .bashrc right?
2016-03-08 19:30:28	mrrhq	indeedwatson: ytdl can work with mpv automatically and fetch the stream, sending it to mpv.
2016-03-08 19:30:47	mrrhq	mpv cannot do streams on its own.
2016-03-08 19:30:57	p-x	indeedwatson: yes, you can define it in .bashrc
2016-03-08 19:31:31	indeedwatson	Riviera: i'll show you the script, it's a mess because i know very little about this, hang on
2016-03-08 19:31:52	Riviera	indeedwatson: instead of you doing something random i'd prefer you'd just answer my questions.
2016-03-08 19:32:15	indeedwatson	p-x: i actually had all the channels set up as individual aliases, i thought it'd be more convenient to have it all in an individual script

2016-03-08 19:33:33	indeedwatson	like i said above, i was wondering if there was a way to do it cleaner and have it all in 1 script, instead of having 10 or 15 aliases for twitch channels in bashrc
2016-03-08 19:33:42	Riviera	indeedwatson: no
2016-03-08 19:33:51	indeedwatson	alright
2016-03-08 19:34:09	Riviera	indeedwatson: you can use hard links, which you can understand now as multiple names for the same file
2016-03-08 19:34:33	Riviera	indeedwatson: making the script react differently depending on with which name it was called.

2016-03-08 19:37:09	mrrhq	*not aliases or command names
2016-03-08 19:37:11	indeedwatson	i guess the downside of that is that i would have to do that manually if i want to use the script in another computer. Maybe i'll put the aliases in its own file and include it in .bashrc 
2016-03-08 19:37:30	Riviera	indeedwatson: as an aside:
2016-03-08 19:37:32	Riviera	!.sh > indeedwatson
2016-03-08 19:37:32	greybot	indeedwatson: Don't use extensions for your scripts. Scripts define new commands that you can run, and commands are generally not given extensions. Do you run ls.elf? Also: bash scripts are *not* sh scripts (so don't use .sh) and the extension will only cause dependencies headaches if the script gets rewritten in another language.

2016-03-08 19:39:40	mrrhq	Yeah, the thing is, I could do things like command if I wanted to run an external command, or builtin if I wanted to do only builtin, or even alias if I wanted to make sure it was an alias, but I'm not sure how to run it if it's only a function, I can't just do "eval $i()". that doesn't work.
2016-03-08 19:40:22	izabera	maybe start by reading the guide in the topic
2016-03-08 19:40:23	mrrhq	I'd have to maybe look up a better way to check if it's a function before using eval.

2016-03-08 21:16:56	izabera	you don't need to escape anything

2016-03-08 21:17:28	Asmodee	example: the json API needs to send arguments with: "{\"password\":\"$password\"}" , but if there is " in the password, the API think it ends at the " of the password

2016-03-08 21:42:11	greybot	Some sed(1)s have -i which claims to "modify" files. It does not: sed is not a FILE editor. The -i flag re-writes the entire file and replaces the original with the new. This breaks open handles and hard-link sets, and fails to follow symlinks. -i is also unportable: valid sed on one system will write broken files on another. Use ed(1) or ex(1) instead: eg. ex -sc '%s/a/b/|wq' file

"${var}bar" expands the parameter named "var" while "$varbar" expands "varbar". "$123" references argv[1] and "${123}" references argv[123]. Braces are requried for parameters > 9, special PEs, and array expansions: ${10}, ${var##pat}, ${arr[5]}. BRACES AREN'T A SUBSTITUTE FOR QUOTES!

2016-03-10 10:45:23	osse	I mean, it's technically valid, btu trying to run the desired quality as a program probably doesn't do what you want
2016-03-10 10:45:30	osse	I don't know. I'm not sure what it's trying to do
2016-03-10 10:46:11	indeedwatson	what i explained, launch livestreamer but replace 'ohn' with 'outerheaven' for the channel
2016-03-10 10:47:16	indeedwatson	i lifted the quality bit from here https://www.reddit.com/r/bash/comments/49g4jv/help_me_write_a_livestreamer_script/
2016-03-10 10:47:16	osse	but what is the logic behind having four similar lines like that? you only want to execute one of them right?

2016-03-10 10:47:47	indeedwatson	the logic is that i might want to execute ohn, or i might want to execute santzo, or prec
2016-03-10 10:48:12	osse	then you could have a similar case ... esac that checks $1
2016-03-10 10:48:19	osse	similar to how the existing one checks $2

But I need to add two parameters in script call. Now, I have to allow parallel executions, since the script is running with different databases.

2016-03-10 16:45:27	greybot	Do NOT use SIGKILL (kill -9) to terminate processes. All processes will terminate in response to the default SIGTERM. If they don't terminate instantly, that's because they're busy cleaning up. If you interrupt them, you break them. See http://stackoverflow.com/a/690631/347411

2016-03-10 17:17:48	kotoReZ	Hello. I am new to bash. Is there anyway to count the number of arguments user inputted into "read" command. What command would I have to use?
2016-03-10 17:18:20	greycat	read does not read arguments.  it reads a string.  if you want to split a string into words and then count the words, I would suggest that you use "read -a" instead, to read directly into an array.

All other variable names should be lowercase. Since variable names are case-sensitive, this convention avoids accidentally overriding environmental and internal variables.

2016-03-11 20:56:30	bridger	I guess my thought process was this is the parameter that I want you to look through, if the line doens't start with C

2016-03-11 20:57:57	bridger	Okay I am starting to get it.
2016-03-11 20:59:01	bridger	so with grep '^[^C].*C', it still shows a C starting a line, why is that?
2016-03-11 21:00:04	osse	is there whitespace in front of it?
2016-03-11 21:00:22	bridger	yes
2016-03-11 21:00:23	bridger	indented
2016-03-11 21:00:42	osse	that explains it
2016-03-11 21:00:53	osse	the first character on the line is not a C

2016-03-11 21:13:54	osse	bridger: with  ^[[:space:]]*[^C] you can let grep cheat. because it can match one fewer spaces than there are in the indentation and then it has one space to spare which neatly matches [^C] because it's not a C but a space.
2016-03-11 21:14:30	bridger	I'll be honest with you. that's pretty cool
2016-03-11 21:14:43	bridger	10/10 would learn from you guys again
2016-03-11 21:14:49	osse	so you need to add that after a bunch of spaces the next character is *not* a space (and also not a C of course, which was the original problem)
2016-03-11 21:14:55	osse	hence [^C[:space:]]

2016-03-12 00:32:25	izabera	If a shell script calls <any external command>, <any external command> knows nothing about your functions
2016-03-12 00:32:26	Moonchopper	nm, forgot I was calling it with a ssh -t, so that answers my questino
2016-03-12 00:32:34	Moonchopper	So it's actually calling ssh
2016-03-12 00:32:36	izabera	that doesn't answer
2016-03-12 00:33:03	Moonchopper	Well, it fits with your answer - I'm calling ssh -t, and I'm calling ssh as an external command
2016-03-12 00:33:37	Moonchopper	Which precludes the 'remote' script from knowing anything about my 'parent script'

2016-03-12 11:19:02	d0uglas	hi #bash, I'm toying with curl to pass alerts through the pushbullet api. They may not allow it, but what might be a good guess as to what text I could send within a curl'ed note to make a line break? Or to subtract pushbullet from this to make it less off-topic, what does a line break look like in a bash script?

2016-03-12 11:19:39	go|dfish	miesco: well "progressively" - but there may be buffering by your OS

I've followed instructions from this how-to (http://www.codefx.biz/2012/01/proftpd-making-apache-owner-uploaded-files-directories). It's working with files, but the directories are failing to upload. It gives the error " root chmod(/public/dstXXccqYov) failed: Operation not permitted" in the log file. What can I do? Thanks

2016-03-12 13:51:46	geirha	e.g.   echo "foo bar" | read -r var1 var2   vs   read -r var1 var2 <<< "foo bar"

2016-03-12 16:44:36	gtristan	rofelmao, most interpretors have an interactive mode, like the shell that you type in and say 'ls' or whatever... this is not unique to bash
2016-03-12 16:44:41	rofelmao	Simple thing like rm to remove, or convert to convert image using ImageMagick, etc.
2016-03-12 16:44:50	rofelmao	OH!
2016-03-12 16:44:55	gtristan	rofelmao, i.e. if you type 'python' you will have an interactive shell
2016-03-12 16:45:03	gtristan	but you can also have a python script
2016-03-12 16:45:15	rofelmao	I understand now. I is like when you use node for NodeJS own shell right?
2016-03-12 16:45:25	rofelmao	*It is like...
2016-03-12 16:45:34	gtristan	sure, that's also an interpretor
2016-03-12 16:45:47	rofelmao	Yea okay! I understand this part now.

2016-03-12 16:46:41	gtristan	rofelmao, login shells is more complicated, they are sensitive... you have a program, usually /bin/login, which authenticates a user and starts a shell
2016-03-12 16:46:56	gtristan	usually there is this whole PAM hell you have to go through to set it up right
2016-03-12 16:47:04	rofelmao	Okay.
2016-03-12 16:47:07	gtristan	i.e. if your integrating/building a system from scratch
2016-03-12 16:47:26	gtristan	those are basically when you ssh into your machine, or login to a real tty

2016-03-12 16:48:49	fuzzybear3965	It seems to change the input file separator to semicolon and the break the string $string up into an arary.
2016-03-12 16:48:51	gtristan	when your system launches gdm, though, it will have this whole pam conversation with login and authenticate for you and spawn X on the tty (I think, I'm a bit rusty there), so anyway, that X server will run... and the terminals you spawn in there are virtual (they are not login shells)
2016-03-12 16:49:00	fuzzybear3965	*array based on the contents of $string.
2016-03-12 16:49:03	rofelmao	Okay. So what does make it differences to my environmental variables?
2016-03-12 16:49:14	fuzzybear3965	$string is probably a string delimited by ';'s.
2016-03-12 16:49:38	gtristan	rofelmao, environment variables are not a bash thing, first keep that in mind
2016-03-12 16:49:45	fuzzybear3965	It comes from here: https://github.com/PatWie/GitLab-LaTeX-CI/blob/master/hook/hook.sh#L8 .

2016-03-12 16:51:45	rofelmao	gristan, okay the thing I know is that .profile loads when I logged into a profile.
2016-03-12 16:51:52	gtristan	rofelmao, when you start emacs... it reads files it thinks the user might have stored preferences in, like .emacsrc
2016-03-12 16:52:02	gtristan	bash is similar in that way

2016-03-12 16:59:10	gtristan	rofelmao, why not restart: What environment variable do you want to have set automatically, and why ?
2016-03-12 16:59:14	rofelmao	I came from using Windows 2 weeks ago. I usually put my environment variable in terminal session using export, so if I close the terminal the variables gone. I want to achieve to get permanent temporary variables like in Windows if not better.
2016-03-12 16:59:41	*	gtristan has never used Windows 2 :)
2016-03-12 16:59:47	gtristan	tried 3.1 though
2016-03-12 16:59:50	rofelmao	Basically just NodeJS and MongoDB.

2016-03-12 17:01:21	gtristan	rofelmao, like *what* variable ?
2016-03-12 17:01:43	fuzzybear3965	rofelmao, then add them to .bashrc.
2016-03-12 17:02:00	rofelmao	I put path to NodeJS and MongoDB executable.
2016-03-12 17:02:02	fuzzybear3965	If you want persistence then you need to add them to your "account", just like you would in the environment variables editor in Windows.
2016-03-12 17:02:04	gtristan	rofelmao, its quite different story if you want to set... say... GTK_IMMODULES... or a preference of how you want your shell to work
2016-03-12 17:02:30	fuzzybear3965	rofelmao, are you trying to change the PATH variable?
2016-03-12 17:02:33	rofelmao	fuzzybear3965, In that case I put it in .profile right?
2016-03-12 17:02:40	rofelmao	fuzzybear3965, I want to add not change.

2016-03-12 17:03:54	fuzzybear3965	rofelmao, use export.

2016-03-12 20:05:32	llua	does the signal have to be SIGUSR1?
2016-03-12 20:07:25	_val_	ngomes: it will just send a SIGNAL to a process to inform you about it's status.
2016-03-12 20:08:57	llua	you could use suspend; and get some kind of `achievement unlocked' for being the first questioner that has a usecase for it.
2016-03-12 20:09:12	ngomes	llua, i choose SIGUSR1 because it wont do much to the script , only to trigger some code into script , i don't know all signals but i know its many , perhaps other would do good too.

2016-03-12 20:49:48	pj	so you can catch CTRL-Z, but it is possible to send an explicitl SIGSTOP that cannot be caught.

2016-03-12 21:23:15	twkm	you need to handle fd 2.
2016-03-12 21:23:23	cnap	so I am doing: var=$(script --args)
2016-03-12 21:23:35	twkm	that captures only fd 1.
2016-03-12 21:23:36	cnap	shouldn’t that also save all that go to stderr to $var ?
2016-03-12 21:23:40		grepper has joined #bash
2016-03-12 21:23:43	llua	no
2016-03-12 21:23:54	cnap	ok then i tried: var=$(script —args 2>&1)
2016-03-12 21:23:58	cnap	but nothing again
2016-03-12 21:24:37	twkm	some things write to your terminal more directly.  use expect or script or screen or ...
2016-03-12 21:25:09	cnap	twkm: Let me check up expect, i dont remember how it works, thanks

2016-03-12 21:37:14	bray90820	can I ln the contaHow would I ln the contents of a directory
2016-03-12 21:37:20	bray90820	Sorry let me repay that
2016-03-12 21:37:27	bray90820	How would I ln the contents of a directory
2016-03-12 21:38:02	twkm	by either ln -s the directory itself or each member into another directory.
2016-03-12 21:40:16	twkm	ln -s existingdir newdir  vs  ln existingdir/* otherexisting/  -- the latter could be -s as well.
2016-03-12 21:40:57	cnap	hmm this "nbt_results=$(script -c 'nbtscan -r $manual')" is failing for some reason
2016-03-12 21:41:31	twkm	you didn't read how to use the script command.

2016-03-12 21:42:50	yitz_	So putting "script" in the same context must work!
2016-03-12 21:42:51	twkm	except that it isn't fine.

2016-03-12 21:46:24	bray90820	Here is my issue
2016-03-12 21:47:14		denisk has joined #bash
2016-03-12 21:47:29	bray90820	i have two directories dir1 and dir2 I am currently in dir1 and i wanna ln of everything in dir2 and put it in dir1 without leaving dir1
2016-03-12 21:48:07	bray90820	Recursively if possible
2016-03-12 21:48:08	twkm	"and put it in dir1" i do not understand, but surely you can transform "dir1" to ".".
2016-03-12 21:48:32	bray90820	I want the hard links in dir1
2016-03-12 21:48:48	twkm	ln dir2/* dir1/
2016-03-12 21:49:04		DurstBurger has joined #bash
2016-03-12 21:50:14	twkm	recursion would suggest using find to produce an identical directory tree followed by find again to link the files.  or use a utility with that ability.
2016-03-12 21:51:43	twkm	some cp's can do that.
2016-03-12 21:52:26	bray90820	twkm: since I am doing this daily and each folder will have the current date and time i can't input the name of dir1

2016-03-12 21:57:31	twkm	how do you expect manual to be expanded inside of '-quotes?

2016-03-12 21:57:47	cnap	twkm: yeah i know thats what i dont know
2016-03-12 21:58:25	cnap	I will just concatenate
2016-03-12 21:58:32	cnap	I just saw its not possible
2016-03-12 21:58:32	twkm	exit seems redundant, but whatever.  the key would be to read the file to which script writes all of the executed command's output.
2016-03-12 21:58:52	cnap	which is typescript
2016-03-12 21:59:04	cnap	yeah i understand better now, thanks

2016-03-12 22:01:19	twkm	then you can't capture its errors.

2016-03-12 22:08:48	twkm	bash won't automatically record it though you might see if you can sneak it into the timestamp.
