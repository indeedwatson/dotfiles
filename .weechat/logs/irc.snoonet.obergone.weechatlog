2015-10-23 01:53:27	Obergone	what does one do with an extra adderall capsule when you aren't working on a programming side project
2015-10-23 01:53:39	inddwtsn	what is adderall
2015-10-23 01:54:19	Obergone	Dextroamphetamine
2015-10-23 01:54:51	inddwtsn	why do you have that
2015-10-23 01:55:18	Obergone	because i wanted to get work done
2015-10-23 01:55:34	Obergone	but i never had a full day to get that work done on adderall
2015-10-23 01:55:43	Obergone	so it just got done little by little over a month or so
2015-10-23 01:56:01	inddwtsn	you need drugs to work?
2015-10-23 01:56:35	Obergone	not to work, but to get an inordinate amount of work done
2015-10-23 01:57:38	Obergone	but what do i do with left over
2015-10-23 01:57:45	Obergone	you're not being helpful watson
2015-10-23 01:57:57	inddwtsn	is it trippy
2015-10-23 01:58:13	Obergone	no
2015-10-23 01:58:32	Obergone	it just makes you really really focussed for a full day
2015-10-23 01:58:35	inddwtsn	meh
2015-10-23 01:58:38	inddwtsn	uh
2015-10-23 01:58:41	inddwtsn	i'd watch movies

2015-10-23 01:58:45	Obergone	lmao
2015-10-23 01:58:48	inddwtsn	so basically what i do 
2015-10-23 01:58:54	Obergone	buttt
2015-10-23 01:58:56	inddwtsn	or play a gaem
2015-10-23 01:59:01	inddwtsn	boob
2015-10-23 01:59:08	Obergone	next weekend we got some acid
2015-10-23 01:59:13	Obergone	for a camping trip
2015-10-23 01:59:16	Obergone	i'm pumped
2015-10-23 01:59:23	inddwtsn	send me some
2015-10-23 01:59:25	Obergone	never tried it before
2015-10-23 01:59:47	inddwtsn	oh
2015-10-23 01:59:54	inddwtsn	it can be intense
2015-10-23 02:00:17	inddwtsn	i'd bring music
2015-10-23 02:01:45	Obergone	i'm super stressed at work and have a giant nagging feeling that i'mma get fired
2015-10-23 02:01:58	Obergone	so i'm kind of assuming that i'll have a terrible paranoid trip
2015-10-23 02:02:16	inddwtsn	who are you doing it with
2015-10-23 02:02:50	Obergone	prolly 5 of us total
2015-10-23 02:02:57	Obergone	though one doesn't want to partake
2015-10-23 02:03:01	Obergone	just close friends
2015-10-23 02:03:22	inddwtsn	ye the n1 thing is to feel comfortable
2015-10-23 02:03:34	inddwtsn	my trip lasted for like 10 hours
2015-10-23 02:03:51	Obergone	jesus
2015-10-23 02:03:53	inddwtsn	why do you think you're gonna get fired
2015-10-23 02:05:29	Obergone	because i moved to new department and have new project manager who is just never happy with me
2015-10-23 02:05:40	Obergone	and i'm the only one he manages so he just bugs me all day
2015-10-23 02:05:49	Obergone	and wants me to talk to him more and more
2015-10-23 02:05:56	Obergone	and i just want to program my shit
2015-10-23 02:06:13	Obergone	any tiny issue needs a big explanation
2015-10-23 02:06:20	Obergone	he has too much time on his hands
2015-10-23 02:07:02	Obergone	he pulls time estimates out of his ass and then makes promises to other people in business
2015-10-23 02:07:38	Obergone	apparently he promised to get something out in 30-45 minutes and it was something that i needed at least a day if not a day and a half to get working
2015-10-23 02:12:17	Obergone	no feedback inddwtsn
2015-10-23 02:15:10	inddwtsn	sorry im sleepy
2015-10-23 02:15:23	inddwtsn	they'd fire you right after moving you there?
