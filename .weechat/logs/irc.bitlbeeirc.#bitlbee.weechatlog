2015-08-18 15:39:06	krisfremen	but.. nope
2015-08-18 15:39:20	dx	for example the list of notes in the home page is an inline directive with archive="yes". it can be tuned with some templating, but it's still too simple for my taste
2015-08-18 15:39:40	krisfremen	Gitit came close.. but it's... weird
2015-08-18 15:39:50	dx	and it seems like ikiwiki has some powerful metadata management stuff behind the scenes

2015-08-18 17:29:03	gholms	If you think that's bad wait until you try building chromium.
2015-08-18 17:29:54	jgeboski	libreoffice is by far the worst
2015-08-18 17:31:05	gholms	It bundles so many libraries that it is literally impossible to link the executable on a 32-bit computer.
2015-08-18 17:31:54	krisfremen	well, if I'm building chromium.. I probably won't be doing it on a headless $5 512MB ram vps

2015-08-18 17:33:36	krisfremen	yeah, but I'd rather not
2015-08-18 17:33:38	MK_FG	pypy also takes like 10+ gigs of ram to build iirc
2015-08-18 17:33:44	gholms	It'll take a week to finish running the program, but what's the rush?  :P
2015-08-18 17:33:53	jgeboski	yeah lmao
2015-08-18 17:33:58	gholms	pypy takes about 3.
2015-08-18 17:34:15	MK_FG	Fairly sure it was way more
2015-08-18 17:34:35	krisfremen	that's what she said
2015-08-18 17:34:49	gholms	If I hadn't built it in a 32-bit environment I'd go back and double-check, but meh.

2015-08-18 17:35:21	krisfremen	hmm.. I need to bring botlbee back
2015-08-18 17:35:28	gholms	Heh
2015-08-18 17:35:45	MK_FG	Yeah, google says "2 GB of memory on a 32-bit machine and 4GB on a 64-bit machine."
2015-08-18 17:36:05	gholms	That sounds more like it

2015-08-18 17:38:05	krisfremen	anyway.. I have a question for you guys
2015-08-18 17:38:26	krisfremen	how much would you pay for a DNS service?
2015-08-18 17:38:36	gholms	What do you need it to do?
2015-08-18 17:38:53	krisfremen	my company is trying to launch a product.. which isn't even real DNS.. but they market it as DNS..
2015-08-18 17:39:03	krisfremen	and they're planning on charging like $40/year for it
2015-08-18 17:39:16	krisfremen	and all it does is resolve IP
2015-08-18 17:39:35	krisfremen	so I need input from devs and non-devs
2015-08-18 17:39:48	krisfremen	so I can make a spreadsheet telling them how stupid their pricing is
2015-08-18 17:39:51	gholms	I can get that service from dns.he.net for free.
2015-08-18 17:39:58	gholms	Better, in fact
2015-08-18 17:40:07	tribut	so... 8.8.8.8 but it costs money?
2015-08-18 17:40:30	krisfremen	no, as in we act as a dns server.. something like dyndns
2015-08-18 17:40:49	krisfremen	but very hackishly done. because the idiots before who handled this.. apparently couldn't code for shit
2015-08-18 17:41:04	krisfremen	they must've been on crack all the time
2015-08-18 17:41:07	gholms	Yeah... there's a service that already does that and more.  For free.
2015-08-18 17:41:12	gholms	As in, the price is zero.
2015-08-18 17:41:29	krisfremen	I know, I tried to tell them that, but they don't want to listen
2015-08-18 17:41:34	gholms	That's how much I would pay for something that braindead.
2015-08-18 17:41:43	krisfremen	it's currently being offered as free, but they want to "monetise" it
2015-08-18 17:41:48	krisfremen	because they're losing money
2015-08-18 17:41:49	MK_FG	I'd probably setup it myself anyway
2015-08-18 17:41:59	MK_FG	Also not worth paying, really
2015-08-18 17:42:00	krisfremen	I mean.. first of, they're using windows servers.. on amazon ec2
2015-08-18 17:42:02	krisfremen	lolol
2015-08-18 17:42:18	gholms	Cool, but for that it would need to actually have value.
2015-08-18 17:42:22	krisfremen	like $4000 per month
2015-08-18 17:43:06	gholms	No one in my price range was willing to support all of the features I want, so I'm doing everything myself for ~15 USD per month.
2015-08-18 17:43:36	krisfremen	well.. it's a security company that I work for now, so this is basically a way for customers to get to their devices
2015-08-18 17:43:48	krisfremen	arm/disarm and see the video
2015-08-18 17:43:59	MK_FG	Eh, people pay for weirder stuff
2015-08-18 17:44:11	krisfremen	on top of the security devices themselves being over the top expensive
