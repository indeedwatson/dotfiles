2015-12-31 23:27:07	inddwtsn	the very core of my being is incompatible with social hobbies
2015-12-31 23:27:31	OberonTheFeared	that's nice but there's no qts hanging around in your house
2015-12-31 23:27:31	inddwtsn	my main problem is not living alone
2015-12-31 23:27:42	OberonTheFeared	ah
2015-12-31 23:27:47	OberonTheFeared	what's the solution to this?
2015-12-31 23:28:29	inddwtsn	a proper job, career, a plan, questioning the essence of my day to day life
2015-12-31 23:30:28	inddwtsn	when i think about last year when i was dating 2 cute girls the main differnce is that i was mostly living alone

2015-12-31 23:37:08	OberonTheFeared	js
2015-12-31 23:37:14	OberonTheFeared	i called this a while back
2015-12-31 23:37:37	inddwtsn	meh i feel i'd be better doing something more creative
2015-12-31 23:37:38	inddwtsn	idk
2015-12-31 23:37:48	inddwtsn	it stresses me
2015-12-31 23:38:24	OberonTheFeared	it should be freeing
2015-12-31 23:38:32	OberonTheFeared	you can pick something you love
2015-12-31 23:38:49	OberonTheFeared	another year is going to pass regardless of if you're proactive about it
2015-12-31 23:39:17	OberonTheFeared	the only difference is when 2017 is coming around you could potentially have been setting yourself up for something more
2015-12-31 23:39:27	OberonTheFeared	or you could be level 100 on steam
2015-12-31 23:39:42	inddwtsn	lol
2015-12-31 23:39:47	inddwtsn	as if steam levels did anything
2015-12-31 23:40:22	inddwtsn	i just consume too much media and produce nothing
2015-12-31 23:40:27	inddwtsn	i feel i should contribute something
2015-12-31 23:41:36	OberonTheFeared	you should
2015-12-31 23:41:41	OberonTheFeared	youre too smart not to
2015-12-31 23:41:54	inddwtsn	i don't feel that way
2015-12-31 23:42:05	inddwtsn	not until i manage to actually do something
2015-12-31 23:42:54	inddwtsn	im planning a trip this year which is something i never did, so that's a change at least
2015-12-31 23:43:01	OberonTheFeared	where to?
2015-12-31 23:43:18	inddwtsn	don't know yet
2015-12-31 23:43:22	inddwtsn	im just saving up
2015-12-31 23:43:41	OberonTheFeared	i was apprehensive to jointhe rat race of a legit 9-5 profession
2015-12-31 23:43:44	OberonTheFeared	but money is power
2015-12-31 23:43:47	OberonTheFeared	it's fucked
2015-12-31 23:43:48	inddwtsn	will buy an AC soon and then keep saving and try to make a trip like in the middle of the year cause it's usually cheaper
2015-12-31 23:43:49	OberonTheFeared	but true
2015-12-31 23:44:05	inddwtsn	depends what you want i guess
2015-12-31 23:44:36	inddwtsn	the reason i have this job and im not looking for a 9-5 is cause i'd feel like shit sacrifizing more time
2015-12-31 23:44:37	OberonTheFeared	eh until you have  X amount, it does matter
2015-12-31 23:45:17	OberonTheFeared	right, and giving up time does suck
2015-12-31 23:45:24	OberonTheFeared	but money is power
2015-12-31 23:45:54	OberonTheFeared	in feb i'll get a 10-15k bonus and that will likely be the down payment on a house
2015-12-31 23:46:14	inddwtsn	nice
2015-12-31 23:46:44	OberonTheFeared	at least it will enable me to leave this shitty place and move somewhere that i want to live
2015-12-31 23:47:28	OberonTheFeared	and you can gain skill and put the work in, then decide to put the brakes on things
2015-12-31 23:47:34	inddwtsn	i gtg take care of doges until the fireworks pass
2015-12-31 23:47:36	OberonTheFeared	become a consultant working as much as you want

2016-01-01 12:38:22	OberonTheFeared	because i was high as shit and knew i was too incapacitated to help him fully
2016-01-01 12:38:32	OberonTheFeared	and i felt really out of control
2016-01-01 12:38:50	OberonTheFeared	and people were talking to me like a child
2016-01-01 12:39:40	inddwtsn	dude give me some context
2016-01-01 12:39:45	OberonTheFeared	from the very beginning it started to suck

2016-01-01 12:39:55	OberonTheFeared	dancing/drinking
2016-01-01 12:40:11	inddwtsn	so you took a drug for the first time while you were in public
2016-01-01 12:40:15	inddwtsn	and combined with alcohol?
2016-01-01 12:40:23	OberonTheFeared	we got kicked and then some friends of friends drove us back to one of their place
2016-01-01 12:40:34	inddwtsn	why did you get kicked
2016-01-01 12:40:55	OberonTheFeared	because starman passed out face first on one of their couches
2016-01-01 12:41:35	OberonTheFeared	basically i was trying to babysit him all night
2016-01-01 12:41:45	OberonTheFeared	but i knew i wasn't straight
2016-01-01 12:42:24	OberonTheFeared	p sure if i wasn't therer he was going to get mouth/butt raped by this guy
2016-01-01 12:42:39	OberonTheFeared	starman kept giving him hand massages
