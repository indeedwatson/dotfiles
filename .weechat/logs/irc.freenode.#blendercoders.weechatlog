2015-11-08 11:33:33	ideasman42	so changing target definitions will rebuild all
2015-11-08 11:33:35	steveire	ideasman42: I don't know when openexr 2.2 is from, but I'm guessing 2015 :). I don't really want to tell you which version to require, but couldn't the install deps script take care of it anyway?
2015-11-08 11:33:41	ideasman42	\o mont29 /
2015-11-08 11:34:06	steveire	ideasman42: There are ways around that, such as using static libraries.
2015-11-08 11:34:27	steveire	But again, I don't know enough about the blender buildsystem to know why things like that are as they are :).
2015-11-08 11:35:10	ideasman42	mont29, hackerman- ~ checking on second opinion for bumping cmake to 3.+
2015-11-08 11:35:21	mont29	ideasman42: hey :)
2015-11-08 11:35:29	ideasman42	steveire, we arent cmake experts at all
2015-11-08 11:35:51	ideasman42	we keep it functional on all platforms. but further dont attempt to be overly innovative :)
2015-11-08 11:36:45	mont29	ideasman42: no issue from my side, gues hackerman- could be more conservative though ;)
2015-11-08 11:36:54	ideasman42	expect so :)
2015-11-08 11:37:10	steveire	I see. If changes to compile definitions causing too many rebuilds is a relevant problem, that can probably be investigated anyway to see if there are possibilities to avoid the problem. That's all I mean :).
2015-11-08 11:37:39	ideasman42	steveire, can see in some cases its better - sure
2015-11-08 11:38:10	ideasman42	something I would like to solve longer term is to make use of cmakes library dependancy solving
2015-11-08 11:38:18	ideasman42	currently we do manually
2015-11-08 11:39:37	ideasman42	Juicyfruit, ping also...
2015-11-08 11:39:42	steveire	Is that done manually just 'because it has always been done that way', or was there at some point a problem which made that the appropriate thing to do?
2015-11-08 11:39:49	ideasman42	but seems guys are having relaxed lunch in Eu :)
2015-11-08 11:40:17	ideasman42	steveire, its done because we have multiple configurations for the same library
2015-11-08 11:40:26	steveire	Ah, I see :)
2015-11-08 11:40:31	ideasman42	We build a binary that links to stubs
2015-11-08 11:41:01	ideasman42	I checked on having multiple configs per target, and some way to swap
2015-11-08 11:41:26	ideasman42	seems not impossible, the variables can be accessed, but quite involved still
2015-11-08 11:42:22	steveire	Building with multiple configurations is something I've had my head in for quite some time http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=14539

2015-11-08 12:24:00	*	kaito is working on applying subsidy for 2.8 projects... its semi useless paperwork we can't use in practice, only the money will come in handy :)
2015-11-08 12:24:48	kaito	i wouldn't mind it if we keep things relaxed and without pressure this month
2015-11-08 12:24:59	kaito	and maybe even during next month
2015-11-08 12:25:49	mont29	Anyway, I think we all have own projects (2.8-ish ones) we can work on already :)
2015-11-08 12:26:05	mont29	2.8 branch would just be a way to 'officially' start it
2015-11-08 12:26:26	Severin	agree
2015-11-08 12:26:26	kaito	i prefer to only make it when we agree on what happens there
2015-11-08 12:26:36	mont29	sounds reasonable :)
2015-11-08 12:26:49	kaito	and when there's a strong lead and organization in place to coordinate the efforts
2015-11-08 12:26:55	scorpion81	and if one project depends on one or more ? should there be some cooperation then maybe ? so at the end all fits together nicely ?
2015-11-08 12:27:21	levon_	would it be a good start to start a 2.8 branch, and have people start adding the projects they want to work on in dev.blender as tasks? to get an idea of what people want to work on, so people can collaborate, and no double handling?
2015-11-08 12:27:28	Severin	scorpion81, therefore we have the new dependency graph
2015-11-08 12:27:30	Severin	;)
2015-11-08 12:27:50	scorpion81	we need a project dependency graph...
2015-11-08 12:28:00	kaito	levon_: that sounds far too random
2015-11-08 12:28:04	levon_	ok
2015-11-08 12:28:32	ideasman42	levon_, misc projects happen anyway
2015-11-08 12:28:32	kaito	Who people, who decides on what? how to decide?
2015-11-08 12:28:43	zeauro	Should patch tracker have tags 2.7/2.8 ?
2015-11-08 12:28:45	ideasman42	and can be done in own branches or patches
2015-11-08 12:28:49	kaito	1 person removes sequencer, other adds it back? ;)
2015-11-08 12:29:34	kaito	i think we have to get this sorted out all well.
2015-11-08 12:29:38	ideasman42	am wary of pushing too much into 2.8
2015-11-08 12:29:59	ideasman42	we should include larger projects - but other projects can happen in branches as they do now
2015-11-08 12:30:09	kaito	we can also just move huge parts of blender unaltered over to 2.8 and work on it there in small steps
2015-11-08 12:30:26	kaito	but i rather see that agreed on first then
2015-11-08 12:30:46	scorpion81	hmmm @ small vs big steps....
2015-11-08 12:30:57	kaito	the main questions are: who would work on what, would there be new funding in? hiring full timers?
2015-11-08 12:31:30	JuxTApoze	new modules page ;p
2015-11-08 12:31:31	kaito	if i look at my own planning, i dont see things really start before march or so
2015-11-08 12:32:01	kaito	(start as in - have 2.8 branch and big picture docs agreed)
2015-11-08 12:32:18	povmaniac	i am very tired of working alone in my projects,, maybe is time for collaborate with others
2015-11-08 12:32:31	forest-house	Will there be a kickstarter funding?
2015-11-08 12:32:47	scorpion81	so if everyone makes their own branches then, how can be assured everything fits together at the end ? shouldnt there be a masterplan before those projects start off ?

2015-11-08 12:35:16	kaito	that gives us time to discuss openly and try ideas without having to argue or to stress out

2015-11-08 12:35:58	ideasman42	JuxTApoze, think this is quite different kind of project to 2.5x
2015-11-08 12:36:03	Severin	agree, but would be nice to have an overview of open questions
2015-11-08 12:36:07	*	JuxTApoze nods @ ideasman42
2015-11-08 12:36:16	JuxTApoze	but still, wisdom from the past helps
2015-11-08 12:36:32	kaito	Severin: that's true. a wiki 2.8 section is a good start
2015-11-08 12:36:36	ideasman42	Then we had non-working ui - job was hooking up event system / rna / operators / pyapi
2015-11-08 12:36:42	Severin	kaito, +1
2015-11-08 12:36:48	scorpion81	well, for example i would continuing maintaining the FM Branch as long as its necessary and when it will fit to the new design then
2015-11-08 12:37:18	ideasman42	now its more large individual projects afaics
2015-11-08 12:38:00	kaito	viewport and node stuff are going to be very big and intrusive for UI and workflow
2015-11-08 12:38:17	kaito	i think these two have the biggest question marks with open deisgn issues
2015-11-08 12:38:20	ideasman42	but having new viewport wont break filesel or mean recoding fcurve ui
2015-11-08 12:38:52	kaito	not that part, but it does affect model tools and sculpt and 3d paint and GE and shaders and nodes and and
2015-11-08 12:38:52	JuxTApoze	Severin and ideasman42 : the todo page where unsolvable design issues were being moved to from the bug tracker is a good section to have addressed in the overview of open questions.
2015-11-08 12:38:56	merwin	git question: for 2.8-targeted branches, does it matter if we branch from master vs. from 2.8-master? for later integration
2015-11-08 12:39:31	*	JuxTApoze spins the squeaky wheel once again on addressing core design issues that are roadblocks to further design in 2.7x
2015-11-08 12:40:02	Juicyphone	Think we should make 2.8 the focus of as many devs as possible early on
2015-11-08 12:40:45	Juicyphone	JuxTApoze that is also why the list is important

2015-11-08 12:41:24	Severin	JuxTApoze, oh yeah, updating and keeping an eye (or two) on the todo list is important for 2.8 IMHO

2015-11-08 13:39:15	RobM_71	the problem is, if you're core-limited, there's only so much you can do to speed it up.

LLVM targeting OpenMP and OpenCL and CUDA... that work could have gone into improving MESA)
2015-11-08 13:39:34	kaito	one of reasons for recode is to drop legacy systems. the minimum standard will be a "decent workstation in 2010"

2015-11-08 13:59:20	forest-house	Would it make sense to improve the work beteween the compositor and the sequencer? More then one composite output should be allowed. And then stack them in the VSE.

2015-11-08 14:15:21	kaito	if people like to edit nodes for effect strips, that is fine
2015-11-08 14:15:50	kaito	but the compositor in blender is for frames from render engines, using multiple passes, (deep buffers, etc) to manage render systems and make a shot
2015-11-08 14:16:11	kaito	compositor pipeline means that 1 image should be 'fast' but can take seconds to minutes to complete
2015-11-08 14:16:35	forest-house	I do the shots in the compositor. 1 shot 1 blend file. Render them out and cut them together in the vse. Encoding in ffmpeg, not blender.
2015-11-08 14:16:45	kaito	compositing you do as part of render on farms, then send to sequencer for further processing
2015-11-08 14:17:20	JtheNinja	i've never liked that workflow though, you have to redo the render if you want to change comp
2015-11-08 14:17:37	JtheNinja	that defeats half the point of comp
2015-11-08 14:17:59	kaito	that depends on what kind of sw you use
2015-11-08 14:18:01	forest-house	Of course its always about the workflow. In After Effects I can make Comps and insert them in other Comps.

2015-11-26 16:47:22		[ http://is.gd/nbgf0E ]
