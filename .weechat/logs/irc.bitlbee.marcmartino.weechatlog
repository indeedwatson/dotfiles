2016-01-21 13:34:01	yama	nice
2016-01-21 13:34:07	MarcMartino	i'd have to imagine that a house in .ar is cheaper than that
2016-01-21 13:34:16	MarcMartino	i'm not bragging- this sucks
2016-01-21 13:34:23	MarcMartino	in calli it would likely be twice as much
2016-01-21 13:34:40	yama	i've no clue on house sizes but it depends a lot on location and size
2016-01-21 13:35:33	MarcMartino	what's a good entry level, middle class house cost?

2016-01-21 13:42:34	MarcMartino	i like sleeping on the floor
2016-01-21 13:42:40	MarcMartino	yoga mat no pillow
2016-01-21 13:42:44	MarcMartino	the best
2016-01-21 13:42:47	yama	is that a new meme

2016-01-21 13:44:02	yama	y
2016-01-21 13:44:37	MarcMartino	because sleeping on your back is the most natural as far as i can tell
2016-01-21 13:44:53	MarcMartino	and if you sleep on your back then a pillow just fucks up your posture
2016-01-21 13:45:01	yama	pooping in the woods in a hole is more natural than a toilet
2016-01-21 13:45:21	MarcMartino	eh i use a squatty potty

2016-01-28 19:05:02	yama	wat
2016-01-28 19:05:26	MarcMartino	i guess it's just different from the equivalent weight room goal

2016-01-28 19:12:56	yama	im talking hspu
2016-01-28 19:13:00	MarcMartino	ofc you can be too weak to hs and it would be a strength goal, but that's a low bar
2016-01-28 19:13:09	MarcMartino	look how many women are posting in hs anon
2016-01-28 19:13:23	yama	what is that
2016-01-28 19:13:26	MarcMartino	if most women can do it, it's not very strength taxing

2016-01-28 22:22:47	MarcMartino	i've had my own reasons not to work out
2016-01-28 22:23:04	MarcMartino	of course everything we do devolves into self motivation
2016-01-28 22:23:41	yama	because being stronger makes moving around easier
2016-01-28 22:23:51	yama	and makes me feel less tired from physical activity
2016-01-28 22:23:51	MarcMartino	not really though
2016-01-28 22:24:00	MarcMartino	maybe it's different in .ar
2016-01-28 22:24:06	yama	wut
2016-01-28 22:24:17	MarcMartino	but in .us everything is made for the lowest common denominator
2016-01-28 22:24:38	yama	how does that apply to lifting a box or walking up the stairs
2016-01-28 22:24:42	yama	or helping a friend move
2016-01-28 22:25:24	MarcMartino	ramps/elevators are legally mandatory in the .us
2016-01-28 22:25:37	MarcMartino	stairs are almost entirely optional
2016-01-28 22:25:44	MarcMartino	also moving companies are the standard
2016-01-28 22:25:47	MarcMartino	you see
2016-01-28 22:26:08	yama	well get a poor friend
2016-01-28 22:26:10	MarcMartino	of course i'm not a lard ass, i take stairs and move my own boxes but that's really optional here
2016-01-28 22:26:35	yama	my friend moved a few months ago, with a moving company, still had to help him carry furniture up 3 flights of stairs
2016-01-28 22:26:42	MarcMartino	nice
2016-01-28 22:27:51	MarcMartino	working out is a hell of a time and mental commitment to make it slightly easier to move houses a hand full of times in a lifetime though
2016-01-28 22:28:15	MarcMartino	i'm playing devil's advocate
2016-01-28 22:28:17	yama	6 hours a week
2016-01-28 22:28:18	MarcMartino	i agree with you
2016-01-28 22:28:20	yama	aint that much
2016-01-28 22:28:22	MarcMartino	enough silliness
2016-01-28 22:28:36	MarcMartino	my expensive pants came
2016-01-28 22:28:43	MarcMartino	and they are the wrong color
2016-01-28 22:28:45	yama	but you know it's not just noticeable when moving objects, just moving normally is easier

2016-02-09 21:28:08	yama	what does the code do
2016-02-09 21:28:17	MarcMartino	js is the most widely used brogramming language that exists today
2016-02-09 21:28:32	MarcMartino	it's for properly seeding a kmeans clustering algorithm
2016-02-09 21:28:45	MarcMartino	so that the clustering is more accurate and efficient
2016-02-09 21:30:15	MarcMartino	picks the first centroid at random, then picks each subsequent centroid using a probabilistic distribution based on the data point's nearest centroid
2016-02-09 21:37:51	yama	i don't tihnk i'd learn js if i learned programming
2016-02-09 21:38:00	yama	probably python or c something

2016-02-16 21:58:24	MarcMartino	something low carb
2016-02-16 21:58:40	yama	would be awkward to eat

2016-02-16 21:59:48	yama	and a piece of cake maybe
2016-02-16 21:59:49	MarcMartino	a nice salad

2016-02-16 22:01:02	yama	fresh
2016-02-16 22:01:17	MarcMartino	just keep the dressing seperate

2016-02-16 22:02:02	MarcMartino	it's probably easier than cutting calories further

2016-02-23 10:46:13	yama	in season 2 it's about a guy who walked away from his outpost in afghanistan

2016-03-01 22:28:14	MarcMartino	no he hates fitness or moving
2016-03-01 22:28:17	MarcMartino	or eating well
2016-03-01 22:28:19	yama	lol
2016-03-01 22:28:38	MarcMartino	we're exact opposite
2016-03-01 22:28:40	yama	sounds like a stoner movie in the making
2016-03-01 22:28:56	MarcMartino	only similarities is that i taught him to like metal when we were kids
2016-03-01 22:29:05	yama	poor him
2016-03-01 22:29:44	MarcMartino	nah metal has been great for him
2016-03-01 22:29:49	MarcMartino	he used to book shows for vegas
2016-03-01 22:29:57	MarcMartino	talk to all the bands and orchestrate things
2016-03-01 22:30:07	yama	interesting
2016-03-01 22:30:08	MarcMartino	i was really proud of him for the work he did there
2016-03-01 22:30:16	yama	do you like radiohead
2016-03-01 22:30:39	MarcMartino	they are okay
2016-03-01 22:31:23	MarcMartino	why do you ask
2016-03-01 22:32:54	yama	because i tried to like them
2016-03-01 22:32:56	yama	i feel i should

2016-03-01 22:41:32	MarcMartino	meh listen to what you enjoy
2016-03-01 22:41:40	MarcMartino	even if it's snobby music'
2016-03-01 22:44:32	yama	i go out of my way to listen to different music often, some takes a while before you can get enjoyment out of it
2016-03-01 22:44:50	yama	because more complex works require more time for familiarity
2016-03-01 22:45:16	MarcMartino	This makes logical sense to me
2016-03-01 22:47:38	yama	the one i mentioned for example, has an odd rhythm, and later the percussion enters and gives the rhythm a new context https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2VzLn6DMCE

2016-03-06 15:36:53	MarcMartino	yeah but my dough isn't stretchy like his
2016-03-06 15:37:33	yama	when you did it, did the bottom stick slightly to the counter?
2016-03-06 15:37:55	yama	the point of doing that is to stretch the surface of the dough
2016-03-06 15:38:20	MarcMartino	Not really
2016-03-06 15:40:15	yama	maybe it's cause it's plastic or there was too much flour

2016-03-06 15:41:25	yama	yeah that bit should be done on a part of the counter without flour
2016-03-06 15:41:33	yama	yes his is much higher hydration

2016-03-07 02:17:57	MarcMartino	i would like to try and make thinner next time
2016-03-07 02:18:11	yama	that's just a general master dough
2016-03-07 02:18:13	MarcMartino	is funny because you mentioned that it looked like i had stretched it a bit thin

2016-03-07 02:18:39	MarcMartino	but it still came out more like a Sicilian pizza than i prefer
2016-03-07 02:19:16	yama	did you take a pic of the crust?
2016-03-07 02:19:45	MarcMartino	* Non-Displayable Attachments *
2016-03-07 02:20:00	MarcMartino	* Non-Displayable Attachments *
2016-03-07 02:20:28	MarcMartino	tbf i overcooked the crust a bit, i shouldn't have let the bottom get quite that brown before cheesing
2016-03-07 02:20:39	MarcMartino	the one later this week will be better
2016-03-07 02:20:45	MarcMartino	i need moar cheese tho

2016-03-07 02:22:08	MarcMartino	okay will do
2016-03-07 02:22:33	MarcMartino	it was hard to stretch until i realised i had to press it out first
2016-03-07 02:22:36	MarcMartino	then no it was easy
2016-03-07 02:22:44	MarcMartino	i think i even stretched it fairly evenly
2016-03-07 02:23:31	MarcMartino	yeah i don't want to be cracker like, but thinner would be more my preference
2016-03-07 02:23:49	MarcMartino	i'm glad i get a second crack at it
2016-03-07 02:24:27	MarcMartino	well later this week i get an easy crack at it
2016-03-07 02:25:08	MarcMartino	the sauce i used was a tad too sweet for my tastes too
2016-03-07 02:25:11	MarcMartino	i think
2016-03-07 02:25:26	MarcMartino	i might try using a pasta sauce instead of pizza sauce
2016-03-07 02:25:43	MarcMartino	what's the big difference in the doughs

2016-03-07 15:27:47	yama	don't think so

2016-03-07 15:54:11	MarcMartino	don't think i've played any ff past 4 :P
2016-03-07 15:54:16	yama	i'm pretty much over jrpgs
2016-03-07 15:54:35	yama	it's weird that you don't like videogames except for very long and slow rpgs :p
2016-03-07 15:55:06	MarcMartino	yeah but long slow rpgs are like crack for someone interested in self improvement
2016-03-07 15:55:25	yama	more like sugar cubes
2016-03-07 15:55:27	yama	placebo
2016-03-07 15:55:29	MarcMartino	i used to have like 5 maxed out characters in world of warcraft
2016-03-07 15:55:32	MarcMartino	exactly
2016-03-07 15:55:36	MarcMartino	that's why i stopped
2016-03-07 15:55:42	yama	cause it's one of those games where you actually don't improve much, your characters do
2016-03-07 15:55:52	MarcMartino	exactly
2016-03-07 15:56:00	MarcMartino	it's like engineered meth
2016-03-07 15:56:04	yama	why not play something where you do improve tho?
2016-03-07 15:56:08	MarcMartino	it's not good for you but it feels great

2016-03-07 15:56:17	MarcMartino	like what
2016-03-07 15:56:27	MarcMartino	i can't think of a game that improves you more than the placebo
2016-03-07 15:56:35	yama	what do you mean
2016-03-07 15:56:49	yama	if you play tetris and you get good at it, YOU got good at it, not your avatar
2016-03-07 15:57:06	yama	if you play CSGO and you improve your aim, you improved your eye-hand coordination
2016-03-07 15:57:32	MarcMartino	yeah but i'm not convinced that you're improving "more than placebo"
2016-03-07 15:57:41	yama	wut
2016-03-07 15:57:48	yama	that makes no logical sense
2016-03-07 15:57:59	MarcMartino	yeah it does bear with me i'm at work
2016-03-07 15:58:03	yama	if you have better aim, you can measure objectively your improvement
2016-03-07 15:58:13	yama	if i play a racing game
2016-03-07 15:58:15	yama	or do a speedrun
2016-03-07 15:58:20	yama	and i get a pb
2016-03-07 15:58:25	yama	and tomorrow i get a better pb
2016-03-07 15:58:28	yama	i was faster
2016-03-07 15:58:42	yama	it is literally the same as any sport
2016-03-07 15:58:45	MarcMartino	yeah but the amount of improvement to your life that dominating at tetris might be an 11
2016-03-07 15:59:17	yama	how is that relevant?
2016-03-07 15:59:23	yama	that doesn't make it placebo, it's different things
2016-03-07 15:59:51	MarcMartino	but the amount of improvement you would get by spending the time doing another average activity might be 10-15 units of growth
2016-03-07 16:00:13	MarcMartino	in that case tetris is not statistically significant over placebo
2016-03-07 16:00:29	yama	that applies just as well to bjj or pretty much anything
2016-03-07 16:00:32	MarcMartino	do you get the general idea
2016-03-07 16:00:42	MarcMartino	for sure
2016-03-07 16:00:45	MarcMartino	it's subjective
2016-03-07 16:00:51	yama	yes but it makes no practical or realistic sense
2016-03-07 16:00:53	MarcMartino	that's why i'm using unit units
2016-03-07 16:01:18	yama	maybe i could get really good at throwing a frisbee in the same time but i dont give a shit about frisbees
2016-03-07 16:01:38	yama	so 200 units of improvement on frisbee are worse than 2 units of improvement on tetris cause i like tetris more

2016-03-07 16:02:57	MarcMartino	well yeah this is true, personal enjoyment should be one parameter in the equation for determining the improvement units. not the only one however. maybe not the main one even
2016-03-07 16:04:48	MarcMartino	imo
2016-03-07 16:04:51	yama	so if it's not the only or main factor, what is the determining factor that makes it logical for you to spend time fapping everyday
2016-03-07 16:05:17	MarcMartino	it makes the rest of my day more productive
2016-03-07 16:05:28	MarcMartino	hence it's an effective time
2016-03-07 16:05:45	yama	only in the same way that smoking makes you more calm if you're addicted to it, imo
2016-03-07 16:06:08	MarcMartino	but i'm not a sadist, i'm allowed to use a small portion of my time for non productive thing. i don't need to be studying math and power lifting every hour of every day
2016-03-07 16:06:44	MarcMartino	it's just a lens through which i decide how to spend my time
2016-03-07 16:08:29	MarcMartino	going the other way is clearly not the way i'd like to live my life
2016-03-07 16:08:36	MarcMartino	doing only what feels good at the moment
2016-03-07 16:08:44	MarcMartino	never building myself up for something more

2016-03-10 14:54:38	yama	i'll try for the next thing i can come up with that i want to do
2016-03-10 14:55:06	MarcMartino	get channel from list of most watched channels
2016-03-10 14:55:21	MarcMartino	Is this actually fetching the most watched channels list
2016-03-10 14:55:31	MarcMartino	It looks like for static options
2016-03-10 14:55:38	yama	no
2016-03-10 14:55:45	yama	i manually enter them
2016-03-10 14:55:52	MarcMartino	Four
2016-03-10 14:55:54	yama	wasn't sure how to word it
2016-03-10 14:55:56	MarcMartino	Ah nice
2016-03-10 14:56:38	MarcMartino	What does case "${2:-b}" do
2016-03-10 14:56:50	yama	i also added an alias in .bashrc so if i just type ohn it will execute "twitch ohn" which will open outerheaven
2016-03-10 14:57:31	yama	$2 is input, and the -b is the default, so if i input l or m it goes to low or medium, but if i leave it empty it defaults to best quality
2016-03-10 14:58:20	yama	i was trying to explain what i wanted in #bash earlier and i wanted to make a graphic explaining the flow, do you know if there's sites to do that?
2016-03-10 14:59:11	MarcMartino	Yeah look for mind map
2016-03-10 14:59:32	MarcMartino	Or there's something specifically for brogramming
2016-03-10 15:00:51	yama	ye that's what i want
2016-03-10 15:00:55	yama	something quick
2016-03-10 15:01:10	yama	like to share a gist or a pastebin but of a graph like that

2016-03-10 18:33:41	MarcMartino	i pull the arm across to get advantageous position (his shoulders/hips pointed away from me, mine pointed towards him) and then i push him to get him reacting and delivering energy back into me. then i dip under his center of gravity

2016-03-10 18:48:44	MarcMartino	you should automate 1 thing every week
2016-03-10 18:48:49	MarcMartino	or two things a week
2016-03-10 18:48:57	MarcMartino	i think that's cool af

2016-03-10 18:50:17	yama	should i try to do the bash script in python as an exercise?
2016-03-10 18:50:23	MarcMartino	yes do it now
2016-03-10 18:50:29	MarcMartino	and i'll code review

2016-03-10 18:50:42	MarcMartino	okay cool
2016-03-10 18:50:49	yama	do you often brogram with podcasts or shit? or too distracting?
2016-03-10 18:51:12	MarcMartino	yep podcasts or music or silence or just ambient coffee shop noise
2016-03-10 18:51:25	yama	you are literally srraven
2016-03-10 18:51:38	MarcMartino	sometimes when i'm in the coffee shop i use my headphones with the noise cancelling but with no sound going through them
2016-03-10 18:51:45	MarcMartino	just to quiet the ambient noise a bit
2016-03-10 18:51:48	MarcMartino	it's nice

2016-03-10 18:52:01	yama	he was talking about coffee shop ambient noise
2016-03-10 18:52:03	MarcMartino	not a nice comparison
2016-03-10 18:52:26	yama	for a second i thought you were gonna say you go to coffee shops with noise cancelling headphones while listening to coffee shop ambient sound
2016-03-10 18:52:48	MarcMartino	haha that would be dope
2016-03-10 18:53:03	MarcMartino	once in a while i listen to rain sounds
2016-03-10 18:53:07	MarcMartino	i should do that more
2016-03-10 18:53:21	MarcMartino	i esp like that when it's raining outside my window at work
2016-03-10 18:53:21	yama	did you listen to the NYC binaural video i posted a few weeks back?
2016-03-10 18:53:27	MarcMartino	no i didn't

2016-03-10 19:04:52	MarcMartino	pls try to say something really condescending right now
2016-03-10 19:05:01	MarcMartino	also something where you need to focus
2016-03-10 19:05:08	MarcMartino	not browsing porn
2016-03-10 19:05:16	yama	if i need to focus i'd probably not listen to anything
2016-03-10 19:05:19	MarcMartino	or readign the m4m listings
2016-03-10 19:05:23	yama	lol
2016-03-10 19:05:42	yama	i'll try to do the python thing with one of adam's videos in the background now
2016-03-10 19:05:54	MarcMartino	cool
2016-03-10 19:06:38	MarcMartino	i code to joe rogan's podcast often

2016-03-10 19:21:36	MarcMartino	what are you missing
2016-03-10 19:23:50	yama	just basic syntax that i'm not sure i'm doing right

2016-03-10 19:28:41	MarcMartino	just fix whatever the interpreter tells you is wrong
2016-03-10 19:28:57	yama	im with the exercise from the other time now
2016-03-10 19:29:02	yama	using elif
2016-03-10 19:29:11	MarcMartino	elif?
2016-03-10 19:29:14	yama	but it gives error if i don't input a number
2016-03-10 19:29:23	yama	ye i gave you a gist and you told me to use else if
2016-03-10 19:29:35	MarcMartino	oh yeah
2016-03-10 19:31:24	yama	there's an example in the book which is pretty much identical

2016-03-10 19:45:30	yama	i pressed f for that example btw
2016-03-10 19:45:30	MarcMartino	it is trying to interpret whatever is coming in from the input function
2016-03-10 19:45:34	MarcMartino	numbers work well
2016-03-10 19:45:41	yama	it happens if it's a string i think
2016-03-10 19:45:41	MarcMartino	but strings are evaluated
2016-03-10 19:45:59	MarcMartino	i tried typecasting to int, but it didn't give a fuck
2016-03-10 19:46:14	yama	what does that mean
2016-03-10 19:47:17	MarcMartino	it still errored for me
2016-03-10 19:47:26	MarcMartino	it means we aren't understanding the input function
2016-03-10 19:49:04	yama	https://trinket.io/python3/5cfe45b0f7 why does this one work then

2016-03-10 19:52:37	MarcMartino	this makes sense
2016-03-10 19:52:44	MarcMartino	input is trying to evaluate the text
2016-03-10 19:52:47	MarcMartino	not just pass it through
2016-03-10 19:52:50	yama	dope
2016-03-10 19:53:06	yama	i remember using raw input when i was doing tuts last years
2016-03-10 19:53:13	yama	seems i forgot all of it
2016-03-10 19:53:13	MarcMartino	haha though that bashes your cases
2016-03-10 19:53:18	yama	:(
2016-03-10 19:53:39	MarcMartino	you might need to do something to the comparisons because '1' == 1 could easily eval to false
2016-03-10 19:54:23	yama	o
2016-03-10 19:54:25	yama	that's true
2016-03-10 19:54:29	yama	but
2016-03-10 19:54:36	yama	the book did not explain this i think

2016-03-10 19:57:52	MarcMartino	if you wrap raw_input() in an int() call then the cases work aggain
2016-03-10 19:58:03	MarcMartino	but it yells at you if it can't convert to an int
2016-03-10 19:58:07	MarcMartino	so strings are angry again
2016-03-10 19:58:17	yama	lol
2016-03-10 19:58:39	yama	i don't feel the exercise expected you to figure out all this
2016-03-10 19:59:01	yama	because the previous example was just with strings

2016-03-10 20:30:13	yama	i laughed at the video cause it felt like memes
2016-03-10 20:30:32	MarcMartino	because he shot to the top of the sport in only a tiny amount of time because he's really good and talks so much shit
2016-03-10 20:30:50	MarcMartino	so now that he finally had a loss he's getting just pounded down
2016-03-10 20:30:55	yama	hah
2016-03-10 20:31:06	yama	he reminds me of srraven for some reason
2016-03-10 20:31:12	yama	probably beard and looking like a dick
2016-03-10 20:31:19	MarcMartino	everyone you don't like reminds you of srraven

2016-03-10 20:32:12	MarcMartino	mcgregor is just trying to get his paychecks
2016-03-10 20:32:17	MarcMartino	talking is how you do it

2016-03-10 20:32:48	MarcMartino	people just like to see the hype train derailed
2016-03-10 20:33:13	yama	from my expert opinion based on 1 video and 1 gif, he looks like he has no sense of humor
2016-03-10 20:33:41	MarcMartino	he totally does though
2016-03-10 20:34:34	yama	how old is he

2016-03-10 20:35:23	yama	he looks way older
2016-03-10 20:35:32	MarcMartino	he has a great laugh
2016-03-10 20:35:35	yama	if they ever make a movie about him he should be played by tom hardy
2016-03-10 20:35:47	MarcMartino	look at this interview from cnbc, the money channel
2016-03-10 20:35:53	yama	oh wait tom hardy was in a mma movie
2016-03-10 20:36:40	MarcMartino	yeah
2016-03-10 20:36:49	MarcMartino	the warrior was quite bad though
2016-03-10 20:36:53	yama	have you seen it?
2016-03-10 20:36:58	MarcMartino	ye
2016-03-10 20:37:10	MarcMartino	when it first came out
2016-03-10 20:37:46	yama	The Fighter was good but idk what style of fighting that was about
2016-03-10 20:40:05	MarcMartino	You do realize bjj !== mma right?
2016-03-10 20:40:23	yama	yes
2016-03-10 20:40:56	yama	but that's as far as i go
2016-03-10 20:41:10	yama	like you with bach writing symphonies
2016-03-10 20:41:27	MarcMartino	The best bjj guys don't even get paid
2016-03-10 20:41:37	MarcMartino	No one gives a fuck about bjj
2016-03-10 20:41:57	MarcMartino	There are certainly no big movies in the subject

2016-03-10 20:43:24	MarcMartino	Out with it bitch
2016-03-10 20:44:58	yama	the symphonic form as we know it didn't really exist at Bach's time. He wrote some pieces called sinfonias which are just small 3-voice inventions that don't ressemble what would be later called a symphony at all

2016-03-12 12:36:09	MarcMartino	it doesn't mean you're fatter, it doesn't mean you're skinnier
2016-03-12 12:36:22	yama	then what is it good for
2016-03-12 12:36:34	MarcMartino	-_-
2016-03-12 12:36:44	MarcMartino	it's good for seeing the trends over time
2016-03-12 12:37:00	yama	all it means is i took the measurement 3mm more to the right than last time

2016-03-12 12:38:50	MarcMartino	bf measurement is always going to be like that because you're measuring it indirectlyl
2016-03-12 12:40:40	yama	well i guess it reflects the same trend as the shitty scale
2016-03-12 12:40:43	yama	no change

2016-03-13 21:20:19	MarcMartino	his head is way out in front of his body
2016-03-13 21:20:30	MarcMartino	and the lighting definitely doesn't help
2016-03-13 21:20:39	MarcMartino	i wonder if they asked him to speak older
2016-03-13 21:20:44	yama	it has very hard lighting, it's weird
2016-03-13 21:20:57	yama	it probably contributes to making things feel awkward
