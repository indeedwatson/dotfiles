2016-01-10 22:42:48	tsarn	This game should have lasted 10 minutes. The schtick isn't good enough to carry it this long
2016-01-10 22:42:52	realrobrose	This game is gonna end with you like.. having to make a new game or something meta like that

2016-01-10 22:45:46	tiberius_kirk	Zekohl I feel like it's trying to make a point, using dry humor to engage the audience, but never really understanding that humor so it just gets drier and drier
2016-01-10 22:45:47	realrobrose	I'd rather be watching people play Her Story
2016-01-10 22:45:48	horatio_svetlana	@Previouslyrecorded_live Mad Max Fury Road is a frontrunner for best picture, it's not going to win. Because Star Wars lost to Annie Hall. Talk about how bullshit the Oscars are.

2016-01-10 23:09:11	shadix20	Is this like a My Little Pony fan game that gets unreasonably symbolic?

2016-01-10 23:10:15	shadix20	@Captain_nitpick Seems like we're reaching pretentious levels of religious symbolism.
2016-01-10 23:10:23	this_time_its_lupus	@Previouslyrecorded_live just worry about surviving when Satan comes for you, not shooting him.
2016-01-10 23:10:31	muldoonite	@Previouslyrecorded_live, is it super cold in wisconsin?

2016-01-10 23:10:44	captain_nitpick	@Shadix20 oh, certainly. But it's not a My Little Pony game. It just has ponies.
2016-01-10 23:10:44	mr_glitch	@Dickneutral They charge an extra fee to not stick you with a serial killer, so Satan drving for Uber seems like par for the course.
2016-01-10 23:10:51	too_much_nukie	@Shadix20 This is using religion for comedy, and has nothing to do with My Little Pony.
2016-01-10 23:11:02	shadix20	@Captain_nitpick Fair enough.
2016-01-10 23:11:08	lifeuhfindsaway	Have jack and rich weighed in on Steven Avery's innocence yet?

2016-01-10 23:11:31	shadix20	@Too_much_nukie I dunno, some parts seem too serious to just pass it off as pure comedy.
2016-01-10 23:11:34	beermeister2089	It actually snowed in Indiana. First time this year.
2016-01-10 23:11:34	tearbotheyesout	Had a lot of hype for an ice storm in Michigan that turned out to be nothing

2016-01-10 23:16:08	tiberius_kirk	wow, that was the uninspiring way to meta it up its own ass
2016-01-10 23:16:08	xyrion8	are you guys gonna play the witcher 3?

2016-01-10 23:16:19	movieboozerbill	I can't fault him for that.
2016-01-10 23:16:24	hellcopter	@Porksub, This game started development before undertale. Just a funny convergence of themes lol
2016-01-10 23:16:26	solidbaked	Imaghostol If that was a knockoff,it was a pretty good one,like RC cola.
2016-01-10 23:16:28	sharkspeare_	@Previouslyrecorded_live now you must finish off his cohort... dickneutral

2016-01-10 23:16:38	atomicmousetrap	It's a lot more like Eversion than Undertale. This isn't a new concept.
2016-01-10 23:16:40	bosredsox24	@Solidbaked
2016-01-10 23:16:41	shadix20	It should've replace the shortcut on the desktop with an Uninstall.exe.
2016-01-10 23:16:41	ivanly_streams	undertale is far from the first meta game
2016-01-10 23:16:42	mr_glitch	That sure was,..

2016-01-10 23:17:14	ivanly_streams	i tried playing CK2 and I could never really figure out what I was doing

2016-01-10 23:43:30	jugga93	@dickneutral I would blow the game's creator, Jonathan Blow, because Braid was so good
2016-01-10 23:43:34	synnerman	I have the film on Blu-ray, but I would need an alert when the VHS stuff is over.

2016-01-10 23:47:11	drazzen_ilesere	I wonder how they did that, that was pretty damn good coding.
2016-01-10 23:47:12	too_much_nukie	@Captain_nitpick Good point Captain_Nitpick.
2016-01-10 23:47:32	tiberius_kirk	Drazzen_ilesere I suspect they chose a steam friend the game could see was online
2016-01-10 23:47:35	synnerman	Wow, the Blu-ray for "The Dirt Bike Kid" even has an audio commentary by the director.
2016-01-10 23:47:44	tiberius_kirk	there's a director to this?
2016-01-10 23:47:47	dickneutral	@Tiberius_Kirk, I'm not even signed into steam
2016-01-10 23:47:49	tiberius_kirk	WHO WOULD ADMIT TO THIS FILM?
2016-01-10 23:47:52	tiberius_kirk	Dickneutral oh shit!
2016-01-10 23:47:58	synnerman	It was his only film
2016-01-10 23:47:59	drazzen_ilesere	I've never seen it, is it garbage?
2016-01-10 23:48:04	mostlikelyabot	It turns out that it wasn't really the game, and DickNeutral was clever enough to fuck with Rich and Jack stealthily
2016-01-10 23:48:18	too_much_nukie	Imagine playing Pony Island while talking to a friend and they pick that friend to distract you. That'd be great.
2016-01-10 23:48:25	comixian120	@Tiberius_kirk what about http://putlocker.is/watch-the-thing-online-free-putlocker.html

2016-01-10 23:48:31	drazzen_ilesere	it was great that they were playing the game and it was on stream
2016-01-10 23:48:32	tiberius_kirk	what about it, com?
2016-01-10 23:48:41	synnerman	The director's only movie is "The Dirt Bike Kid"
2016-01-10 23:48:45	show_you_my_wendys_ad	Is that one of the influences behind TurboKid? I watched it on Jay's rec, but it kind of sucked I thought
2016-01-10 23:48:46	comixian120	omg nevermind
2016-01-10 23:48:47	drazzen_ilesere	I mean that's a throwaway game Jack would have played on his own

2016-01-11 00:42:32	oh_bother	he's on a 911?
2016-01-11 00:42:44	too_much_nukie	There's nobody to root for here. The bank is clearly in the right but the boss tried to rape one lady and probably blackmail another.
2016-01-11 00:42:50	tiberius_kirk	Them Duke boys are gonna be in a heap o' trouble!

2016-01-11 00:44:16	banefieldeth	Nobody notices the flying child.
2016-01-11 00:44:18	wadcutter71	this totally reminds me of that scene in Bladerunner
2016-01-11 00:44:19	oh_bother	kid is going to the red light district
