2015-10-22 23:26:23	JudyFong	Is that a fourth book? I thought there were only 3.
2015-10-22 23:26:58	yama	there's like 6 and more written by his son

2015-10-22 23:27:48	JudyFong	As long as the first 6 were written by him, I'll read them. I don't like it too much when other authors continue a series. It doesn't read as well.
2015-10-22 23:27:55	JudyFong	How fast do you read Dune books?
2015-10-22 23:39:43	yama	I was really hooked on the first one but I'm not sure how fast I read it
2015-10-22 23:39:52	yama	I'll let you know when I start God Emperor
2015-10-22 23:40:02	yama	after I finish Neuromancer with potentia
2015-10-23 01:30:08	JudyFong	OK. Just let me know how the first like 5 sections go.
2015-10-23 01:30:15	JudyFong	That should be a good baseline.
