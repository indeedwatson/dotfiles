2015-10-22 18:45:03	indeedwatson	im reading the pizza bible
2015-10-22 18:45:58	tomflint	sweet. I haven't read very much of it yet 
2015-10-22 18:46:13	tomflint	it seems to be really popular 
2015-10-22 18:46:30	tomflint	that guy is a world champion dough-acrobat or something 
2015-10-22 18:46:44	indeedwatson	i was gonna make a dough starter, but i only have instant yeast and he has said against it

2015-10-22 18:48:52	indeedwatson	haha
2015-10-22 18:49:08	indeedwatson	he's certainly a showman
2015-10-22 18:49:25	tomflint	he makes an ultra salty dough for that -- its inedible 
2015-10-22 18:49:41	tomflint	and he always insists on throwing them at people, which is weird
2015-10-22 18:49:42	indeedwatson	yeah i watched the video you linked 
2015-10-22 18:50:21	tomflint	nobody wants dough thrown at them
2015-10-22 18:51:12	indeedwatson	do you have a mixer
2015-10-22 18:54:13	tomflint	I have a food processor --
2015-10-22 18:54:19	tomflint	its a crazy one though 
2015-10-22 18:54:23	tomflint	1.5hp! haah

2015-10-22 18:55:17	tomflint	they're about $600 stateside 
2015-10-22 18:56:17	indeedwatson	damn
2015-10-22 18:56:24	indeedwatson	i'll keep handmixing :p
2015-10-22 18:56:25	tomflint	its overkill for most people 
2015-10-22 18:57:42	tomflint	there are less expensive ones. Its nice because you can get about 10 minutes worth of hand kneading in a fraction of the time 
2015-10-22 19:00:04	indeedwatson	well i need a scale first
2015-10-22 19:00:08	indeedwatson	and maybe a thermometer
2015-10-22 19:00:24	tomflint	a scale is good to have 
2015-10-22 19:00:27	tomflint	they're cheap too
2015-10-22 19:00:54	tomflint	all you need is a 0.1g resolution, 6lb 
2015-10-22 19:01:18	indeedwatson	yeah i'll have to look into that
2015-10-22 19:01:41	indeedwatson	im gonna go make the dough
2015-10-22 19:02:47	tomflint	sweet
2015-10-22 19:03:16	indeedwatson	oh wait
2015-10-22 19:03:43	indeedwatson	nvm
2015-10-22 19:45:49	indeedwatson	i think it's too wet
2015-10-22 19:58:47	tomflint	ha
2015-10-22 19:58:59	tomflint	you can add in a little flour -- but higher hydration isn't a bad thing
2015-10-22 19:59:25	tomflint	when you knead wet dough, wet your hands
2015-10-22 20:00:00	tomflint	as it gets softer and drier, use a little flour on your hands --
2015-10-22 20:02:11	indeedwatson	yeah, the thing is when i starts sticking to the surface too much
2015-10-22 20:02:45	indeedwatson	last time i did 60% and it was perfect for handling it, now it was more like 65 AND a bit of oil
2015-10-22 20:05:34	tomflint	oh! don't add oil until the very end 
2015-10-22 20:05:49	tomflint	its not the worst, but 65% is about the highest anyone can get --
2015-10-22 20:06:01	tomflint	add a little flour in -- but only the smallest bit at a time
2015-10-22 20:06:38	indeedwatson	i added the oil at the end
2015-10-22 20:06:52	indeedwatson	im letting it rise a bit before i knead it more and put it in the fridge
2015-10-22 20:10:53	tomflint	you can knead it and pop it right into the fridge 
2015-10-22 20:11:09	tomflint	if it rises and you knead it, you'll force out all of that gas 
2015-10-22 20:11:34	indeedwatson	that's what i normally do but im following the book and it says to do that
2015-10-22 20:11:43	indeedwatson	it also says to do 2 24h rises
2015-10-22 20:11:50	tomflint	oh sweet. let me know how that works
2015-10-22 20:12:14	indeedwatson	I'm not following it exactly cause i lack some elements
2015-10-22 20:24:06	tomflint	watch Stringer's hand just as Omar leaves the frame -- https://vid.me/byKK
2015-10-22 20:38:26	indeedwatson	this is definitely the softest dough i made
2015-10-22 20:38:32	indeedwatson	i hope it turns out gud
2015-10-22 20:38:57	indeedwatson	ha, i never noticed
2015-10-22 20:39:03	indeedwatson	you made me want to watch the wire now
