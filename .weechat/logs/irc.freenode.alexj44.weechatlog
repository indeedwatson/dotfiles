2015-11-12 14:01:45	AlexJ44	ctrl + f
2015-11-12 14:01:47	AlexJ44	Stalker
2015-11-12 14:01:52	AlexJ44	save as
2015-11-12 14:01:57	AlexJ44	:P
2015-11-12 14:02:24	AlexJ44	it might be better to download from a FTP client, so you don't risk having a crash 
2015-11-12 14:03:32	indeedwatson	i never used FTP
2015-11-12 14:03:42	indeedwatson	i'll look into it but im downloading it in the mean time
2015-11-12 14:03:48	AlexJ44	you figured your way with IRC, ftp is a breeze
2015-11-12 14:03:58	AlexJ44	just get filezilla or something
2015-11-12 14:04:15	AlexJ44	because your browser can't handle file download resuming
2015-11-12 14:04:33	indeedwatson	i think i tried it once to share files with my phone
2015-11-12 14:04:54	indeedwatson	but i have ports blocked in my router or something, i could never figure out how to unlock them, even tho it's supposed to be simple
2015-11-12 14:05:11	AlexJ44	yes, that might be aproblem
2015-11-12 14:05:20	AlexJ44	but you should be able to open them easily. it's important for torrenting
2015-11-12 14:06:20	indeedwatson	well i can torrent fine so it doesn't seem to be interfering with that
2015-11-12 14:06:46	indeedwatson	but ftp, or when i tried to use the weechat android app, i couldn't figure it out
2015-11-12 14:06:51	indeedwatson	maybe it's blocked by ISP
2015-11-12 14:07:23	AlexJ44	what's the speed you're downloading at?
2015-11-12 14:09:12	indeedwatson	1mb/s
2015-11-12 14:09:19	indeedwatson	but i also have torrent open
2015-11-12 14:10:04	indeedwatson	almost 2mb/s now
2015-11-12 14:10:18	indeedwatson	2 to 3 hours left, aint that bad
2015-11-12 14:11:04	AlexJ44	yeah, the speed might go up now 
2015-11-12 14:11:16	AlexJ44	because I just finished paths of glory 
2015-11-12 14:12:57	indeedwatson	2.5
2015-11-12 14:13:03	indeedwatson	this is about my download speed max
2015-11-12 14:13:30	AlexJ44	oh :(
2015-11-12 14:13:34	AlexJ44	well
2015-11-12 14:13:37	AlexJ44	hope it doesn't crash
2015-11-12 14:13:40	AlexJ44	i'm going to watch mine
2015-11-12 14:13:41	AlexJ44	see you

2015-11-12 16:22:26	AlexJ44	do you have the file in the downloads folder?
2015-11-12 16:23:33	indeedwatson	gah i think i lost it
2015-11-12 16:23:46	AlexJ44	if you had the file, you could resume through a ftp client
2015-11-12 16:26:02	indeedwatson	i tried to resume the download without thinking and it started again
2015-11-12 16:26:04	indeedwatson	im so stupid
2015-11-12 16:26:16	AlexJ44	it overwrote the previous file?
2015-11-12 16:27:17	indeedwatson	apparently
2015-11-12 16:30:04	AlexJ44	damn
2015-11-12 16:30:08	AlexJ44	i feel you
