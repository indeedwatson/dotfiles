2015-10-25 10:36:27	FilipinosRich	how did it work out further?
2015-10-25 10:38:21	inddwtsn	yo
2015-10-25 10:38:32	FilipinosRich	hi
2015-10-25 10:38:35	inddwtsn	i tried using my home line to activate whatsapp
2015-10-25 10:38:49	FilipinosRich	and?
2015-10-25 10:39:12	inddwtsn	i got the call and all, but you have to use the app from the same phone that you used for the verification :/
2015-10-25 10:39:18	inddwtsn	so i will have to get a new sim card
2015-10-25 10:39:36	inddwtsn	if only my boss didn't use WA I'd ditch it entirely
2015-10-25 10:40:38	FilipinosRich	Ditch what entirely?
2015-10-25 10:40:48	inddwtsn	whatsapp
2015-10-25 10:40:53	inddwtsn	i'd use telegram instead
2015-10-25 10:41:02	FilipinosRich	what's telegram
2015-10-25 10:41:27	inddwtsn	https://telegram.org/
2015-10-25 10:41:49	inddwtsn	more focus on privacy and it has standalone desktop programs
2015-10-25 10:41:54	FilipinosRich	Oh
2015-10-25 10:41:59	FilipinosRich	Hmm perhaps I should start using it too
2015-10-25 10:42:38	inddwtsn	yeah try it
2015-10-25 10:42:47	inddwtsn	btw i wanted to ask you 2 things
2015-10-25 10:43:21	inddwtsn	1. Approximately, how much should the batter on this phone last? To know how screwed up it is
2015-10-25 10:43:30	inddwtsn	2. recommend me some apps
2015-10-25 10:44:07	FilipinosRich	You should get at least a day out of it
2015-10-25 10:44:08	FilipinosRich	And err
2015-10-25 10:44:11	FilipinosRich	What apps do you need?
2015-10-25 10:44:24	inddwtsn	i gtg, today is voting day

2015-10-25 12:33:10	FilipinosRich	how is shutter island
2015-10-25 12:34:17	inddwtsn	it's okay, i liked the 1st half much better than the 2nd half
2015-10-25 12:34:25	inddwtsn	but it's a solid movie, I'd recommend it
2015-10-25 12:35:25	inddwtsn	what reddit app do you use?
2015-10-25 12:36:45	FilipinosRich	reddit is fun

2015-10-25 12:53:30	inddwtsn	with reddit apps it seems there's 3 or 4 that are very good, so it comes down to minor details
2015-10-25 12:54:11	FilipinosRich	which ones do you have
2015-10-25 12:54:34	inddwtsn	those 2 I just mentioned

2015-10-25 13:19:37	inddwtsn	im listening to a podcast, it's cool having a speaker that you can actually hear
2015-10-25 13:19:47	FilipinosRich	yeah
2015-10-25 13:39:56	inddwtsn	have you seen Snowpiercer?

2015-11-27 16:44:37	inddwtsn	never played 3 or nv
2015-11-27 16:44:52	inddwtsn	would play that instead, if i didn't have games to play already
2015-11-27 16:45:07	inddwtsn	you?
2015-11-27 16:50:08	FilipinosRich	eh
2015-11-27 16:50:12	FilipinosRich	I'm going to pick up 1/2 new games
2015-11-27 16:50:15	FilipinosRich	with black friday sales
2015-11-27 16:50:30	inddwtsn	like physical games?
2015-11-27 16:50:32	FilipinosRich	I'm thinking of AC:Syndicat efor 35$, Fallout 4 for around 40$ or The Witcher for 25$
2015-11-27 16:50:36	FilipinosRich	Nah digital 
2015-11-27 16:50:41	FilipinosRich	For my ps4
2015-11-27 16:51:37	inddwtsn	witcher 1??
2015-11-27 16:52:02	inddwtsn	i can't recall the last time i payed more than $20 for a game :p
2015-11-27 16:52:13	FilipinosRich	witcher 3
2015-11-27 16:52:29	FilipinosRich	how much did you pay for MGSV
2015-11-27 16:52:36	inddwtsn	it was a gift
2015-11-27 16:52:42	FilipinosRich	oh
2015-11-27 16:52:44	FilipinosRich	that's not fair then!
2015-11-27 16:52:45	inddwtsn	i probably would have payed 60
2015-11-27 16:52:51	FilipinosRich	well these are also gifts from my parents
2015-11-27 16:53:00	inddwtsn	i'd definitely get witcher 3
2015-11-27 16:53:00	FilipinosRich	but I'm jsut wondering what to get
2015-11-27 16:53:05	inddwtsn	i haven't played any witcher game
2015-11-27 16:53:05	FilipinosRich	I could also get MGSV
2015-11-27 16:53:15	inddwtsn	but based on the reviews and shit i want to play 3
2015-11-27 16:53:18	FilipinosRich	but haven't played any of the predecessors
2015-11-27 16:53:20	FilipinosRich	yeah
2015-11-27 16:53:26	FilipinosRich	witcher for 25$ is cheap as f
2015-11-27 16:53:30	FilipinosRich	but fallout and syndicate also look appealing
2015-11-27 16:53:33	FilipinosRich	I really like the AC franchise
2015-11-27 16:53:38	inddwtsn	i don't
2015-11-27 16:53:39	inddwtsn	hah
2015-11-27 16:53:49	inddwtsn	i barely played it but i don't like ubisoft
2015-11-27 16:53:49	FilipinosRich	although those games are all the same
2015-11-27 16:53:51	FilipinosRich	every year
2015-11-27 16:54:01	FilipinosRich	guess I'll get fallout and the witcher
2015-11-27 16:54:37	inddwtsn	yeah that's my main gripe
2015-11-27 16:54:52	inddwtsn	but tbh i much rather smaller games usually
2015-11-27 16:55:01	FilipinosRich	what do you mean rather smaller?
2015-11-27 16:55:02	inddwtsn	i loved mgsv but my goty is probably undertale
2015-11-27 16:55:04	FilipinosRich	not AAA?
