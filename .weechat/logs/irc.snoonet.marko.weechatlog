2015-12-03 19:17:34	marko	what kinda routine are you doing?
2015-12-03 19:17:50	inddwtsn	push pull split
2015-12-03 19:18:04	marko	yes, what kinda progression plan? as in sets and reps
2015-12-03 19:18:10	marko	and exercises
2015-12-03 19:18:35	inddwtsn	aiming for 4x10 pike pu, doing 3x15s lsit and yaad lean/frogstand/hs on push
2015-12-03 19:18:37	marko	you're doing push/pull/rest/push/pull/rest/rest?
2015-12-03 19:19:02	inddwtsn	pullups with 10kg, 3x3ish, tuck FL holds around 2x15s
2015-12-03 19:19:19	inddwtsn	yeah, depends what days i have to work
2015-12-03 19:25:47	marko	what kinda HS progression are you working on?
2015-12-03 19:29:26	inddwtsn	2x60s ctw holds, and then just kickups
2015-12-03 19:29:38	inddwtsn	and tuck hs sometimes
2015-12-03 19:29:41	marko	how are the ctw ones?
2015-12-03 19:29:42	inddwtsn	but always against wall
2015-12-03 19:29:43	marko	how is your form?
2015-12-03 19:29:45	marko	is it perfect?
2015-12-03 19:30:01	inddwtsn	if it was perfect i wouldn't be against the wall :p
2015-12-03 19:30:10	inddwtsn	but i think my shoulders are open enough
2015-12-03 19:30:13	marko	haha, but 60s is really long
2015-12-03 19:30:16	inddwtsn	i also do shoulder opening sometimes
2015-12-03 19:30:21	marko	what about PPT? That's the most important factor
2015-12-03 19:30:32	inddwtsn	yeah of course form declines towards the end
2015-12-03 19:30:42	marko	ok
2015-12-03 19:30:45	inddwtsn	i focus on that but it's hard to realize in the moment if it's perfect
2015-12-03 19:31:31	marko	ok ok
2015-12-03 19:32:49	inddwtsn	i hope gmb dude can help me get fs and overcome the fear of falling if i don't use a wall :D
2015-12-03 19:33:59	marko	http://pastebin.com/Mu1539Sk
2015-12-03 19:34:09	marko	this is what i would do if i was you. It seems crazy, but you have very ,very very very
2015-12-03 19:34:10	marko	low volume
2015-12-03 19:34:13	marko	and little exercises
2015-12-03 19:34:15	marko	but ok
2015-12-03 19:34:21	marko	if you did this for 1-3 weeks you'd see progress already
2015-12-03 19:34:25	marko	i can promise you that though :D
2015-12-03 19:34:45	marko	and i know you think "wow body rows after pull ups and fl? fuuuck nooo. I won't be able to do them like i used to"
2015-12-03 19:34:48	marko	it doesn't matter
2015-12-03 19:35:03	inddwtsn	keep in mind im cutting tho
2015-12-03 19:35:04	marko	you still need horizontal rowing, not just a static hold, because let's face it in FL you can't perfectly retract
2015-12-03 19:35:19	marko	so do it in a progression you can
2015-12-03 19:35:21	marko	more vertical
2015-12-03 19:36:42	inddwtsn	rows i can only do with a bar between two chairs
2015-12-03 19:36:49	inddwtsn	so i can't go all the way down
2015-12-03 19:37:04	marko	what about rings?
2015-12-03 19:37:16	marko	or doing them under a table?
2015-12-03 19:37:22	inddwtsn	too high
2015-12-03 19:37:38	marko	yes but maybe that will be the right progression for you now?
2015-12-03 19:37:41	marko	after the FL and pull ups
2015-12-03 19:37:56	marko	oh
2015-12-03 19:37:58	marko	i get what you mean
2015-12-03 19:38:40	marko	What about buying another pack of straps? Not offical ones, something like this http://www.zupljanka.com/images/img_4.jpg
2015-12-03 19:38:40		[ http://is.gd/8WNPCW ]
2015-12-03 19:38:51	marko	many workers use that here in our country it's super cheap i use it myself
2015-12-03 19:38:55	marko	the black ones in my videos
2015-12-03 19:39:06	marko	then you could lower them, you could strap them together with the other ones
2015-12-03 19:39:22	marko	oh you have this exact thing i just posted haha
2015-12-03 19:39:28	marko	just get another, cheap one
2015-12-03 19:39:35	marko	and put it around that one
2015-12-03 19:39:53	marko	it won't be _the_ most optimal way but it'll do

2015-12-03 19:47:57		[ http://is.gd/Xoo0UH ]
2015-12-03 19:47:59	marko	this is my split
2015-12-03 19:48:02	marko	me and alex made
2015-12-03 19:48:09	marko	well, the one we made was even more volume
2015-12-03 19:48:12	marko	and more accessories
2015-12-03 19:48:29	marko	but got some straight arm goals so i cut those
2015-12-03 19:49:04	marko	and i changed the bl to a pull day, bl destroys me so i can't do dips etc after 
2015-12-03 19:58:02	inddwtsn	nice
2015-12-03 19:58:22	inddwtsn	fl push?
2015-12-03 19:58:34	marko	yes
2015-12-03 19:58:45	marko	i prefer it better that way
2015-12-03 19:59:24	inddwtsn	how long does a workout take you
2015-12-03 19:59:52	marko	around 90-100 minutes
2015-12-03 19:59:58	marko	sometimes more if we chat ;D
2015-12-03 20:00:01	marko	with friends
2015-12-03 20:00:08	marko	my push days are the longest now
2015-12-03 20:00:11	marko	because of those 10 sets of dips
2015-12-03 20:00:19	marko	but this is just a phase for another 2 weeks
2015-12-03 20:00:21	marko	i'll handle it
2015-12-03 20:00:29	inddwtsn	i have to try working out without internet
2015-12-03 20:00:46	marko	yes
2015-12-03 20:01:03	marko	and up your volume, do more exercises
2015-12-03 20:01:08	marko	you've been training for a while now
2015-12-03 20:01:47	inddwtsn	yeah but im not as dedicated as you
2015-12-03 20:01:53	inddwtsn	if i feel something will hurt me, i stop
2015-12-03 20:02:11	marko	yes but sometimes you have to push even if just a little bit 
2015-12-03 20:02:20	inddwtsn	that's why im not doing much pull
2015-12-03 20:02:35	inddwtsn	i mentioned i felt something weird on my elbows sometimes at night
2015-12-03 20:03:00	inddwtsn	it stopped since i stopped stressing about doing 30+ pullups in a session
2015-12-03 20:04:00	marko	meh, sometimes it hurts, doesn't mean it's tendonitis. But you're rested now
2015-12-03 20:04:13	marko	how were you doing those 30+ pull ups?
2015-12-03 20:04:18	marko	try to do the progression i wrote
2015-12-03 20:04:26	marko	10x2,10x1,BWx5,BWx3,BWx3
2015-12-03 20:04:28	marko	you could do that right?
2015-12-03 20:04:49	inddwtsn	yeah
2015-12-03 20:05:09	inddwtsn	i was doing like.. drop sets? 10,8,6,6,4
2015-12-03 20:05:11	inddwtsn	bw of course
2015-12-03 20:05:37	marko	yeah you probably went to failure on each set
2015-12-03 20:06:11	marko	do what i wrote for 2 weeks and then we'll change it. Do it at least until you meet that GMB dude
2015-12-03 20:11:25	Â«	marko (cocaine@user/marko) has quit (Quit: Leaving)

2015-12-09 10:22:09	inddwtsn	around $55 for the 6 weeks cycle
2015-12-09 10:23:04	marko	this is seriously
2015-12-09 10:23:06	marko	blowing my god damn mind
2015-12-09 10:23:08	marko	does he have a normal job?
2015-12-09 10:23:13	marko	and does this on the side?
2015-12-09 10:23:18	inddwtsn	yeah, he's an engineer
2015-12-09 10:23:19	marko	do you realize must ONLINE personal trainers, who are bullshit
2015-12-09 10:23:20	marko	charge like
2015-12-09 10:23:23	marko	200 for 4 weeks
2015-12-09 10:23:25	marko	and shit like that
2015-12-09 10:23:32	marko	offline, in person training
2015-12-09 10:23:34	marko	is insanely expensive
2015-12-09 10:23:44	inddwtsn	i have no idea how much a normal pt charges here
2015-12-09 10:23:44	marko	especially from people who are known/work in a known community
2015-12-09 10:23:47	marko	like GMB
2015-12-09 10:23:49	marko	this is insane
2015-12-09 10:23:50	marko	:D
2015-12-09 10:23:55	marko	i hope he's not a serial killer
2015-12-09 10:23:56	inddwtsn	GMB isn't very known here tho
2015-12-09 10:24:11	marko	hm
2015-12-09 10:24:21	inddwtsn	i did 2 workouts so far
2015-12-09 10:24:29	marko	still, like a 4 week in person routine would be at least 200$ i would guess
2015-12-09 10:24:31	marko	how did it go?
2015-12-09 10:24:54	inddwtsn	the first time i was rekt because it's circuits
2015-12-09 10:25:21	inddwtsn	a workout usually took me like 2 hours because i fucked around too much between rests
2015-12-09 10:25:25	inddwtsn	but it took me 50mins
2015-12-09 10:25:37	inddwtsn	and my heart was pounding really hard at the end
2015-12-09 10:25:51	marko	that's aweso me
2015-12-09 10:25:58	marko	but weird that it's a circuit
2015-12-09 10:26:20	inddwtsn	yeah, i'll ask him why 
2015-12-09 10:26:45	marko	maybe he wants you to get used to it, make you sweat as fuck, so later on when doing it normally, with 1-2 minute rests between sets
2015-12-09 10:26:46	inddwtsn	but he said like 'lets try this for now'
2015-12-09 10:26:49	marko	you'll be like "wow this is easy""
2015-12-09 10:26:52	marko	a mental thing
2015-12-09 10:26:54	marko	i bet it's this
2015-12-09 10:26:56	marko	100%
2015-12-09 10:27:04	marko	:P
2015-12-09 10:27:11	inddwtsn	he wants me to focus more on technique and not worry that much about reps
2015-12-09 10:27:26	marko	yeah
2015-12-09 10:27:43	inddwtsn	so while normally i'd be skeptic of circuits now I just do it cause with the stress i had from pullups and shit, it's nice to not think about reps and still find it challenging
2015-12-09 10:27:55	marko	yeah that's cool
2015-12-09 10:27:55	marko	just do it
2015-12-09 10:28:26	inddwtsn	at the very least it got me doing legs again :p
2015-12-09 10:28:32	inddwtsn	i had strong doms for 2 days
2015-12-09 10:29:40	marko	nice :D
2015-12-09 10:30:00	inddwtsn	pistols AND shrimps
2015-12-09 10:30:19	marko	yeah i remember that you told me
2015-12-09 10:30:26	marko	i'm doing pistols too nowadays as a burn out
2015-12-09 10:30:29	marko	after back squats
2015-12-09 10:30:33	inddwtsn	nice
2015-12-09 10:31:26	marko	i need to stop smoking cigaretes
2015-12-09 10:31:54	inddwtsn	yes definitely
2015-12-09 10:32:02	inddwtsn	i thought it was just joints
2015-12-09 10:32:14	marko	when i smoke less joints, i smoke more cigarettes
2015-12-09 10:32:23	marko	i'm addicted to that
2015-12-09 10:32:29	marko	smoking feeling i guess, i heard people talking about it
2015-12-09 10:32:38	marko	having a stick in your mouth and smoke in your mouth
2015-12-09 10:32:40	marko	i really like that feeling
2015-12-09 10:33:22	inddwtsn	yeah it can look cool
2015-12-09 10:33:38	inddwtsn	but the smell, yellow teeth, probable cancer, not so much
2015-12-09 10:34:19	marko	yeah
2015-12-09 12:13:20	Â«	marko (marijuana@user/marko) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2016-01-04 14:45:19	marko	my friend is training under me now for 3 months and he started with 3-4 pull ups (2 good ones, 2 ugly ones)
2016-01-04 14:45:26	marko	and can do now 8+ (haven't tested him for more)
2016-01-04 14:45:31	marko	with that paused technique until 5 reps
2016-01-04 14:45:33	marko	if you remember
2016-01-04 14:45:51	inddwtsn	tell me again that technique
2016-01-04 14:46:27	marko	basicaly each set that is under the number 5 (i like to set it to 3,5,later on 8) you do 10s negatives to reach that number
2016-01-04 14:46:32	marko	so if you do 4 pull ups, you do another negative
2016-01-04 14:46:40	marko	and sometimes it depends, 10s negatives, or 5s mtop hold, 5s middle hold
2016-01-04 14:46:45	marko	but basicaly, it's the same shit
2016-01-04 14:46:49	inddwtsn	ah ok
2016-01-04 14:46:58	inddwtsn	i don't think it'd be useful mixed with circuits
2016-01-04 14:47:03	marko	it wouldn't no
2016-01-04 14:47:05	marko	i'm just saying
2016-01-04 14:47:08	marko	i'm proud at him hehe
2016-01-04 17:11:38	inddwtsn	wanna formcheck tuck fl pulls
2016-01-04 17:11:50	marko	ok cool

2016-01-04 17:13:54	marko	good, but try to get waaaay more control in the pull and later on, try to hold the position for 2s
2016-01-04 17:14:06	marko	how many sets/reps are you doing?
2016-01-04 17:14:43	inddwtsn	yeah its hard to do it slower :/
2016-01-04 17:14:54	inddwtsn	im doing 30s, like everything else
2016-01-04 17:15:12	inddwtsn	basically, pike pu, tuck fl pulls, pistols, arch holds, 30s each, rest
2016-01-04 17:15:17	inddwtsn	and repeat, 3 more times
2016-01-04 17:15:21	inddwtsn	that's workout B
2016-01-04 17:15:48	inddwtsn	workout A is: hollow pu, pullups, shrimp squats, and hollow holds
2016-01-04 17:16:10	marko	oh yeah timer right
2016-01-04 17:16:33	marko	hollow pull ups and then normal pull ups?
2016-01-04 17:16:55	inddwtsn	hollow pushups
2016-01-04 17:17:02	marko	ohhh
2016-01-04 17:17:04	marko	cool like it
2016-01-04 17:17:10	marko	it's basically
2016-01-04 17:17:15	marko	in the recommended routine fashion
2016-01-04 17:17:29	inddwtsn	and before all that, warmup, crowstand/elbow lever, ctw/btw
2016-01-04 17:17:48	marko	why back to wall :'(
2016-01-04 17:18:12	inddwtsn	ctw on A, btw on B
2016-01-04 17:18:25	inddwtsn	because it's the only thing i can do to get away from the wall
2016-01-04 17:19:47	marko	what about stomach to wall toe pulls, heel pulls
2016-01-04 17:19:49	marko	single leg pulls :(

2016-01-04 17:22:15	marko	ok i understand yeah
2016-01-04 17:22:48	inddwtsn	i really want to learn to do a proper bail and get the confidence to try fs without a wall at all
2016-01-04 17:22:55	inddwtsn	even if its a shitty arches fs
2016-01-04 17:23:01	inddwtsn	but i dont have the proper space for that
2016-01-04 17:25:49	marko	the way i bail is to pirote
2016-01-04 17:25:51	marko	or how to call it
2016-01-04 17:25:54	marko	like rotate on just one arm
2016-01-04 17:26:02	marko	last time i learned to "roll"
2016-01-04 17:26:07	inddwtsn	yes that
2016-01-04 17:26:17	inddwtsn	i do that sort of, but more controlled
2016-01-04 17:26:28	inddwtsn	i never did the "panic" quick pirouete
2016-01-04 17:26:48	marko	me neither
2016-01-04 17:26:53	marko	i think i do it pretty smooth
2016-01-04 17:26:56	marko	but the roll is better
2016-01-04 17:27:00	marko	because it's "even"
2016-01-04 17:27:02	marko	know what i mean?
2016-01-04 17:27:05	marko	you don't lean on no side etc
2016-01-04 17:27:08	inddwtsn	yeah
2016-01-04 17:27:23	marko	i know it sounds silly but you add those up like 100000 repetitions over some years
2016-01-04 17:27:28	marko	and you get a slight imbalance sooner or later
2016-01-04 17:27:33	marko	i'm really paranoid about these kinda things
2016-01-04 17:27:33	marko	:D
2016-01-04 17:27:42	inddwtsn	i worry about that cause i kick up with the same leg every time
2016-01-04 17:27:45	inddwtsn	and also come down
2016-01-04 17:27:47	inddwtsn	with the same leg first
2016-01-04 17:27:51	marko	i did that and you know what happened?
2016-01-04 17:27:53	marko	my handstand was shifted
2016-01-04 17:27:54	marko	to the side
2016-01-04 17:27:55	marko	always
2016-01-04 17:28:01	marko	i only now fixed that by going back to wall and kicking alternatively
2016-01-04 17:28:03	inddwtsn	i dont think mine is, for now

2016-01-13 10:34:53	inddwtsn	yeah, fucking hard
2016-01-13 10:34:57	inddwtsn	i only did A
2016-01-13 10:35:04	inddwtsn	but it's time for a deload
2016-01-13 10:35:10	inddwtsn	so i might do B today with less effort
2016-01-13 10:35:31	inddwtsn	plus my elbow keeps bothering me at night so i might go to a doctor :/
2016-01-13 10:35:54	inddwtsn	also i can't do the bent arm tuck HS hold
2016-01-13 10:36:00	inddwtsn	(yaad hold basically)
2016-01-13 10:36:11	marko	i can't do that one either, well couldn't when i tried it it's been a few weeks now so who knows
2016-01-13 10:36:15	marko	i'm just building up strength right now
2016-01-13 10:36:27	marko	like normal hspu on the wall, but chest to wall, and that GMB bent legs straight legs thing etc
2016-01-13 10:36:30	marko	will worry about balance later
2016-01-13 10:36:36	marko	i don't think i'll have huge problems with it
2016-01-13 10:36:36	inddwtsn	antranik can, so jelly
2016-01-13 10:36:40	marko	yeah i saw it

2016-01-13 10:36:47	marko	he doesn't look like it
2016-01-13 10:36:51	marko	but he is actually pretty strong

2016-01-22 13:36:26	marko	tried a weighted pull up today after 4 months of doing non weighted, corrected pull ups
2016-01-22 13:36:29	marko	surprised myself :D
2016-01-22 13:37:00	marko	wasn't even training, but I was curious if i could pull up
2016-01-22 13:37:00	marko	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Xb5RuMfWs8
2016-01-22 13:37:01		[ http://is.gd/23waiQ ]
2016-01-22 13:37:08	marko	on my toes
2016-01-22 13:37:28	marko	could have pulled higher but it was already odd enough with having it shifted to the side
2016-01-22 13:37:54	marko	but my point is that 4 months ago i couldn't really pull that up for 1 rep and now i can, without even doing weighted pull ups
2016-01-22 13:38:04	marko	only the corrected ones, focusing on good form and the squeze
2016-01-22 13:38:09	inddwtsn	how much weight is that
2016-01-22 13:38:18	marko	28kg it's in the title
2016-01-22 13:38:31	inddwtsn	damn
2016-01-22 13:38:56	inddwtsn	oh sorry, i have yt default to take up the whole browser space so i didnt see the title
2016-01-22 13:38:59	marko	can't wait to see again in 3 months
2016-01-22 13:39:22	inddwtsn	did you see fitnessfaq's video about perfect pullups?
2016-01-22 13:39:30	inddwtsn	they're like the complete opposite of naterman's
2016-01-22 13:39:37	marko	natermans pull ups are DUMB
2016-01-22 13:39:38	marko	as fuck
2016-01-22 13:40:12	marko	everybody's talking about the perfect pull up now lately because Ido posted it on his IG 2 months ago or 1 month ago or so
2016-01-22 13:40:15	marko	basically you have to have very
2016-01-22 13:40:16	marko	very
2016-01-22 13:40:17	marko	very
2016-01-22 13:40:17	marko	very
2016-01-22 13:40:19	marko	strong retraction
2016-01-22 13:40:27	marko	and depression
2016-01-22 13:40:30	marko	i can't do it
2016-01-22 13:40:31	marko	can you?
2016-01-22 13:40:38	inddwtsn	not sure
2016-01-22 13:40:47	marko	just do normal pull ups, i prefer to be a tiny bit arched, but not like a huge arch
2016-01-22 13:40:50	marko	but no way PPT
2016-01-22 13:41:16	inddwtsn	but i was wondering about perfect pullups for AGEs, you know how antranik made the detailed pushups form video, and for pullups there's debate about hollow vs arch, elbows in vs out, etc
2016-01-22 13:41:45	marko	well
2016-01-22 13:41:52	marko	usually the perfect form doesn't always mean best form
2016-01-22 13:41:56	marko	what is perfect form? In antranik's vid
2016-01-22 13:41:57	marko	it's safety
2016-01-22 13:42:06	marko	but come on, are you really in danger if your elbow isn't properly over your wrist?
2016-01-22 13:42:25	marko	is it really bad to let the elbows flare a bit? THat's how most people build their chests...
2016-01-22 13:42:37	marko	there's no perfect form, in powerlifting people usually laugh when you ask this
2016-01-22 13:42:48	marko	always do this: lift as heavy and as much as you can while staying as protected as you can
2016-01-22 13:42:52	marko	and this differes from people and people
2016-01-22 13:42:55	marko	people to people*
2016-01-22 13:43:15	inddwtsn	yeah but antranik's vid covers a lot of mistakes such as arching a lot
2016-01-22 13:43:34	marko	yeah, but my buddy arches the shit out of his back and he's doing 80kg dips
2016-01-22 13:43:37	marko	and muscle ups for breakfast
2016-01-22 13:43:41	inddwtsn	you can say his video is aobut perfect beginner pushups form
2016-01-22 13:43:41	marko	and is totally ok
2016-01-22 13:43:55	inddwtsn	but he can do them hollow
2016-01-22 13:43:56	marko	and his form is spot on on most things he does
2016-01-22 13:43:56	inddwtsn	right?
2016-01-22 13:44:01	marko	yeah he can
2016-01-22 13:44:03	marko	10+reps
2016-01-22 13:44:10	inddwtsn	well, most people do arched to compensate
2016-01-22 13:44:12	marko	in push ups, i just try to stay slightly neutral
2016-01-22 13:44:25	marko	i used to worry about having PPT everywhere
2016-01-22 13:44:29	marko	ask phi if that's smart
2016-01-22 13:44:35	marko	gymnastics did that, but it's ok
2016-01-22 13:45:05	marko	they showed people the hollow body form and PPT and now everybody is always doing it and if you do 20 push ups with a neutral back
2016-01-22 13:45:08	marko	you get called out for no proper form
2016-01-22 13:45:15	marko	i mean come on, if he's not arching insanely
2016-01-22 13:45:17	marko	there's no big deal
2016-01-22 13:45:43	inddwtsn	well there's also the hollow pushups which are like with as much hollow as you can get
2016-01-22 13:45:46	inddwtsn	which i consider a variation
2016-01-22 13:46:33	inddwtsn	my workout has those arch hangs now, i find them really hard
2016-01-22 13:46:51	inddwtsn	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C995b3KLXS4
2016-01-22 13:46:53	inddwtsn	this
2016-01-22 13:47:19	marko	this is a good exercise and i've been telling you guys to do that since a year ago, got it from Ido too
2016-01-22 13:47:22	marko	i do it in my warmups
2016-01-22 13:47:26	marko	since... a year and a half
2016-01-22 13:47:28	marko	it's insanely hard
2016-01-22 13:47:38	marko	and i should pay more attention to it and actually try to progress
2016-01-22 13:47:43	marko	but i find it helps me get my scapula ready
2016-01-22 13:47:45	marko	for pulling stuff
2016-01-22 13:47:45	inddwtsn	it's part of my after-strength i think
2016-01-22 13:48:22	inddwtsn	yes, supersetted with ring support hold
2016-01-22 13:48:39	inddwtsn	do you want a video of how little i can arch? lol
2016-01-22 13:49:06	marko	yeah :D
2016-01-22 13:50:39	inddwtsn	seeing your pullups, it reminds me my pt told me to stay a bit at the top position each rep
2016-01-22 13:51:26	marko	alex recommends that too
2016-01-22 13:51:37	marko	i started doing that when rehabbing my shoulder/pull ups
2016-01-22 13:51:40	marko	and will probably always do a bit
2016-01-22 13:51:44	marko	even if for a second
2016-01-22 13:53:22	marko	do you have a vid? :D
2016-01-22 13:53:52	inddwtsn	of the arch thing?
2016-01-22 13:57:49	marko	yeah
2016-01-22 14:20:22	inddwtsn	ok hang on (pun intended)
2016-01-22 14:23:41	marko	ok :D
2016-01-22 14:25:51	inddwtsn	omg it's so pathetic
2016-01-22 14:25:55	inddwtsn	im embarrassed to show it
2016-01-22 14:26:41	marko	do it fgt
2016-01-22 14:28:34	inddwtsn	https://youtu.be/aBZvPZ1ai5M
2016-01-22 14:30:06	marko	dude it's not bad!
2016-01-22 14:30:12	marko	i prefered doing this on a bar though
2016-01-22 14:30:19	marko	the stable grip let's me retract easier
2016-01-22 14:30:19	inddwtsn	true
2016-01-22 14:30:21	marko	idk how to explain
2016-01-22 14:30:33	inddwtsn	but my bar it's at an even more awkward spot
2016-01-22 14:30:44	inddwtsn	but seeing the ido video with that dude
2016-01-22 14:30:50	inddwtsn	i feel like im barely moving at all
2016-01-22 14:30:52	marko	those dudes are super duper advanced
2016-01-22 14:30:54	marko	and it's not fair
2016-01-22 14:31:00	marko	srsly
2016-01-22 14:31:03	marko	i thought this wass something simple too
2016-01-22 14:31:07	marko	and that there's something wrong with me
2016-01-22 14:31:07	marko	it's not
2016-01-22 14:31:10	marko	those dudes are super advanced
2016-01-22 14:31:48	inddwtsn	so i just keep doing it, or do you see any mistakes?
2016-01-22 14:32:09	inddwtsn	i have to actively remember not to bring my legs up cause im so used to doing that for tuck FL/sct
2016-01-22 14:36:05	marko	just really focus on depressing and retracting
2016-01-22 14:36:09	marko	and basically that's it
