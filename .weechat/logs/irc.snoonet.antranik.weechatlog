2015-09-23 11:30:02	inddwtsn	after emmet's stretches
2015-09-23 11:30:38	Antranik	neat
2015-09-23 11:30:44	Antranik	which ones u doing
2015-09-23 11:31:25	inddwtsn	that one with the stick
2015-09-23 11:31:37	inddwtsn	and the calves
2015-09-23 11:31:42	inddwtsn	and maybe jefferson curls
2015-09-23 11:31:55	Antranik	fuck yeah
2015-09-23 11:32:07	inddwtsn	not sure how much weight to use
2015-09-23 11:33:09	Antranik	honestly u could even do it without weight and get a good effect, so dont overthink it, just hold any weight
2015-09-23 11:34:31	inddwtsn	i've done them before, but i don't have a box, i have to do them at the top of the stairs
2015-09-23 11:35:04	Antranik	yea i dont have the best place for them either
2015-09-23 11:35:10	Antranik	i have to go up on a ledge outside hee
2015-09-23 11:35:55	inddwtsn	top of a mountain
2015-09-23 11:36:13	Antranik	heheh
2015-09-25 16:00:09	inddwtsn	bro
2015-09-25 16:01:26	Antranik	yes
2015-09-25 16:01:45	inddwtsn	took me 50mins to do emmet's stuff
2015-09-25 16:01:52	inddwtsn	i got to 2nd knuckle pike
2015-09-25 16:02:09	inddwtsn	then i did plow pose for less than a minute and got to 1st knuckle
2015-09-25 16:02:21	Antranik	meaning your fingers are down but not your palms?
2015-09-25 16:02:22	inddwtsn	i think i need to modify the routine
2015-09-25 16:02:36	Antranik	so you're almost htere?
2015-09-25 16:02:52	inddwtsn	nah, i think palms is still far
2015-09-25 16:03:04	inddwtsn	but my point was that the plow pose helped a lot in less time
2015-09-25 16:03:07	Antranik	but fingers are flat?
2015-09-25 16:03:25	Antranik	well, it's not smart to do plow before warming up tho, so it helped that u did it after
2015-09-25 16:03:48	inddwtsn	yeah but 50min is way too much for 1 stretch for me :(
2015-09-25 16:04:02	inddwtsn	i'll experiment with less sets of the other stuff maybe
2015-09-25 16:04:06	inddwtsn	i could try asking emmet
2015-09-25 16:04:18	Antranik	50min for 1 stretch?
2015-09-25 16:04:31	inddwtsn	i mean pike stretch is the goal
2015-09-25 16:04:34	Antranik	it's like calves, then ssgm, then something else, right?
2015-09-25 16:04:44	Antranik	ah i see
2015-09-25 16:04:45	inddwtsn	jcurls, yeah
2015-09-25 16:04:55	Antranik	eh, is it really that long? lol
2015-09-25 16:05:12	Antranik	i mean, is 50 minutes a long time?
2015-09-25 16:05:40	inddwtsn	to me, for something i don't enjoy doing, just to get a pike, yeah
2015-09-25 16:05:55	Antranik	well how else are you going to get it?
2015-09-25 16:06:25	inddwtsn	idk, maybe i'll be content with fingers to floor
2015-09-25 16:06:33	Antranik	you know, honestly, you're lucky to have this cut out routine for you, i just did yoga for years and these things just came slowly
2015-09-25 16:06:53	Antranik	but i didn't fret about the goals, just enjoyed the process, cause u know, yoga
2015-09-25 16:07:25	inddwtsn	yeah, i can't say i enjoy the process in this, i just have the goal of palms to floor which isn't really that ambitious
2015-09-25 16:07:50	Antranik	it is ambitious if u never had that before
2015-09-25 16:08:02	inddwtsn	when i touched my toes for the first time, it came out of nowhere and i wasn't even trying
2015-09-25 16:08:38	inddwtsn	i was doing plow cause i enjoyed it, then i squatted, grabbed my toes, got up and it took me a few seconds to realize i was grabbing my toes with my knees locked lol
2015-09-25 16:09:08	Antranik	nice
2015-09-25 16:09:18	Antranik	r u playing music
2015-09-25 16:09:43	inddwtsn	while i stretch?
2015-09-25 16:09:49	Antranik	yea
2015-09-25 16:10:14	Antranik	helps a lot, especially headphones, to help u enjoy the process
2015-09-25 16:12:58	inddwtsn	true
2015-09-25 16:13:05	inddwtsn	i usually watch twitch streams
2015-09-25 16:13:27	Antranik	damn, u can watch things?
2015-09-25 16:13:34	Antranik	i guess u can during the calf thing
2015-09-25 16:13:39	Antranik	btw do u really do 3x90
2015-09-25 16:13:45	Antranik	thats cause thats forever
2015-09-25 16:13:54	Antranik	i mean, caus ethe it's 6x90
2015-09-25 16:16:03	inddwtsn	i just let them run in the background
2015-09-25 16:16:12	inddwtsn	yes, it's 9min total of calves alone
2015-09-25 16:16:33	inddwtsn	then 4x10 with 15s hold at the end of each set, per leg
2015-09-25 16:16:36	inddwtsn	and then jcurls
2015-09-25 17:09:29	--	irc: disconnected from server
2015-10-23 02:25:18	Antranik	did i actually miss drama?
2015-10-23 02:27:49	inddwtsn	yes
2015-10-23 02:28:01	Antranik	fuck
2015-10-23 02:28:06	Antranik	between who and who
2015-10-23 02:28:23	Antranik	i can check the scroll on my other comp
2015-10-23 02:28:32	inddwtsn	first there was mild drama when cummisar told em that he was sick of him here and on fb and that he was driving him away form the community
2015-10-23 02:29:06	inddwtsn	and then later foxlet came in and said hi and _668 called him a furry fag and foxlet kicked him
2015-10-23 02:29:15	Antranik	wowwtf 
2015-10-23 02:29:28	inddwtsn	and 688 whined of course about op abuse
2015-10-23 02:29:49	inddwtsn	and then one thing led to the other and em opped 668
2015-10-23 02:29:55	inddwtsn	and 688 kicked foxlet
2015-10-23 02:30:16	Antranik	EM OPPED 668?!
2015-10-23 02:30:27	inddwtsn	and after a while foxlet came back and said he wasn't gonna come back because who wanted to be in a chan with this kind of ops
2015-10-23 02:31:21	Antranik	damn that sucks
2015-10-23 02:31:36	inddwtsn	  foxlet | Really don’t see the point of being in a community with chanops of this caliber.
2015-10-23 02:31:42	inddwtsn	that was his exact line
2015-10-23 02:31:49	inddwtsn	yeah :/
2015-10-23 02:32:09	Antranik	ya, em is stupid

2015-10-23 02:32:53	Antranik	imagine these agents came in to save us from our IRC drama
2015-10-23 02:33:06	Antranik	no it's okay we could, i'll talk to solfire about it
2015-10-23 02:33:11	Antranik	he will care
2015-10-23 02:33:15	inddwtsn	what if they come in and they side with the ops 
2015-10-23 02:33:27	Antranik	who
2015-10-23 02:33:28	inddwtsn	do you want me to screen cap the log?

2015-10-23 02:37:01	inddwtsn	it was less than an hour ago i think
2015-10-23 02:37:05	inddwtsn	yeah for sure
2015-10-23 02:37:28	inddwtsn	the channel wouldn't be what it is without her

2015-10-23 02:50:39	inddwtsn	that's not all of it but it's what i can be bothered to screenshot
2015-10-23 13:44:33	inddwtsn	did _6886 come back

2015-10-23 13:44:56	Antranik	thats him, no?
2015-10-23 13:45:27	inddwtsn	yeah, be he hasn't talked since foxlet left
2015-10-23 13:45:41	Antranik	good
2015-10-23 13:46:12	inddwtsn	i thought maybe he was banned
2015-10-23 13:46:14	Antranik	i think a meeting is in order
2015-10-23 13:46:19	Antranik	between the mods
2015-10-23 13:46:35	Antranik	to talk of m092's idiocy
2015-10-23 13:47:11	Antranik	but i dont think anybody else cares
2015-10-23 13:47:20	Antranik	so i may have to do it personally
2015-10-23 13:47:51	inddwtsn	i should've screencapped cummisar's complaint
2015-10-23 13:48:07	inddwtsn	i think solfire would care more if he saw that, since he did so much work to get the community going
2015-10-23 13:48:12	Antranik	yes

2015-11-12 13:07:06	Antranik	hey i wanna post my shoulder rolls video on /r/videos
2015-11-12 13:07:38	Antranik	do u think i should use this title: "Here's a bodyweight progression exercise that you could do anytime to help loosen up your neck and upper back and increase scapular mobility. Feels great!"
2015-11-12 13:07:58	inddwtsn	i think it's a bit long
2015-11-12 13:08:05	inddwtsn	make it more clickbatey
2015-11-12 13:08:12	Antranik	how
2015-11-12 13:08:36	inddwtsn	EXTREME WR SHOULDER ROLLS
2015-11-12 13:08:38	Antranik	the original title i used on r/fit and r/bwf was simply the title of the video, which was completely different
2015-11-12 13:08:42	Antranik	heheh
2015-11-12 13:09:01	inddwtsn	i'd mention that you can do it at home with 0 equipment
2015-11-12 13:09:08	inddwtsn	i mean, that's what bodyweight implies
2015-11-12 13:09:10	Antranik	yeah
2015-11-12 13:09:21	inddwtsn	but normal people aren't used to the term
2015-11-12 13:09:24	Antranik	correct
2015-11-12 13:10:07	Antranik	Here's a progression exercise that you could do without any equipment to help instantly loosen up your neck and shoulders and increase scapular mobility. Feels FUCKING FANTASTIC!
2015-11-12 13:10:18	Antranik	not clickbaitey enough still
2015-11-12 13:10:46	inddwtsn	i don't think most people know what scapular mobility means :p
2015-11-12 13:11:15	Antranik	yea they dont
2015-11-12 13:33:19	Antranik	how about this 
2015-11-12 13:33:20	Antranik	Here's a Shoulder Rolls progression exercise that you could do without equipment, anytime, to help loosen up your neck and upper back! Feels great!
2015-11-12 13:33:43	inddwtsn	sounds good
2015-11-12 13:33:58	Antranik	i know it's not the most click-baitey thing
2015-11-12 13:34:12	Antranik	but, meh, can't be that bad, haha
2015-11-12 13:34:25	inddwtsn	use that one
2015-11-12 13:34:41	Antranik	thanks
2015-11-19 00:55:42	indeedwatson	the guy said he started on january and can tuck planche on rings, do 30 pullups, muscles ups, FL, BL
2015-11-19 00:55:55	indeedwatson	so we're mostly skeptical
2015-11-19 00:56:06	Antranik	yea i bet it's all bad form but thats cool
2015-11-19 00:56:10	Antranik	whatever
2015-11-19 00:56:10	Antranik	lol
2015-11-19 00:56:39	indeedwatson	also, all that at 32
2015-11-19 00:58:17	Antranik	yea why not, who knows
2015-11-19 00:58:34	indeedwatson	@q shrug
2015-11-19 01:42:07	--	irc: disconnected from server
2015-11-26 18:52:56	inddwtsn	i spent like 40mins self massaging with 2 tennis balls in a sock
2015-11-26 20:22:15	Antranik	FUCK YEAH
2015-11-26 20:22:19	Antranik	FUCK YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!
2015-11-26 20:51:56	inddwtsn	hahah
2015-11-26 20:52:03	inddwtsn	my lower back hurts tho :(
2015-11-26 23:04:58	inddwtsn	bro
2015-11-27 16:45:04	Antranik	hey bro
2015-11-27 16:45:07	Antranik	why does your lower back hurt
2015-11-27 16:45:24	inddwtsn	i don't know, it's an old injury that comes and goes
2015-11-27 16:48:03	Antranik	what triggers it
2015-11-27 16:49:12	inddwtsn	depends how sensitive it is, sometimes i could do my pike stretching fine, and i needed to go into plow pose, straighten one leg with the other bent, and move the straight leg around
2015-11-27 16:49:24	inddwtsn	but now if i do pike stretch i feel it right away
2015-11-27 16:49:39	Antranik	#triggered
2015-11-27 16:49:47	Antranik	dang that sucks
2015-11-27 16:49:54	Antranik	did u used to do jeffy curls
2015-11-27 16:50:01	inddwtsn	particularly when i rotate the pelvis forward
2015-11-27 16:50:10	inddwtsn	yeah i've done them often
2015-11-27 16:50:12	Antranik	u mean when u stick your butt out?
2015-11-27 16:50:16	inddwtsn	helped a lot getting palms to floor
2015-11-27 16:50:17	inddwtsn	yes
2015-11-27 16:50:28	Antranik	and u stretch your hip flexors regularly?
2015-11-27 16:50:57	inddwtsn	im not sure if they get stretched in the stretches i was doing
2015-11-27 16:51:12	Antranik	do u couch stretch
2015-11-27 16:51:12	inddwtsn	does the bent leg hamstring stretch from kit count?
2015-11-27 16:51:18	Antranik	not really
2015-11-27 16:51:20	inddwtsn	i did a bit recently
2015-11-27 16:51:25	inddwtsn	but not regularly
2015-11-27 16:51:30	Antranik	it stretches it a bit but couch stretch is the most effective
2015-11-27 16:53:46	Antranik	make couch stretch a daily thing, there is a lot to be had out of that stretch
2015-11-27 16:54:03	inddwtsn	yeah maybe i'll stop feeling it in my quad
2015-11-27 16:54:24	Antranik	u will, one day
2015-11-27 16:58:10	inddwtsn	how much time should i stay on it
2015-11-27 16:58:21	Antranik	2 minutes each side
2015-11-27 16:58:28	inddwtsn	i'll do it now
2015-11-27 16:58:47	Antranik	a lot of people try to bring their butt to their heel
2015-11-27 16:59:05	Antranik	instead try to bring your butt forward as much as possible to actually put the hip into extension
2015-11-27 16:59:16	inddwtsn	yeah like ppt?
2015-11-27 16:59:17	Antranik	hip extension is a strange concept for most people to understand
2015-11-27 16:59:25	Antranik	hip extension and ppt are two different things
2015-11-27 17:00:17	inddwtsn	but what am i supposed to do with my pelvis
2015-11-27 17:00:22	Antranik	ppt
2015-11-27 17:00:42	inddwtsn	oh ok
2015-11-27 17:08:37	inddwtsn	should my torso be upright or bending forward?
2015-11-27 17:09:00	Antranik	do the first minute bent forward, then if u wanna take it to the next level go upright
2015-11-27 18:07:55	inddwtsn	man this is depressing me, i don't know if i should completely stop any pike stuff until the pain goes away 
2015-11-27 18:10:10	Antranik	maybe
2015-11-27 18:10:14	Antranik	it's okay, work on other things!

2015-11-27 18:41:52	Antranik	what about yoga
2015-11-27 18:43:22	inddwtsn	i do it like twice a month
2015-11-27 19:11:09	inddwtsn	kit's psoas stretch relieves the pain a bit
2015-11-27 19:11:15	inddwtsn	gonna do it every day
2015-11-27 19:11:28	inddwtsn	my left leg goes numb with it but it sort of feels nice
2015-11-27 19:11:58	Antranik	which stretch ist hat
2015-11-27 19:12:02	Antranik	link?
2015-11-27 19:17:22	inddwtsn	sorry piriformis
2015-11-27 19:17:29	inddwtsn	i always get those confused, are they related?
2015-11-27 19:17:40	inddwtsn	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wT4948tW2hw
2015-11-27 19:17:56	inddwtsn	this one mostly, i try to lie my forearms on the floor and rest for a min
2015-11-27 19:18:47	Antranik	oh nice
2015-11-27 19:18:53	Antranik	nah they're not related
2015-11-27 19:19:06	Antranik	piriformis externally rotates the femur
2015-11-27 19:19:11	inddwtsn	actually, i said a bit, but walking around i realize it helped a lot
2015-11-27 19:19:14	inddwtsn	like almost magic
2015-11-27 19:19:14	Antranik	psoas flexes the hip
2015-11-27 19:19:18	Antranik	oh nice!
2015-11-27 19:19:25	Antranik	everyone needs this
2015-11-27 19:19:26	Antranik	:D
2015-11-27 19:19:52	inddwtsn	the first time i did it, that was my exact thought
2015-11-27 19:20:02	inddwtsn	i NEED to do this
2015-11-27 19:20:31	inddwtsn	i tihnk if i knew more anatomy i'd be able to pinpoint what it's in my body that hurts
2015-11-27 19:20:55	Antranik	yea, probably
2015-12-12 16:23:34	inddwtsn	wanna see heel pulls?
2015-12-12 16:41:19	Antranik	sure
2015-12-12 16:44:02	inddwtsn	https://www.dropbox.com/s/ae2bbus2b6hl9u7/20151212_160834.mp4?dl=0
2015-12-12 16:52:37	Antranik	okay so
2015-12-12 16:52:47	Antranik	you're not exactly doing them properl
2015-12-12 16:52:52	Antranik	properly*
2015-12-12 16:53:06	Antranik	you're bringing the feet away from the wall by flexing your hips
2015-12-12 16:53:21	Antranik	but you should be pointing the feet straight up up upupupuupppppppppp and keepEVERYTHING TIGHT
2015-12-12 16:53:40	Antranik	and the only thing that causes your feet to come off the wall is the intense gripping of the floor with your fingers
2015-12-12 16:53:56	Antranik	then when you feel they come off, relax the grip and let the feet go back to the wall 
2015-12-12 16:53:59	Antranik	and repeat
2015-12-12 16:54:04	Antranik	remember keep EVERYTHING TIGHT TIGHT TIGHT
2015-12-12 16:54:10	Antranik	like ERRRYYYTHANG
2015-12-12 16:54:28	Antranik	so your bodyline stays pretty much almost exactly the same
2015-12-12 16:54:31	Antranik	the entire time
2015-12-12 16:54:45	Antranik	it'll be just barely arched if you're doing it right
2015-12-12 16:55:00	Antranik	and u may have to pike to save it but that's only if you go too much down
2015-12-12 16:57:12	inddwtsn	in emmet's video it looks like she does it from the hip/abs
2015-12-12 16:57:24	Antranik	yea she's not the best model honestly
2015-12-12 16:57:29	Antranik	and emmet holds her feet lol
2015-12-12 16:57:30	inddwtsn	heh
2015-12-12 16:57:42	Antranik	to keep her from falling 
2015-12-12 16:57:56	Antranik	CHEATING
2015-12-12 16:58:13	inddwtsn	i'll try again
2015-12-12 16:58:47	Antranik	push through the shoulders, squeeze the butt, point the toes and then grip da ground 
2015-12-12 17:58:45	inddwtsn	can you see anything 
2015-12-12 17:58:46	inddwtsn	lol
2015-12-12 18:00:17	Antranik	i cant really see your legs
2015-12-12 18:00:26	Antranik	but i can see you're holding the line more solid and trying it proper
2015-12-12 18:00:45	Antranik	so i reckon u improved!
2015-12-12 18:09:27	Antranik	oh man i got a bad joke but i wont say it in chat
2015-12-12 18:16:19	inddwtsn	what is it

2015-12-12 18:16:58	Antranik	and she was like im gonna go to finland
2015-12-12 18:17:17	Antranik	i wanted to be like, but explosives dont detonate well underwater
2015-12-12 18:17:27	inddwtsn	lol
2015-12-12 18:17:33	Antranik	fuck, lol

2015-12-19 18:14:39	Antranik	i did it to reduce render time

2015-12-19 18:15:13	inddwtsn	they're more expensive than the flexbar
2015-12-19 18:15:13	Antranik	haha
2015-12-19 18:15:21	Antranik	thats weird
2015-12-19 18:15:21	inddwtsn	how far can you throw

2015-12-19 18:16:08	inddwtsn	damn that's a nice counter
2015-12-19 18:16:44	Antranik	yeee, parents house is nice
2015-12-19 18:17:03	Antranik	i realized i had to do many different shots
2015-12-19 18:17:18	Antranik	if i wanted to show things clearly
2015-12-19 18:17:41	inddwtsn	cheapest lacrosse ball is 180 pesos
2015-12-19 18:18:50	inddwtsn	it looks great
2015-12-19 18:18:53	inddwtsn	the video, overall
2015-12-19 18:18:58	inddwtsn	i might get a tennis ball and follow along
2015-12-19 18:19:03	Antranik	sweet
2015-12-19 18:19:09	Antranik	thanks dude
2015-12-19 18:19:20	Antranik	the actual footage was like, really long
2015-12-19 18:19:36	Antranik	and i kept snipping more and more to make it concise
2015-12-19 18:19:48	Antranik	idk if i snipped too much though
2015-12-19 18:20:03	Antranik	i can't really go back and unsnip, lol
2015-12-19 18:20:13	Antranik	but it was an interesting lesson
2015-12-19 18:20:15	inddwtsn	i think it's fine as it is, is there something important you feel wasn't included?
2015-12-19 18:20:43	Antranik	no i jsut wanted to better convey that i was really enjoying the experience as i was demonstrating
2015-12-19 18:21:03	Antranik	or to let them know it feels great everytime, without saying it everytime
2015-12-19 18:21:10	Antranik	u know what i mean?
2015-12-19 18:21:15	Antranik	but maybe that's obvious already
2015-12-19 18:21:51	Antranik	it's really a subtle thing and the only thing that sticks out... thats why i made a caption once that said "Btw this feels amazing" or something
2015-12-19 18:22:39	inddwtsn	yeah, but it's something that has to be experienced
2015-12-19 18:22:46	Antranik	true
2015-12-19 18:23:27	Antranik	well, cool
2015-12-19 18:23:48	Antranik	the song is pretty good too
2015-12-19 18:23:59	Antranik	could be better but, free is hard to find better
2015-12-19 18:30:27	Antranik	lol it's funny how it changes to the first scene
2015-12-19 18:30:37	Antranik	and it's talking about my dog having a tennis ball
2015-12-19 18:31:18	Antranik	then it's a few seconds of me talking to my dog, i guess that's cool
2015-12-19 18:31:26	Antranik	i won't cut out everything
2015-12-19 18:33:17	inddwtsn	that was cute
2015-12-19 18:33:36	Antranik	a lot of comments said they want doggie
2015-12-19 18:33:41	Antranik	so i tried to include her
2015-12-19 18:33:53	Antranik	like, random youtubers lol
2015-12-19 19:34:46	inddwtsn	compared to my dog, she seems rather uninterested in the ball
2015-12-19 19:35:06	Antranik	she knows the lacrosse ball is not her toy
2015-12-19 19:35:18	Antranik	but tennis ball is
2015-12-19 19:35:42	Antranik	my dog is always playing tho, rare for her age
2015-12-19 19:37:31	inddwtsn	when i stretch outside my dog tries to curl up on my feet or get his head under my arms
2015-12-19 19:40:30	Antranik	totally
2015-12-19 19:40:36	Antranik	it's playtime when you're on their level!
