2015-08-15 15:05:15	t3chguy	so it only shows channels that you are also in
2015-08-15 15:05:27	t3chguy	you can always try /whois SomePerson SomePerson
2015-08-15 15:05:32	t3chguy	repeating the nick shows more info
2015-08-15 15:05:43	winny	yes i assumed that is the case, though pretty certain some irc clients check joined channel lists
2015-08-15 15:05:51	Mikaela	there is nyuszika7h's answer though, but that is too difficult when compared to just /grep word
2015-08-15 15:05:52	winny	on top of WHOIS

2015-08-15 15:06:24	winny	huh, t3chguy is that part of the irc spec, or unique to weechat (specifying the whois arg twice)

2015-08-15 15:07:04	Mikaela	winny: part of irc spec, /wii is alias for it. with single nick it only queries the local server and might be missing away status or something

2015-08-15 15:07:41	winny	yeah, i am wrong, it's working as i expected, i guess this guy who said he's in two of the same channels is on a different network with me c:

2015-08-17 22:45:14	isolatedvirus	when i try to create these aliases, it just throws errors. one sec.
2015-08-17 22:45:20	indeedwatson	does your terminal have 256 colors enabled?
2015-08-17 22:45:40	isolatedvirus	i have no idea
2015-08-17 22:45:53	indeedwatson	do /colors
2015-08-17 22:46:36	isolatedvirus	command not found. but /color worked
2015-08-17 22:46:53	isolatedvirus	shows 8 colors, 64 pairs
2015-08-17 22:48:24	indeedwatson	how many does it display if you press alt c
2015-08-17 22:49:14	isolatedvirus	none, alt c doesnt work
2015-08-17 22:49:45	indeedwatson	well that's weird
2015-08-17 22:49:54	indeedwatson	does it not tell you to press alt c to see more colors tho?
2015-08-17 22:50:25	isolatedvirus	ok, got it to work
2015-08-17 22:50:29	isolatedvirus	it shows 7

2015-08-18 13:10:51	qstrahl	sim642, I have no prefix_suffix, and I use vertical bars for both chat_nick_suffix and prefix_same_nick
2015-08-18 13:11:34	qstrahl	The overall effect is space efficient and intuitive (for me at least); nicks are up against a bar of the same color, which extends down as far as the messages from the same nick
2015-08-18 13:11:56	qstrahl	Problem is, the bar immedaitely to the right of the nick needs to be the same colour too.
2015-08-18 13:12:26	qstrahl	Tell me more about triggers. I am determined to make this happen.
2015-08-18 13:14:10	reznorms	is there an option (or a script) to announce in the channel your away status whn you set it?

2015-08-18 13:17:39	reznorms	its not like i'm gonna set long annoyng message with ascii art or like that :D

2015-08-18 13:20:59	sim642	what is the benefit you get by doing that?
2015-08-18 13:21:13	cgt	No one cares that you're away
2015-08-18 13:21:25	cgt	and they don't care what music you're listening to either
2015-08-18 13:21:43	Nicd-	reznorms: the setting is irc.look.display_away
2015-08-18 13:21:46	cgt	and you shouldn't change your nickname when you go /away either
2015-08-18 13:22:55	reznorms	cgt, never mentioned changin nick or display music, and people looking for does care if you are there or not, deal with it

2015-08-18 13:23:45	sim642	that's the whole point away exists in IRC protocol

2015-08-18 13:24:20	sim642	then don't go away :P
2015-08-18 13:24:27	reznorms	eheh
2015-08-18 13:24:29	Nicd-	or just tell them. unless you talk all the time
2015-08-18 13:24:30	cgt	reznorms: People who care will look it up. And the other things I mentioned was just a general public service announcement.
2015-08-18 13:24:39	sim642	an automatic message is even more rude
2015-08-18 13:25:28	reznorms	ok whatever lol

2015-08-18 13:26:59	reznorms	you are not gonna see it dont worry, and they dont, or they would have told me to stop saying i'm going away
2015-08-18 13:27:31	cgt	It's ok to say you're going away. It's not ok to use a script to make such an announcement.

2015-08-18 13:51:20	sim642	also, removing irc_privmsg from highlight_tags_restrict should do the same
2015-08-18 13:51:26	qstrahl	It would be an empty list, and apparently if the value is "" it just uses the default which is "$nick"

2015-08-18 16:01:38	@nils_2	eh_eff: ^^
2015-08-18 16:01:42	eh_eff	sim642: many thanks! could you explain what that does?
2015-08-18 16:01:54	qstrahl	Okay. All systems appear to be nominal.
2015-08-18 16:02:04	sim642	in the process of upgrading your weechat a problem with that trigger was fixed
2015-08-18 16:02:12	sim642	but yours was on the old default still
2015-08-18 16:02:16	sim642	the broken one
2015-08-18 16:02:31	eh_eff	ah that makes sense, I did upgrade to 1.2 today
2015-08-18 16:02:33	sim642	or rather, the formats for triggers changed
2015-08-18 16:02:39	sim642	why not 1.3 ;)
2015-08-18 16:02:52	eh_eff	it's not in homebrew yet and i'm lazy :)
2015-08-18 16:02:55	sim642	also from what version?
2015-08-18 16:03:06	sim642	you should check the release notes since, maybe something more relevant
2015-08-18 16:03:06	eh_eff	1.1 I think
2015-08-18 16:03:34	@nils_2	its recommended to read the news before/after upgrading to a new weechat version
2015-08-18 16:03:36	sim642	it was in 1.1 already but I guess you didn't hit the problem then
2015-08-18 16:03:48	eh_eff	yeah weird
2015-08-18 16:03:58	eh_eff	will definitely consult the news first next time
2015-08-18 16:04:22	eh_eff	might just upgrade to 1.3 first to save myself any trouble later
2015-08-18 16:04:32	sim642	aww wait, release notes have nothing about the new buffer search functionality and changed binds in 1.3
2015-08-18 16:04:52	eh_eff	ok I'll wait a bit :)
2015-08-18 16:06:09	sim642	would it be possible to get that also noted down that new binds exist for better search functionality or is it too late now? FlashCode

2015-08-18 19:38:17	sim642	horse_ebooks, not sure if you got your answer about the SSH relay connection but the advantage is a good and secure connection which requires no extra port setup or anything
2015-08-18 19:40:00	horse_ebooks	the disadvantage is i still dont get the full weechat interface and instead i get the butchered mobile one
2015-08-18 19:40:24	sim642	of course not, also why butchered?
2015-08-18 19:40:39	sim642	if you want raw ssh on your phone, use any of the thousand ssh apps available
2015-08-18 19:40:56	sim642	but that won't remotely be as great to use on a mobile device as the special app
2015-08-18 19:41:06	sim642	which I think is the best irc app available
2015-08-18 19:41:18	sim642	and would even be great as a standalone mobile irc app

2015-08-18 20:12:07	sim642	but if you fix it here in #weechat and scroll about, it's fine, right?
2015-08-18 20:12:56	isolatedvirus	in weechat the nicklist separator gets an extra line next to alyx, then carries over to other channels. once i look at a specific channel it goes to hell
2015-08-18 20:13:20	isolatedvirus	well, now it appears to be borked.
2015-08-18 20:13:26	isolatedvirus	as soon as i type.
2015-08-18 20:13:48	isolatedvirus	heres a though. let me disconnect my relay clients.
2015-08-18 20:13:53	isolatedvirus	thought*
2015-08-18 20:14:03	sim642	that shouldn't make a difference
2015-08-18 20:14:20	sim642	it's an issue with crazy characters messing up your terminal
2015-08-18 20:14:34	isolatedvirus	yeah its the same now
2015-08-18 20:15:01	isolatedvirus	ok i didnt know if *maybe* the setting on the relay client being different for prefix length would cause an issue
2015-08-18 20:15:49	sim642	I'm not sure how to really fix this, because every time I've had my terminal mess up like that, it has been due to some line of IRC which has contained a character which has caused it
2015-08-18 20:15:54	sim642	so it's always been a temporary thing

2015-08-18 20:29:36	isolatedvirus	so my thinking is that maybe there is a setting somewhere that aligns text in the chat box, and its not playing nice when the screen is occupied by the nicklist and buffer list.

2015-08-19 21:56:06	isolatedvirus	He never said he did so I'm assuming he didn't. But you're right, that initial error message is due to another weechat process running.

2015-08-19 21:58:38	isolatedvirus	Linux isn't really that hard. Its more about being exposed to a ton of different things that expand your knowledge on it. I normally recommend Arch to people who are seriously interested in learning but don't want to go the LFS route.
2015-08-19 21:59:43	Lumpio-	LFS is masochistic
2015-08-19 21:59:49	Lumpio-	I use Arch these days.
2015-08-19 21:59:58	Lumpio-	Gentoo before that, lel
2015-08-19 22:00:31	isolatedvirus	But people that run Ubuntu and have only run Ubuntu usually don't understand how to compile from source, where config files usually reside or how to alter specific things unless they have a reason to be in there. In Arch, you have yo set that all up so you atleast get exposed to how to set an IP, how to modify your run levels etc.. If even only once.
2015-08-19 22:01:25	isolatedvirus	I wouldn't mind going to gentoo but having to go in and be compile something with support for other packages is overkill to me. How about compile support for all of them and if I don't have it then it doesn't work.
2015-08-19 22:03:31	isolatedvirus	I'd also need a fast machine to compile everything I wanted, and especially for an update.
2015-08-19 22:04:28	isolatedvirus	So arch is a great middle ground. I'm on Slackware these days but that's just due to its stability. I can't be rocking arch on servers.

2015-08-19 22:26:24	isolatedvirus	Yeah that counts as the framebuffer.
2015-08-19 22:26:44	isolatedvirus	Ok. So to be triple sure. As root run : killall weechat
2015-08-19 22:26:50	stallmen	i already did that
2015-08-19 22:26:59	stallmen	it said theres no weechat
2015-08-19 22:27:02	isolatedvirus	Ok awesome.
2015-08-19 22:27:12	stallmen	the problem is the permissions
2015-08-19 22:27:19	stallmen	i should've just googled how to chmod lol
2015-08-19 22:27:25	isolatedvirus	Where is the .weechat directory located?
2015-08-19 22:27:29	stallmen	~
2015-08-19 22:27:33	isolatedvirus	Chmod won't fix it.

2015-08-19 22:28:16	stallmen	its ~/.weechat

2015-08-19 22:28:46	isolatedvirus	Then run pwd
2015-08-19 22:28:53	isolatedvirus	What's the full path?
2015-08-19 22:28:58	stallmen	 /home/user
2015-08-19 22:29:26	stallmen	i moved the .weechat directory
2015-08-19 22:29:27	stallmen	somewhere
2015-08-19 22:29:31	stallmen	and now i moved it back
2015-08-19 22:29:32	isolatedvirus	Ok so its /home/user/.weechat ?
2015-08-19 22:29:40	stallmen	i already explained that
2015-08-19 22:29:49	stallmen	yes
2015-08-19 22:30:14	isolatedvirus	I'm confirming everything before I tell you to do something you don't have to. Measure twice cut once kind of thing.
2015-08-19 22:30:34	isolatedvirus	Ok run ls -al .weechat

2015-08-19 22:31:25	stallmen	yeah i moved my whole home actually
2015-08-19 22:31:28	stallmen	and moved it back
2015-08-19 22:31:30	isolatedvirus	Your weechat.log is owned by root.
2015-08-19 22:31:55	stallmen	give me acommand
2015-08-19 22:31:58	stallmen	its all i wanted
2015-08-19 22:32:20	isolatedvirus	The problem is the command isn't useful unless you know what user and group needs to own it.
2015-08-19 22:32:49	isolatedvirus	If you can figure that out its: chown -R insertdirectoryhere
2015-08-19 22:33:04	isolatedvirus	You will most likely have to run that command as root
2015-08-19 22:33:44	stallmen	then it says its missing an operand after the directory
2015-08-19 22:33:45	isolatedvirus	Ex: sudo chown -R stallmen:stallmen /home/user/.weechat

2015-08-19 22:34:17	stallmen	im confused
2015-08-19 22:34:31	stallmen	why does it need stallmen:stallmen
2015-08-19 22:34:48	isolatedvirus	Run this: ls -al /home
2015-08-19 22:35:23	isolatedvirus	What's the output?
2015-08-19 22:35:41	stallmen	drwxr-xr-x 28 arch arch  4096 Aug 19 18:25 arch
2015-08-19 22:36:11	isolatedvirus	Ok so your hone directory is /home/arch?
2015-08-19 22:36:19	stallmen	yes
2015-08-19 22:37:01	isolatedvirus	Run this command as root: chown -R arch:arch /home/arch/.weechat
2015-08-19 22:37:27	stallmen	wait
2015-08-19 22:37:35	stallmen	but every single file in ~ is owned by root

2015-08-19 22:37:47	stallmen	nvm
2015-08-19 22:38:00	isolatedvirus	Instead of /home/arch/.weechat do /home/arch

2015-08-20 01:26:42	janicez	[Global Message] I am currently in the process of developing the Troutfin IRC services program. Any input would be highly, highly appreciated. The only hard-and-fast rule is that the services program has pretty much no core (i.e. just enough to pass callbacks between modules and handle sockets) and is driven by a handful of modules.

2015-08-20 12:29:19	@nils_2	when filter is enabled, the filtered lines will be hidden

2015-08-20 12:30:31	@nils_2	for me its annoying to have all those join/part/quit messages. therefore i am using the filter to hide them
2015-08-20 12:31:34	Zarthus	it kinda sucks (but in a good way?) that filter still has those messages present though. My server buffer is flooded with hidden notices, so my server buffer is always completely empty because of filtered messages filling the buffer :X
2015-08-20 12:31:45	flaf	So, nils_2, if I understand well, the line are hidden (indeed I filter some line because I don't want to so "foo has joined" etc.) but theses hidden lines are taken into account in the parameter weechat.history.max_buffer_lines_number. Is it correct?
2015-08-20 12:32:01	flaf	*want to see...
2015-08-20 12:32:08	Zarthus	flaf: yes
2015-08-20 12:32:16	Zarthus	once you remove the filter the messages are back again
2015-08-20 12:33:01	@nils_2	yes. filtered lines are *legal* lines and will be count.
2015-08-20 12:33:39	@nils_2	btw flaf, you should upgrade your weechat to latest stable version (1.3). v1.0.1 is outdated ;-)
2015-08-20 12:35:18	flaf	Ah... shit! Now that's clear. Thx Zarthus and nils_2. I use the smart filter and I saw the number "MORE(XXXX)" to know the number of line in my buffer. And I have used this "XXXX" number to chose the value of weechat.history.max_buffer_lines_number but my reference was wrong... Ok... Ok. ;)
2015-08-20 12:35:49	purpleears	nils_2: doesnt appear to be an option to remove it
2015-08-20 12:36:04	flaf	With smart filter I had ~ 4000 lines but without 20 000 and boum !!! ;)

2015-08-20 15:33:10	sim642	because the error comes from much lower from the networking APIs than weechat itself

2015-08-21 11:40:54	sim642	the underlying problem with the no-op color code is that weechat has color/attr resets after most things it prints

2015-08-21 22:22:50	auk	i see the disclaimer on the website on the script page, but i assume there's a distinction between community scripts and "featured" scripts or something

2015-08-21 23:21:50	gb	never type the binding manually though use alt k to check your term or os is not swallowing key

2015-08-21 23:34:09	strayPuppy	and plugins are more closely integrated to the core.
2015-08-21 23:34:55	gb	and another bonus when plugins are unloaded all settings go with it so /iset has less rubbish in it
2015-08-21 23:35:41	gb	with scripts they remain even if you deleted the script and did 20 upgrades without it

2015-08-21 23:37:19	gb	not really just how scripts/plugins work hard for a script to rm settings if its not running anymore and sometimes you might just be upgrading so you don't want to trash the settings

2015-08-27 12:11:14	sim642	although I personally don't, but people use all kinds of copy buffer handling and programs and whatnot
2015-08-27 12:12:23	sim642	I think you could create a simple script instead of a plugin
2015-08-27 12:12:35	sim642	because the hsignals for quoting in cursor mode should be hookable

2015-08-27 12:14:05	sim642	it doesn't have anything selectionlike so I'm guessing you can't
2015-08-27 12:14:12	qstrahl	I think I could implement this if I can make click+drag start cursor mode and quote all messages I drag over... dunno how viable that is though.
2015-08-27 12:14:54	sim642	cursor mode does something much deeper than just copying the characters onscreen
2015-08-27 12:15:04	stfn	qstrahl: unfortunately just single messages

2015-08-29 12:40:17	sjohnson	i don't see a .deb for "weechat" itself, just the things like -core, -plugin, etc.
2015-08-29 12:40:28	sjohnson	i do, however, see: weechat_1.3.tar.gz
2015-08-29 12:40:31	sjohnson	but, not in deb format.  *confused*
2015-08-29 12:40:41	sjohnson	maybe i might just wait for apt-get upgrade to see the new packages.

2015-08-29 12:44:04	sjohnson	in other words, i expected a "weechat-1.3_armhf.deb" in there.
2015-08-29 12:44:34	sjohnson	i'm comparing the debs to what apt-get claims was held back:

2015-08-29 12:44:48	sjohnson	i see .deb's for the latter 3, not "weechat" itself.  and am getting confused.

2015-08-29 12:53:26	Mikaela	de-vri-es: from what I understood the question was how to have channel buffers under relevant server buffers and as far as I am aware the way to do that is to 1. adjust that option 2. install autosort.py
2015-08-29 12:53:27	Mikaela	de-vri-es: for the record, I do use autosort.py, but I have that option set to merge_without_core as I am not bothered by not having server buffers everywhere.

2015-08-29 12:59:46	Zarthus	jessie is newer than wheezy
2015-08-29 12:59:50	Mikaela	it calls jessy as stable and wheezy as oldstable from here

2015-08-29 13:01:37	Zarthus	you can still manually dist-upgrade I think?

(not join/part, and not just when my name is said)

2015-09-19 10:51:20	Dankewe	I just found the commands on a forum while searching for a fix.
2015-09-19 10:51:32	tomboy64	ehhh ...
2015-09-19 10:52:24	tomboy64	Dankewe: what does your /etc/apt/sources.list look like?
2015-09-19 10:53:10	tomboy64	e.g. did you just add  "deb https://weechat.org/ubuntu utopic main" ?
2015-09-19 10:55:16	tomboy64	_`_: -f is ubuntu's broken way to fix broken deps.
2015-09-19 10:55:26	tomboy64	binary distros are pure evil in that regard
2015-09-19 10:55:40	Dankewe	No I didn't.
2015-09-19 10:55:51	Dankewe	Everything is the default.
2015-09-19 10:56:30	tomboy64	Dankewe: so you have a virgin ubuntu install now?
2015-09-19 10:56:38	Dankewe	Yeah pretty much.
2015-09-19 10:56:53	Dankewe	Except for the commands I did early and now I have WeeChat installed.
2015-09-19 10:57:20	Dankewe	Running in tmux if that is the right terminology.
2015-09-19 10:57:34	tomboy64	it is
2015-09-19 10:57:52	tomboy64	but how did you install it when you didn't add the repo to your ubuntu?
2015-09-19 10:58:30	kairos	It's not included in Ubuntu's main repos?
2015-09-19 10:58:37	Dankewe	sudo bash -c "echo 'deb https://weechat.org/ubuntu trusty main' >/etc/apt/sources.list.d/weechat.list"
2015-09-19 10:59:13	Dankewe	Maybe I skipped over it, my session is lagging quite a bit.
2015-09-19 10:59:44	Dankewe	The WeeChat version installed is 1.3 so I'm not complaining.
2015-09-19 11:00:15	tomboy64	Dankewe: then you did add the repo.
2015-09-19 11:00:35	tomboy64	kairos: apparently not. lots of good software isn't.
2015-09-19 11:01:00	Dankewe	And a lot of the time it's outdated too.
2015-09-19 11:01:19	kairos	Damn it Ubuntu
2015-09-19 11:01:22	Dankewe	At least from my limited experience.
2015-09-19 11:02:29	Dankewe	tomboy64: Yeah I must have added it but didn't see it in sources.list.
2015-09-19 11:02:34	tomboy64	kairos: it's not in debians repos either
2015-09-19 11:03:05	tomboy64	Dankewe:  sudo bash -c "echo 'deb https://weechat.org/ubuntu trusty main' >/etc/apt/sources.list.d/weechat.list"
2015-09-19 11:03:06	kairos	I think it's in Fedora's
2015-09-19 11:03:10	tomboy64	this means you added it
2015-09-19 11:03:16	farn	huh, weechat is in debian's and ubuntu's repos
2015-09-19 11:03:23	tomboy64	kairos: it's in gentoo's, too
2015-09-19 11:03:45	tomboy64	farn: then why are there separate debian/ubuntu repos on weechat's homepage?

2015-09-19 11:04:06	_`_	tomboy64: because umbongo and debian are behind
2015-09-19 11:04:06	farn	tomboy64: so that debian and ubuntu users can get the latest version
2015-09-19 11:04:18	Dankewe	^
2015-09-19 11:04:19	_`_	tomboy64: they have like 0.4.3 or something
2015-09-19 11:04:41	tomboy64	farn: that doesn't count as "in debian's/ubuntu's repos" then :p
2015-09-19 11:04:48	_`_	why not?
2015-09-19 11:04:49	farn	what
2015-09-19 11:05:06	_`_	weechat IS in their repos, just not the latest version

2015-09-19 11:05:22	farn	most distros are not rolling release

2015-09-23 14:29:19	grawity	because if you go with RFC 2812 (which /doesn't/ supersede 1459 in practice), they're called 'usermode' and 'unused'
2015-09-23 14:29:42	grawity	where the 'usermode' is usually 0 or 8 or something such (one bit is defined for +i which everyone sets anyway, one for +w)
2015-09-23 14:29:48	grawity	and the unused one is usually "*"

2015-09-23 17:18:21	nkaretnikov_	another question
2015-09-23 17:18:29	sim642	but if you have plenty of channels it's not gonna fit anyway...
2015-09-23 17:19:20	nkaretnikov_	if i'm trying to paste multiple lines, weechat warns me, which is nice, but can't it expand the input area instead, so i could see the lines in question?

2015-09-23 17:19:57	@nils_2	thevishy: this should give you an idea : https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4616166/hdata_update.py
2015-09-23 17:19:58		[ http://is.gd/Jm7K1M ]
2015-09-23 17:20:01	sim642	it's possible to disable the warning and allow input bar to take up multiple lines
2015-09-23 17:20:09	sim642	but if it contains newlines they will get sent I think
2015-09-23 17:20:09	xenos	Hey guys, is there a way to change the timestamp format displayed in the channel window?
2015-09-23 17:20:15	sim642	so it won't help you much
2015-09-23 17:20:19	@nils_2	xenos: sure

2015-09-23 17:20:46	@nils_2	oh, come on sim642 :-)
2015-09-23 17:21:48	nkaretnikov_	farn: neat, i'll give it  a shot
2015-09-23 17:21:52	nkaretnikov_	thanks all!
2015-09-23 17:22:00	thevishy	ok thanks nils_2 that will give me a basic idea of weechat scripting as well
2015-09-23 17:22:44	@nils_2	hdata() is a bit tricky ;-)

2015-09-25 15:08:41	Aerdan	so I encountered an interesting error condition today: apparently weechat doesn't think to try a different server if bind() fails (e.g. I have a network set to bind to an IPv6 address and I guess the server weechat's been trying isn't reachable via IPv6 right now).

2015-09-25 15:15:53	grawity	I...don't see how "server weechat's been trying is not reachable" can cause a bind() failure?
2015-09-25 15:16:27	Aerdan	well, I happen to know the server I was attempting to connect is having hardware problems right now.
2015-09-25 15:16:30	Aerdan	09:29:58         furnet      -- │ irc: connecting to server coyote.furnet.org/6667...

2015-09-25 15:16:44	Aerdan	↑ is an example failure.
2015-09-25 15:16:58	grawity	how do you know the bind() failure is caused by the server being down though
2015-09-25 15:17:06	grawity	or vice versa
2015-09-25 15:17:24	grawity	bind() only deals with local addresses, way before Weechat even tries to connect
2015-09-25 15:17:26	Aerdan	because I'm connected to another server on the same network using the same IPv6 address it was bind()ing to for that one?
2015-09-25 15:17:55	Aerdan	for that matter I've set weechat to use that IPv6 address on every server I'm on which supports IPv6.
2015-09-25 15:18:23	Aerdan	if there were a local failure affecting my IPv6 connectivity I'd know. ;)
2015-09-25 15:23:20	grawity	I was going to ask for a strace but that ";)" just calls for an ICMP Facepunch instead
2015-09-25 15:23:26	satmd	but bind() *is* a local problem with no exception possible

2015-09-26 19:19:13	freaj	Hello everybody, I'm having an issue with the completion.py plugin, on /completion I have the list of completions, in the comment it is said to set "/set weechat.completion.default_template "%%(nicks)|%%(irc_channels)|%%(%(completion)s)"" but then, it works with only one % (like.. %(nicks) instead) and the completion doesn't work with my own completions. The script is from 2010.. Anybody who is using it and
2015-09-26 19:19:15	freaj	can help me or should I just drop the plugin? Thanks!
2015-09-26 19:20:29	strayPuppy	works for me, but it's been so long since I set it up, I prob. couldn't tell you.
2015-09-26 19:22:45	strayPuppy	my template looks like:  "%(nicks)|%(irc_channels)|%(completion_script)"

2015-09-27 13:30:34	sim642	that'd hide both

2015-09-27 13:34:43	viccuad	sim642: thanks; that was a simpler approach :)
2015-09-27 13:34:52	Nicd-	you can set autojoin with autojoin.py, it will add all current channels to autojoin
2015-09-27 13:35:19	m1klos	Nicd-: yes thanks but i ask about i want i have many server opened and channels so that to restore after quit
2015-09-27 13:35:19	Ratler	nils_2: hmm I actually have a version of that script that can tweak tiemstamps, but it seems I never actually released it :)

2015-09-27 13:37:40	m1klos	hm?
2015-09-27 13:37:49	m1klos	how i can save opened server?
2015-09-27 13:37:57	@nils_2	simply save config when weechat quit (should be on by default!)
2015-09-27 13:38:10	Nicd-	unless he opened them as temporary servers
2015-09-27 13:38:20	m1klos	yes

2015-09-27 13:39:03	viccuad	ok, setting the buffer_time_format inside of a trigger is not so easy, since my time format is "${color:252}%H${color:245}%M${color:240}%S"
2015-09-27 13:39:15	@nils_2	thats the aim of temporary server. how should weechat know that you want to save the server if you're using temporary server?
2015-09-27 13:39:22	sim642	viccuad, you can still have that in the trigger
2015-09-27 13:39:36	sim642	make it: /mute eval set ... ...
2015-09-27 13:39:38	m1klos	nils_2: u know autoconnect.py how works?
2015-09-27 13:40:20	sim642	viccuad, nevermind, no need for that eval
2015-09-27 13:40:20	@nils_2	thats not the same m1klos. if you're using TEMPORARY server, the server will not be saved!!!!
2015-09-27 13:40:35	sim642	viccuad, does it not work?
2015-09-27 13:40:37	m1klos	yes but
2015-09-27 13:40:45	m1klos	im lazy to save all server
2015-09-27 13:40:47	m1klos	lol
2015-09-27 13:40:50	sim642	...
2015-09-27 13:41:05	sim642	create it once, be fine ever after
2015-09-27 13:41:13	@nils_2	use /server add and set autoconnect option to "off"
2015-09-27 13:41:19	sim642	manually connecting to temporary servers is much more work
2015-09-27 13:41:38	viccuad	sim642: nope, I can't get it. I'm using: "/bar show nicklist; /eval set weechat.look.buffer_time_format "${color:252}%H${color:245}%M${color:240}%S""
2015-09-27 13:41:54	sim642	viccuad, without the eval
2015-09-27 13:41:58	m1klos	so that not possible with connect command after save current servers?
2015-09-27 13:42:03	sim642	use \" \" around in the string
2015-09-27 13:42:16	sim642	you need to escape the inner quotes
2015-09-27 13:42:43	sim642	viccuad, I forgot that buffer_time_format is evaluated
2015-09-27 13:42:55	sim642	item_time_format is the one which is not
2015-09-27 13:43:18	viccuad	sim642: sadly that escape doesn't work, it displays the \" in the time format (and displays numbers instead of the colors)
2015-09-27 13:43:44	m1klos	;]
2015-09-27 13:43:51	sim642	viccuad, but just remove the inner "" then
2015-09-27 13:43:52	@nils_2	its not possible. TEMPORARY is temporary and will not be saved. you have to "keep" the temporary server
2015-09-27 13:44:12	@nils_2	+manually
2015-09-27 13:44:13	Ratler	https://github.com/Ratler/ratlers-weechat-scripts/blob/master/responsive_layout.py   anyway that's the script that can tweak time_format per layout/size

2015-09-27 13:44:29	m1klos	nils_2: you know with autojoin its same so there not have saved too server and can save channels
2015-09-27 13:44:31	m1klos	hm
2015-09-27 13:44:35	m1klos	then server why not?
2015-09-27 13:44:42	@nils_2	its *not* the same
2015-09-27 13:45:09	m1klos	nils_2: so if i want i need add all server manually?
2015-09-27 13:45:18	viccuad	sim642: but with no inner "" then I get things like 252172454424049, instead of 184552 (in different colors per 2)
2015-09-27 13:45:30	@nils_2	please read /help server and /help connect m1klos

2015-09-27 13:45:53	@nils_2	no
2015-09-27 13:46:04	m1klos	nils_2: ok :)
2015-09-27 13:46:41	@nils_2	a temporary server will be lost after quitting. thats the aim of a temporary server. if you want to save the server you have to use /server add.
2015-09-27 13:47:02	@nils_2	or /server keep  if you added a temporary server
2015-09-27 13:47:22	sim642	viccuad, what if you escape the $ signs
2015-09-27 13:47:53	sim642	because it might be evaluating them in the trigger command
2015-09-27 13:47:54	@nils_2	but a *temporary* server will not be saved by default. its useless and stupid to save a temporary server by default
2015-09-27 13:47:56	sim642	not setting them

2015-09-27 13:49:09	viccuad	sim642: I can't escape the $, it just makes the \ show, that's all

2015-09-27 13:52:14	sim642	what I just said works for me
2015-09-27 13:52:23	sim642	put \ before each ${color
2015-09-27 13:54:11	viccuad	sim642: oh god it works. I escaped the $H $M $S instead
2015-09-27 13:54:18	viccuad	sim642: many thanks! I'm ashamed now
2015-09-27 13:54:24	sim642	those are %H etc, not $H ;)
2015-09-27 13:54:35	viccuad	aaand true
2015-09-27 13:54:54	sim642	escaping the $ prevents trigger from evaluating the colors but instead sends them to set directly
2015-09-27 13:55:00	sim642	which handles the evaluation for the settings
2015-09-27 13:55:07	viccuad	nice. I was going to ask why it works xD
2015-09-27 13:55:13	viccuad	many thanks again :)

2015-10-01 20:22:40	TasteyLettuce	Is there a way to make channel notices stop appearing in server buffers?

2015-10-01 20:23:11	choki	?
2015-10-01 20:23:14	TasteyLettuce	For example... if someone does /notice <channel> <message> instead of having to go to the server buffer, it shows up in the channel itself?
2015-10-01 20:23:21	TasteyLettuce	choki Yeah.
2015-10-01 20:24:33	TasteyLettuce	Because tbh, it gets annoying to constantly have to go from channel buffer to server buffer all the time.
2015-10-01 20:24:37	choki	TasteyLettuce: im sorry i dont have any answer to your question, but you may ask nils_2  he knows alot!
2015-10-01 20:25:23	strayPuppy	TasteyLettuce: I think you can redirect them to a pv buffer, look at: /help irc.look.notice_as_pv
2015-10-01 20:25:26	choki	TasteyLettuce: i know what you mean, i do the same again for example if i need to /whois someone. this is annyong :'(

2015-10-01 20:28:16	choki	so you'd have to: /set irc.msgbuffer.* current ?

2015-10-01 20:29:02	gb	there is a default setting for everything from memory

2015-10-02 12:24:49	^^nidan^^	this isn't necessarily a weechat question but maybe someone has advice, I use weechat through screen connected to a remote shell account. I'm being disconnected often (ssh disconnects), however I have another ssh session that doesn't get disconnected (only the one on IRC gets DC'd), any idea why? Am I joined to too many channels maybe? (~10)
2015-10-02 12:26:59	Zarthus	10 channels certainly isn't "too much"
2015-10-02 12:27:44	Zarthus	could be distance between you and the ssh server with a wonky provider. It might be useful (but I won't claim to know how exactly) to provide traceroutes to both servers
2015-10-02 12:28:19	Petzku	^^nidan^^: You have weechat running in an ssh session being run inside screen?

2015-10-02 12:44:14	^^nidan^^	would the ISP that I have the shell service from be able to check anything in their logs about the disconnects if I ask them?
2015-10-02 12:45:02	Zarthus	i don't think so
2015-10-02 12:45:16	Zarthus	traceroutes might help, as i said

2015-10-02 12:45:37	Zarthus	i personally don't have the problem with weechat, using a similar setup
2015-10-02 12:46:08	Zarthus	but yeah - if it's all the same servers I'd think it's more of an idle timeout rather than actually a network derp
2015-10-02 12:46:10	^^nidan^^	thanks I'll try some traces or winmtr
2015-10-02 12:47:14	Zarthus	it could be that your isp doesn't like the constant open traffic has and forcibly disconnects you i  suppose - but that's sometimes that's more of a guess than a statement.

2015-10-05 11:52:50	cgt	Well it's not a problem with weechat you're asking about.
2015-10-05 11:53:05	collyrium	^^
2015-10-05 11:53:07	cgt	You're asking about your terminal emulator.
2015-10-05 11:54:06	cgt	But you can probably select text with your cursor and right click -> click copy in the context menu (if that's how your term emulator works)

2015-10-07 20:51:39	armin	i just think the way irssi does it really makes sense here, even if i disagree with most things of irssi nowadays.
2015-10-07 20:52:16	armin	well, the Act: display default of irssi is what i have in mind, of course that's pretty much configurable and whatnot.
2015-10-07 20:53:03	armin	maybe that's just due to the fact that irssi still had the requirement of being useful with a lot of channels on 80x25 displays.
2015-10-07 20:53:23	armin	and maybe i'm tempted because i actually had a vt100 on my toilet.

2015-10-11 17:40:15	owen1	is there a config file i use instead of doing things manualy?
2015-10-11 17:40:35	owen1	i would like to put in that config/script every command i need to run.

2015-10-11 17:43:11	owen1	think of vim. i can share my .vimrc with anyone easily.
2015-10-11 17:43:31	ralpheeee	can some1 pls help...would like to copy text from irc channel...but mouse wont select??
2015-10-11 17:43:34	owen1	and it's easy to put .vimrc in a git repo.
2015-10-11 17:43:44	tristero	my buffer bar is now showing the "bar_more_left" arrow instead of the two servers (freenode and oftc) that I'm using.  I've never seen that before; did I type something by accident to "abbreviate" them somehow?

2015-10-11 17:45:58	strayPuppy	not supposed too, owen1

2015-10-11 17:46:14	sim642	if you mess something up, anything could happen
2015-10-11 17:46:25	strayPuppy	or you can use the /reload command after you make a change

2015-10-11 17:46:59	sim642	you should only need to modify them directly when you mess something up real bad

2015-10-11 17:48:18	owen1	sim642: users do. not programms.
2015-10-11 17:48:27	sim642	yeah, but weechat modifies its own configs
2015-10-11 17:48:32	owen1	i add a line to my .vimrc, open vim and observe.
2015-10-11 17:48:45	squirrel	weechat isn't very linux-y
2015-10-11 17:48:46	@nils_2	and using /set or /iset the value will be checked
2015-10-11 17:49:29	@nils_2	and at least you'll save our time if you mess up your config by editing manually owen1 :p
2015-10-11 17:49:35	owen1	ok. what i'll do is use iset and close weechat and reopen it to make sure it's actualy working.

2015-10-11 17:52:06	sim642	owen1, there's a pull request of mine to buffer_autoset which applies immediately ;)

2015-10-11 17:55:00	joshu42	Hello ! ;) I assume we have to set a proxy if we don't want our full hostname to be displayed on join, right ?
2015-10-11 17:55:03	owen1	strayPuppy: yup but it doesn't persist without buffer_autoset
2015-10-11 17:55:05	strayPuppy	works with the channel name if you do it in the buffer you want to change

2015-10-11 17:55:36	owen1	is that a bug or by design?
2015-10-11 17:55:40	owen1	why wouldn't it
2015-10-11 17:55:51	sim642	it's by design I'd say
2015-10-11 17:56:00	owen1	interesting decision
2015-10-11 17:56:03	sim642	buffer variables are not options as such

2015-10-11 17:58:11	@nils_2	/buffer_autoset is a script to make buffer vars persistent. but you have to add the variable + value using the script, see /help autosetbuffer
2015-10-11 17:58:14	owen1	so i have bunch of #general
2015-10-11 17:59:19	*	strayPuppy hates when the /commandname is different than the script name.
2015-10-11 17:59:43	sim642	isn't there a script policy forcing it to be the same?
2015-10-11 17:59:46	owen1	strayPuppy: agree

2015-10-11 20:47:53	Zarthus	you can close it in this active buffer and rejoin it using '/join #weechat'

2015-10-12 18:27:31	lunchdump	so in javascript theres no natural keyword to "include" or "require" a file from the filesystem like you can in python for example
2015-10-12 18:28:22	lunchdump	but i would like this functionality similar to NodeJS's require function, so i may use 3rd party libraries when writing scripts for weechat
2015-10-12 18:30:17	@nils_2	the plugin (javascript, perl, python) is an api. you don't have additional functions, like for example file handling.
2015-10-12 18:31:32	lunchdump	but perl, python, etc, their compilers have keywords that allow you to import files, right?
2015-10-12 18:32:54	@nils_2	the script has to handle it, for example in perl "use URI::Find;" or python "import time".

2015-10-13 13:08:15	sim642	because that's an argument, not a command
2015-10-13 13:08:31	sim642	partial_completion_command_arg would change that

2015-10-13 13:08:57	sim642	which can be annoying

2015-10-13 15:16:29	sim642	a lot of the time it also hasn't been worth implementing weird protocols because bitlbee kind of can handle those

The PPA build complains about my GnuTLS version being too old, so I installed the apt package 'libgnutls28-dev' and compiled my own binary with the CMake option 'GNUTLS_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgnutls.so.28' - still the same error. Would somebody please be so kind as to enlighten me about what I am doing

2015-10-22 12:41:57	sandah	Well I was going to put it on a fedora or ubuntu box which has access to later builds so I can update it easily. It's just so much easier than irssi. :)
2015-10-22 12:42:23	StolenToast	debian and redhat based distros also have old packages
2015-10-22 12:42:34	StolenToast	in fact I think on Buntu you might get downgraded

2015-10-22 12:43:00	sandah	It looks like ubuntu with the ppa and fedora both have 1.3.1
2015-10-22 12:43:07	StolenToast	it might be the one in the RH family to have an updated weechat package

2015-10-22 20:40:18	purpleidea	how do you actually do this? since alt-backspace (once configured) eats through words that contain - _ etc... instead of stopping there as is common in readline, etc...

2015-10-25 11:22:30	sim642	but instead of having to scroll through the results
2015-10-25 11:22:36	sim642	it only shows matching lines in the first place
2015-10-25 11:22:52	sim642	although if you want it to go beyond your scrollback, you'll have to use grep.py

2015-10-25 11:35:00	Fearful	yes
2015-10-25 11:35:09	sim642	how would it work in the current buffer?
2015-10-25 11:35:18	Fearful	just print it to the current buffer?
2015-10-25 11:35:22	Fearful	should be simple..
2015-10-25 11:35:32	sim642	it'd create such a mess though
2015-10-25 11:35:36	Fearful	irssi does it
2015-10-25 11:35:43	Fearful	surely you can get it to work on weechat
2015-10-25 11:35:45	sim642	actual lines mixed with some script output
2015-10-25 11:35:52	Fearful	bleh
2015-10-25 11:35:53	sim642	you can, but there might be a reason weechat doesn't
2015-10-25 11:35:54	Fearful	idc
2015-10-25 11:36:36	Fearful	i'll just mess with it until it works
2015-10-25 11:36:38	sim642	if you do, you could add an option to the script to control that
2015-10-25 11:36:44	sim642	and the make a pull request
2015-10-25 11:36:52	sim642	because other people might like that too
2015-10-25 11:37:11	FBDragon	Hi guys, I set up a shell account and I'm setting it up. I'm having trouble with notifications
2015-10-25 11:37:20	FBDragon	I used the notification center script before, as I'm from OS X
2015-10-25 11:37:31	FBDragon	how can I possibly get notifications still?
2015-10-25 11:38:06	sim642	you are ssh-ing into your shell server?
2015-10-25 11:38:49	FBDragon	sorry if I didn't point it out, much of a newbie tbh
2015-10-25 11:38:52	FBDragon	yes I am!
2015-10-25 11:38:53	sim642	I don't think there's any way to get notifications over ssh
2015-10-25 11:39:01	sim642	other than the basic terminal bell
2015-10-25 11:39:09	FBDragon	I would like the basic terminal bell
2015-10-25 11:39:09	Fearful	too long to add features like that and I don't remember enough python
2015-10-25 11:39:12	Fearful	i'll just hack it to work
2015-10-25 11:39:33	sim642	FBDragon, then make sure your terminal supports that and has it turned on
2015-10-25 11:39:58	sim642	and it should work if you have the beep trigger enabled
2015-10-25 11:40:01	FBDragon	On my side I have terminal.app
2015-10-25 11:41:39	Fearful	guess I don't really need it.. waste of time, but either way I'll keep hacking it until it works
2015-10-25 11:41:41	Fearful	thanks anyway :P

2015-10-25 11:43:03	sim642	I have desktop notifications anyway
2015-10-25 11:43:30	Evropi	same, I set up kde to give desktop notifications about it
2015-10-25 11:44:04	sim642	I just have a super hacky trigger to fire libnotify
2015-10-25 11:44:09	sim642	instead of using any script :P
2015-10-25 11:44:22	sim642	I once challenged myself to do it with a trigger and got it to work
2015-10-25 11:44:29	sim642	and it was decent enough to keep using, so why not
2015-10-25 11:45:53	Evropi	over ssh though sim642?
2015-10-25 11:47:06	FBDragon	so if I swith to the ssh
2015-10-25 11:47:16	FBDragon	and type that printf \\a like this http://puu.sh/kX2Ro/d3d613997b.png

2015-10-25 13:52:07	isene	For some odd reason, I cannot mark text with doubleclick or insert with middleclick anymore (some paste caused this). I connect to weechat via ssh to one of my servers. When I middleclick now, I get into a weird mode where I get a cursor I can move around the whole screen. Shift-Insert still works, though as an alternative to middleclick. I have tried reconnecting via ssh, but this issue remains. Any ideas

2015-10-28 11:49:22	abyxcos	Fearful: There's some other get_* methods if it's a different data type.
2015-10-28 11:50:03	abyxcos	qstrahl: Not at the moment. But shift will allow you to select text.
2015-10-28 11:50:18	abyxcos	Fearful: And that is a pointer.
2015-10-28 11:50:54	qstrahl	abyxcos, Close enough, I suppose. Thanks!
2015-10-28 11:52:27	gb	no because some mouse things change depending on your term
2015-10-28 11:52:31	abyxcos	qstrahl: You can also unbind the motions you don't want.

2015-10-28 11:54:01	abyxcos	qstrahl: More specifically, shift will pass mouse events directly to the terminal. I'm not sure how those actually chain with other listeners.
2015-10-28 11:54:34	abyxcos	/key unbindctxt bind, I forget how to list the mouse mode specific ones though.
2015-10-28 11:54:50	gb	read /help key
2015-10-28 11:54:51	abyxcos	That's in the manual somewhere.
2015-10-28 11:55:04	gb	it has examples
2015-10-28 11:56:21	gb	weechat cannot change what the term does to the mouse hwever and this is explained in the docs

2015-10-28 12:23:40	yeled	anyone got a hint about why emoji is being stripped from irc -> weechat -> iterm?
2015-10-28 12:23:48	yeled	if i use glowing-bear, i can see the emoji
2015-10-28 12:23:54	yeled	i wonder what my term is doing wrong
2015-10-28 12:25:04	Evropi	I think glowing bear uses a library to render emoji
2015-10-28 12:25:31	squirrel	qstrahl: I use a simple automation script on windows that presses shift for me in terminal window
2015-10-28 12:25:51	Evropi	oh nvm yeled it's part of the browser
2015-10-28 12:25:54	squirrel	I don't know if linux can easily do that
2015-10-28 12:26:17	Evropi	yeled: you need to ask iterm developers do add support for it it seems, as it's unicode now
2015-10-28 12:26:17	qstrahl	squirrel, I have great mouse support in most of my terminal applications, so I don't really want to send the mouse events directly to the terminal if I can avoid it
2015-10-28 12:26:32	yeled	iterm does it..
2015-10-28 12:26:35	yeled	ill experiment
2015-10-28 12:26:37	Evropi	though there are workarounds which use icons locally
2015-10-28 12:26:42	Evropi	at least in browsers
2015-10-28 12:26:44	*	Evropi uses glowing-bear too
2015-10-28 12:27:08	yeled	glowing bear can render, or just pass through
2015-10-28 12:27:09	yeled	i thik
2015-10-28 12:27:10	Evropi	but yeah, android supports emoji system wide for instance so all apps have emoji support basically out the boxto my knowledge
2015-10-28 12:28:26	Nicd-	yeled: I have a blog post about how to enable emoji

2015-11-02 11:29:04	itai86	I'm trying to get a js running
2015-11-02 11:29:12	itai86	it's in a folder I downloaded from github
2015-11-02 11:29:17	itai86	do I just extract it into the weechat folder?
2015-11-02 11:29:34	Tyranic-Moron	toogley: it shows you all the tags that messages have, so you can find out what you need to check for
2015-11-02 11:30:02	gb	toogley: it doesn't but if you wanted to script something look at the highmon.pl code as it pastes all the highlights to a buffer/bar so perhaps you could figure out where to insert a counter inside it
2015-11-02 11:30:03	Tyranic-Moron	yours just then highlighting me has notify_message, for instance
2015-11-02 11:30:04	itai86	I can't see a javascript folder in weechat, any ideas folks?
2015-11-02 11:30:09	Yaniel	itai86: first you need to check that you have the javascript plugin installed
2015-11-02 11:30:42	Yaniel	if you do, just drop the file in the corresponding folder and /script load yourscript.js
2015-11-02 11:31:05	gb	no folders in linux, maybe sumone cleaned up and put it into your filing cabinet
2015-11-02 11:31:26	itai86	aaah
2015-11-02 11:31:28	itai86	that's the problem

2015-11-02 11:33:03	itai86	what's the command
2015-11-02 11:33:24	gb	if you are looking for the directory /script install a .js and it will be created for you or you can mkdir ~/.weechat/javascript i think but better to let weechat create it along with autoload with the correct permissions

2015-11-02 11:36:39	gb	i'd say remove the offending ,!javascript line from your /iset .autoload and /upgrade to make sure it will load next time
2015-11-02 11:36:51	itai86	' /plugin load foo.js

2015-11-02 11:37:03	itai86	:)
2015-11-02 11:37:44	gb	if you have the .js in the correct place add a ln-s to it in autoload so t's automagically loaded after /upgrade or weechat startup
2015-11-02 11:38:43	gb	ie ln -s ../scriptname.js scriptname.js in the autoload directory
2015-11-02 11:39:17	gb	or if you don't want it loaded at start do not do that

2015-11-02 11:46:21	Yaniel	do you have the plugin installed in the first place?

2015-11-02 11:47:43	Yaniel	update the relevant package

2015-11-05 10:34:15	bernalex	when you're /away, weechat marks buffers with activity even if you have them open. great. but how do I mark them as not having new activity any more? what I do today is just switch to a different buffer and back. this works, but is admittedly clumsy.

2015-11-05 15:07:04	bendem	it's weird how setting buffers.look.name_size_max truncates names that fit the new width (like " 3 bouncer/espe+   │", bouncer/esper has been truncated even tho there was place for the 'r')
2015-11-05 15:07:52	gb	but it's also dependent on a buffer being set to all or highlight, if set to none there will be no change because buffer will not be added to hotlist on activity

2015-11-05 19:35:08	sim642	well yes, but if you're talking to one person directly, why would you need to even complete their nick or anything
2015-11-05 19:35:09	armin	sim642: completing the nickname inside a message to just the nickname might actually make sense, though, of course.
2015-11-05 19:35:49	sim642	I think this nickname completion in query buffers is just a side effect of it being in channel buffers

2015-11-05 19:38:22	sim642	still, what does weechat's nick completion in query buffers have to do with adding unix users?
2015-11-05 19:38:38	armin	so even in a query with you the possibility that we just speak about your weird nick sim642 (which i just tab-completed, and voila, there was NO ":" suffix, see a pattern here?) is pretty high.
2015-11-05 19:39:01	armin	are you trolling?
2015-11-05 19:39:09	sim642	the suffix only appears when you tab complete in the beginning of the message
2015-11-05 19:39:15	armin	exactly.
2015-11-05 19:39:20	armin	which makes no sense in a query.

2015-11-06 16:18:43	wikro	I've read the help for both and it's not any clearer
2015-11-06 16:18:45	sim642	FlashCode, doesn't explain much since chat_nick_colors seems to really override it
2015-11-06 16:19:01	strayPuppy	it don't do anything for me either

2016-01-30 10:32:51	indeedwatson	gb it gets pushed back to 1 when i /upgrade
2016-01-30 10:32:59	gb	this should order it at end of buffers.pl or you can merge it with core maybe ?
2016-01-30 10:33:20	gb	then hide merged buffers
2016-01-30 10:33:22	@nils_2	indeedwatson, with /layout you can store a position for a buffer. so if you /join a channel the buffer will be opened at the given /layout position
2016-01-30 10:33:49	indeedwatson	ok i'll try uninstalling autosort
2016-01-30 10:33:50	gb	i recommend you read /help layout
2016-01-30 10:34:35	gb	then you can buffer move /layout store and upgrade and it will stay the same
2016-01-30 10:34:51	AshleyKitty	x1: maybe you should write a script outside of weechat that detects the currently focused window and if it's a terminal emulator that you have weechat in then execute the command
2016-01-30 10:35:42	gb	but autosort does allow you to shift stuff around too but i do not use it, you will need to look at the available oons with /iset and read the help carefully

2016-01-30 10:36:28	@nils_2	enable renumber-option and move your server buffer to a higher number like 1000. new opened channels can be open in the gap, so they won't be opened behind the server buffers
2016-01-30 10:36:50	@nils_2	iirc all of the autosort scripts can not handle renumber
2016-01-30 10:37:23	gb	that's cause the use the numbering to sort i think

2016-01-30 10:53:25	de-vri-es	(joined a new channel, that was not enough)
2016-01-30 10:54:00	gb	depends you can add more context sensitive commands to it too utube-dl for example or wget as well as opening something in lynx
2016-01-30 10:55:32	@nils_2	does the position of buffers stay intact? thats the aim to disable renumbering. for example, my query buffers are on position >100. freenode buffers from 10-30, euirc buffers from 40-50, and so on. all of my buffers are clearly separated. what happens when i run autosort? give it a shot :-)
2016-01-30 10:56:11	gb	or maybe you could add one to sms yourself the url to view on your dumbphone :-)
2016-01-30 10:56:15	de-vri-es	nils_2: the numbers you give are ignored and the sort rules are applied instead
2016-01-30 10:56:24	de-vri-es	which is the point of the sort rules, you know
2016-01-30 10:56:53	gb	yes he said that already :-)
2016-01-30 10:57:15	@nils_2	indeed. thats what i said. script does not work correctly with renumber disabled
2016-01-30 10:57:32	de-vri-es	it does in my opinion, you'r asking conflicting things
2016-01-30 10:57:39	@nils_2	or script should not be used when you disable renumber option

2016-01-30 10:58:54	indeedwatson	well that didnt work
2016-01-30 10:58:54	gb	problem was multiple solutions were given and the person tried to use several of them :-)
2016-01-30 10:59:02	@nils_2	the script should maybe give a warning when option renumber is disabled and stop further operations
2016-01-30 10:59:04	de-vri-es	right, so please don't blame it all on autosort
2016-01-30 10:59:30	de-vri-es	fair enough, that could be an addition
2016-01-30 10:59:49	indeedwatson	de-vri-es: i tried with the sort rules and no matter what, the &bitlbee buffer stayed first

2016-02-28 14:28:33	indeedwatson	you know how you can use tags such as "red" to determine a setting's color, or you can use more custom colors by number such as "244"
2016-02-28 14:28:54	indeedwatson	is there a way to make that 244 work as the red tag, or a new tag with a new name?
2016-02-28 14:29:23	indeedwatson	so that if i use the color 244 in several settings and I want to change it, i can just change the tag
2016-02-28 14:29:42	@nils_2	a tag is something different in weechat
2016-02-28 14:29:51	@nils_2	you can alias a color number to a name
2016-02-28 14:30:06	indeedwatson	oh okay
2016-02-28 14:30:10	sim642	/help color
2016-02-28 14:30:12	@nils_2	for example: /set weechat.palette.214 "orange"
2016-02-28 14:30:23	indeedwatson	awesome, thanks
2016-02-28 14:30:36	@nils_2	or better use /color of course :-D
2016-02-28 14:30:38	sim642	nils_2, I had almost forgotten color aliasing is a thing
2016-02-28 14:30:49	sim642	also TIL there's another dynamic section of options
2016-02-28 14:30:50	@nils_2	me too :-)
2016-02-28 14:31:13	indeedwatson	I'm using /color to display them, can I somehow edit them from that buffer more easily?

2016-02-28 14:31:58	sim642	not really because it's actually displaying all color pairs, mostly the ones weechat allocates itself
2016-02-28 14:33:05	strayPuppy	help says use:  /color  alias <color> <name>
2016-02-28 14:33:51	indeedwatson	yeah i'm gonna work on that

2016-02-28 14:38:41	strayPuppy	indeedwatson: if you have tabs on your terminal, it helps to open a new tab and do: "weechat -c"  to keep your colors numbers handy when setting options.

2016-02-28 14:44:32	TreyHarris	So I got split and cloned so switched to the nick TreyHarri1. Weechat couldn't fix me because when it tried to change me back, a channel I'm on devoiced people not registered to nickserv. So I need to tell Weechat to register me to nickserv even before trying to change nicks.
2016-02-28 14:45:23	TreyHarris	I fixed it by manually identifying to nickserv, but I assume some setting will let me get weechat to do that so I don't sit with my cloak down and my nick open for 8 hours while I'm sleeping?
2016-02-28 14:46:09	@nils_2	have a look for scripts

2016-02-28 14:49:36	TreyHarris	strayPuppy: I'm hesitant to do that without human intervention. I'm rather surprised that SASL identifying to freenode doesn't get your nickserv identified regardless of nick
2016-02-28 14:50:01	TreyHarris	But looks like keepnick may do what I want
2016-02-28 14:50:41	Norbin	is there anything written for weechat and sockets / port listening ?

2016-02-28 14:52:10	strayPuppy	yeah, TreyHarris it should be automatic
2016-02-28 14:53:39	TreyHarris	strayPuppy: no, looks like both of those identify nicklessly, which won't work if a particular channel has devoiced me for not being authenticated and Freenode doesn't allow nick-changing when devoiced. but I guess I can fork one and make it do "/msg nickserv IDENTIFY $nick $password" rather than just "/msg nickserv IDENTIFY $password"

2016-03-01 18:59:47	_`_	do you shell in from an android device? if so do you have a hw keyboard? I mean I do that, but I have a phone w/a hw keyboard

2016-03-01 19:01:12	_`_	what terminal emulator / keyboard do you use, even connectbot + hacker's keyboard is not good enough
2016-03-01 19:01:20	_`_	(for me)
2016-03-01 19:01:23	f8l	meffe: I frequently use ^W to delete words, for example.
2016-03-01 19:02:10	_`_	I find it astonishing that any term emu + a virtual touch keyboard is usable enough
2016-03-01 19:02:16	meffe	Ok, well I don't think you got those bindings

2016-03-01 19:03:39	_`_	removes word
2016-03-01 19:03:43	f8l	meffe: Backspace erases a character, not a word.
2016-03-01 19:03:46	_`_	it's faster in some cases
2016-03-01 19:04:05	_`_	it's actually cutting a word for lack of a better phrase
2016-03-01 19:04:10	meffe	Still.. What ssh client do you use?
2016-03-01 19:04:27	_`_	^W would cut it /^Y would paste it back

2016-03-01 19:08:38	meffe	f8l: Alright, sorry I didn't see that. I guess connectbot must have great addons for kb.. I've used juicessh, and sure it got that kb-addon but I don't think I would be as quick to use ^W just to erase a word, and let that decide whether I should try weechat-android of  not... But hey, that's me :)
2016-03-01 19:08:47	f8l	A friend of mine gave me her Galaxy S III. Earlier I used the same on Galaxy III.
2016-03-01 19:09:21	f8l	meffe: No, it doesn’t have any add-ons. At least none that I know about.
2016-03-01 19:09:23	_`_	and you have enough space to type and get a decent viewable area of the window?

2016-03-01 19:10:41	meffe	So you change the keys by pressing a button somewhere and the press the ^ and then switch back and W? I've never used connectbot
2016-03-01 19:11:26	f8l	meffe: You seem not to understand that notation. ^W is the same as C-w.
2016-03-01 19:11:40	meffe	_`_: i didn't have just that before I setup a relay in weechat, and then used weechat-android to connect to it. Now it's golden..
2016-03-01 19:12:01	meffe	f8l: yeah? I know dude

2016-03-01 19:22:05	f8l	I think we have incompatible definitions of a widget.
2016-03-01 19:22:27	_`_	it looks like it sits on top of the active window and is transparent.
2016-03-01 19:22:56	_`_	I don't know what else to call that in GUI parlance, so widget seemed appropriate.
2016-03-01 19:23:07	f8l	It is, but it’s just an input method. You can only use it where you can input text.
2016-03-01 19:23:33	mumixam_	Canar: it should by efault
2016-03-01 19:23:40	_`_	yeah but the significant difference seemingly being it sitting on top of the active window

2016-03-01 22:02:26	kunwon1	that will show you the list
2016-03-01 22:02:29	kunwon1	and you can then change the list
2016-03-01 22:02:45	bakteria	I remember years and years ago I used putty and I changed the colour manually in settings so the colour was lighter.
2016-03-01 22:02:48	kunwon1	i find it distracting
2016-03-01 22:04:18	bakteria	I changed it in putty actually.

2016-03-01 22:24:11		jenic has joined #weechat
2016-03-01 22:28:31	haasn	kunwon1: that seems like a terminal problem to me, not a weechat problem
2016-03-01 22:29:00	haasn	also IRC colors are love, IRC colors are life: https://0x0.st/8Y1.png
2016-03-01 22:29:04	kunwon1	haasn: there are many, many terminal-based apps that don't have issues with poorly contrasting colors - because their defaults are not to change the color of things
2016-03-01 22:29:26	kunwon1	but again, i'm not asking to change the defaults, i'm just asking for it to be obvious how to turn off the colors
2016-03-01 22:29:34	kunwon1	it's not at all obvious currently
2016-03-01 22:29:37	haasn	kunwon1: As a sysadmin who tends to be exposed to dozens of different tools on a daily basis, things not having colors on by default just hurts productivity
2016-03-01 22:29:45	haasn	because colors help immensely
2016-03-01 22:30:02	kunwon1	i'm also a sysadmin and i'd say the opposite
2016-03-01 22:30:11	haasn	I don't really have the time and energy to go through the man page of every single tool I'm using and check whether it even has _support_ for colors
2016-03-01 22:30:12	kunwon1	the point is that different people have different preferences
2016-03-01 22:30:17		eh_eff has joined #weechat
2016-03-01 22:30:41	kunwon1	ffs, all i'm asking for is that it be added to the FAQ
2016-03-01 22:30:47	haasn	but if you use a color scheme that includes dark blue on black, I can agree with you
2016-03-01 22:30:50	haasn	I couldn't work with that either
2016-03-01 22:32:15	kunwon1	vim doesn't use colors by default either
2016-03-01 22:32:40	haasn	https://0x0.st/8Yj.png I don't need two seconds to decide which one is easier to read and parse
2016-03-01 22:32:50	haasn	Especially if I want to quickly find out which I have installed and which not
2016-03-01 22:32:52	kunwon1	ideally there would just be /set irc_nick_colors off
2016-03-01 22:32:53	kunwon1	or something

2016-03-01 22:33:25	kunwon1	but the second example is definitely easier
2016-03-01 22:33:34	*	haasn scratches his head in confusion
2016-03-01 22:33:37	haasn	Oh well
2016-03-01 22:33:43	indeedwatson	lol im with you haasn 
2016-03-01 22:34:09	indeedwatson	i don't understand how less color information can lead to quicker understanding
2016-03-01 22:34:15	kunwon1	it looks like a heavily modified terminal

2016-03-01 22:35:23	indeedwatson	color just helps guide your eyes to find similar patterns imo
2016-03-01 22:35:34	indeedwatson	much like spacing

2016-03-01 22:35:46	haasn	kunwon1: I only slightly modified the color scheme. The defaults were perfectly reasonable and readable on my distro
2016-03-01 22:35:58	kunwon1	your terminal uses the lambda symbol by default?
2016-03-01 22:36:02	haasn	(but I do agree that a number of distros ship unreasonable, insane color schemes by default)

2016-03-01 22:36:15	haasn	kunwon1: My terminal just displays the text it's given?
2016-03-01 22:36:22	haasn	My terminal doesn't have any symbols
2016-03-01 22:36:40	kunwon1	you know what i mean you silly goose
2016-03-01 22:36:52	haasn	also vim has colors by default too, and for a good reason: https://0x0.st/8Y_.png
2016-03-01 22:36:58	haasn	at least it did, again, on my distro
2016-03-01 22:37:23	kunwon1	then your distro is wrong
2016-03-01 22:37:30	indeedwatson	yeah my vim had colors by default on urxvt, but they were ugly
2016-03-01 22:37:41	indeedwatson	that makes no sense kunwon1 
2016-03-01 22:37:43	kunwon1	but i'm not going to get into a dick measuring contest, i've stated my request, i'll bow out of the conversation now
2016-03-01 22:38:42	haasn	I'm just confused more than anything. To me it sounds like you're saying “I can read english text easier when there are no spaces between the words”, which I would find equally baffling
2016-03-01 22:38:56	_`_	kunwon1: you mean his shell?
2016-03-01 22:39:00	haasn	Since it destroys about as much contextual information that our brain uses to quickly parse things
2016-03-01 22:39:25	haasn	indeedwatson: Blame your distro for having horrible default colors for urxvt I guess? ;p
2016-03-01 22:39:27	haasn	:p*
2016-03-01 22:40:07	indeedwatson	haasn: nah, i blamed myself for picking an urxvt scheme but not setting up the vim theme
2016-03-01 22:40:16	indeedwatson	but i already corrected that
2016-03-01 22:40:21	_`_	that's gold coming from a meem with a color scheme that looks like pumpkin vomit
2016-03-01 22:40:22	haasn	indeedwatson: fair enough
2016-03-01 22:40:29	haasn	indeedwatson: note that urxvt comes in both 88 color and 256 color flavors
2016-03-01 22:40:35	indeedwatson	i've been on a ricing spree lately
2016-03-01 22:40:44	haasn	That actually throws a _ton_ of applications off
2016-03-01 22:40:44	indeedwatson	yeah i'm using 256

2016-03-01 22:40:51		duckpupp1 has quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
2016-03-01 22:40:55	haasn	Mostly because 88 is fairly uncommon, but I still use it out of laziness
2016-03-01 22:41:25	haasn	Can't be bothered porting every program I've customized to a 256-color term :/
2016-03-01 22:41:29	indeedwatson	i was actually using 88 specifically for weechat until 2 days ago, because i couldn't figure out how to make links clickable in 256
2016-03-01 22:41:54	haasn	That seems curious. Aren't they the same terminal?
2016-03-01 22:41:59	haasn	Why would one be clickable and the other not?
2016-03-01 22:42:13	indeedwatson	_`_: afaik, nick colors are somewhat random, so it's a coincidence it looks like a pumpkin
2016-03-01 22:42:37	haasn	(Or do they get installed to different paths / use different configurations on your system?)
2016-03-01 22:42:53	_`_	idk as long as one sets 0 through 15 to something reasonable most programs should look fine
2016-03-01 22:43:04	indeedwatson	haasn: that's what i thought! but the lines that you need to add to .Xresources, you need to repeat them for URxvt256c
2016-03-01 22:43:19	indeedwatson	which is odd, cause afaik the other lines don't need to be repeated
2016-03-01 22:43:43	indeedwatson	but they use the same file
2016-03-01 22:43:50	indeedwatson	took me months to figure it out
2016-03-01 22:43:56	_`_	indeedwatson: a whole line of text is the same color in haasn's scheme
2016-03-01 22:44:32	_`_	and the colors there are all shades of colors that together make me think of pumpkin vomit
2016-03-01 22:45:02	haasn	indeedwatson: I have my colors set as *color0: #....; *color1: #....
2016-03-01 22:45:27	haasn	indeedwatson: And that makes sense. On my system, 256 and 88 color are just different flavors of the same package, I can install one or the other but not both simultaneously - and they install to the same location
2016-03-01 22:45:36	haasn	With the same executable name

2016-03-01 22:49:02	haasn	Didn't realize you could #include stuff in .Xdefaults, but then again my .Xdefaults basically only contains the colors to begin with

2016-03-01 22:49:52	indeedwatson	I use .Xresources instead, I heard against using .Xdefaults but I can't recall the explanation :p

The only reason I could think of that would be compelling enough for me to switch from .Xdefaults to .Xresources would be if the former is a security risk
