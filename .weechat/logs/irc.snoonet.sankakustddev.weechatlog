2015-11-22 23:02:23	sankakuStdDev	bruh what stats class do i take after this one
2015-11-22 23:02:35	sankakuStdDev	i'm not sure how high level the one i'm doing is
2015-11-22 23:02:42	sankakuStdDev	and if i need to go higher in stats
2015-11-22 23:02:58	sankakuStdDev	might need to jump back to calc so i can do a calc based stats class
2015-11-22 23:03:05	sankakuStdDev	or maybe i should go do machine learning
2015-11-22 23:03:10	sankakuStdDev	i don't want to waste time
2015-11-22 23:04:27	inddwtsn	i know nothing about statistics :c
2015-11-22 23:05:08	sankakuStdDev	me neither
2015-11-22 23:05:10	sankakuStdDev	relatively
2015-11-22 23:22:37	inddwtsn	does this help your job?
2015-11-22 23:24:07	sankakuStdDev	i'm going to change jobs
2015-11-22 23:24:14	inddwtsn	to what
2015-11-22 23:24:14	sankakuStdDev	if everythign goes well
2015-11-22 23:24:23	sankakuStdDev	no more web dev/software engineer
2015-11-22 23:24:40	sankakuStdDev	data science
2015-11-22 23:24:49	sankakuStdDev	i'll be a scientist nigga
2015-11-22 23:24:56	inddwtsn	why did you choose that
2015-11-22 23:24:57	sankakuStdDev	with a highschool diploma
2015-11-22 23:25:26	sankakuStdDev	cause it's cool af and i could potentially make a big difference in the world with it
2015-11-22 23:25:40	sankakuStdDev	it's programming + statistics + machine learning + domain knowledge
2015-11-22 23:28:22	inddwtsn	i thought you were gonna say to get all the bishes
2015-11-22 23:29:36	sankakuStdDev	haha that's  a byproduct
2015-11-22 23:38:43	sankakuStdDev	bruh i want to see you be a linux consultant or something like that
2015-11-22 23:39:46	inddwtsn	but i dont know how to transition or learn stuff that someone would pay me money for
2015-11-22 23:39:55	sankakuStdDev	something you're excited to tell people you do
2015-11-22 23:39:57	sankakuStdDev	and that you enjoy
2015-11-22 23:40:03	inddwtsn	because my way of learning is that i see something cool and i want it and i try to do it
2015-11-22 23:40:19	inddwtsn	i'd rather try to make a game for that
2015-11-22 23:40:24	inddwtsn	for that feel i mean
2015-11-22 23:40:39	sankakuStdDev	idk how you would transition or learn that stuff either because i'm not that familiar with your skillset tbh
2015-11-22 23:40:49	sankakuStdDev	but i'm sure there are people that could guide you
2015-11-22 23:41:03	sankakuStdDev	i've had a programming mentor before and it was super worth while
2015-11-22 23:41:14	sankakuStdDev	maybe you could do the same even if it's an online mentor
2015-11-22 23:41:53	inddwtsn	i never had an anything mentor
2015-11-22 23:42:21	sankakuStdDev	carpe diem bitch
2015-11-22 23:42:52	sankakuStdDev	In argentina do they have the same saying that "God helps those, who help themselves"?
2015-11-22 23:43:33	inddwtsn	im not sure, it's not often that i hear god mentioned
2015-11-22 23:43:53	sankakuStdDev	it's one of the best sayings i've ever heard from the church
2015-11-22 23:44:27	inddwtsn	does your sister say it a lot
2015-11-22 23:44:40	sankakuStdDev	my sister is super religious and she believes that god will reveal the answer to her, and that god will put things in front of her at the appropriate time
2015-11-22 23:44:56	sankakuStdDev	but she can't fuck with me when i tell her that god helps those who help themselves
2015-11-22 23:45:10	sankakuStdDev	if you do nothing, you can't expect god to miraculously make you a milionare
2015-11-22 23:45:32	sankakuStdDev	you have to go out and make opportunities and then god will put the right thing in front of you
2015-11-22 23:45:36	sankakuStdDev	:D
2015-11-22 23:45:43	sankakuStdDev	basically hard work pays off
2015-11-22 23:45:53	sankakuStdDev	the time is moving regardless of if you work hard or not
2015-11-22 23:46:22	sankakuStdDev	two years are going to elapse and maybe you've put the work in and can do your straddle planche after those two years
2015-11-22 23:46:26	sankakuStdDev	or not
2015-11-22 23:46:34	*	sankakuStdDev ends rant
2015-11-22 23:46:46	sankakuStdDev	i just feel for you because you're a smart dude
2015-11-22 23:46:52	sankakuStdDev	and i eFeel for you
2015-11-22 23:48:43	inddwtsn	i am eTouched
2015-11-22 23:48:54	inddwtsn	i can be smart in some things but really dumb in others
2015-11-22 23:49:10	inddwtsn	ie socially and in anything related to money and carreers
2015-11-22 23:50:23	sankakuStdDev	yep, we all have our strengths and weaknesses
2015-11-22 23:50:32	sankakuStdDev	it's cool
2015-11-22 23:50:38	sankakuStdDev	i stare at a computer all day
2015-11-22 23:50:43	sankakuStdDev	no social skills needed
2015-11-22 23:51:06	inddwtsn	ye, you need to get the job
2015-11-22 23:51:09	inddwtsn	and go to interviews
2015-11-22 23:52:02	sankakuStdDev	right, but brogramming jobs are different
2015-11-22 23:52:12	sankakuStdDev	because some poor asshole is stuck in a room with me
2015-11-22 23:52:21	sankakuStdDev	and he's my captive
2015-11-22 23:52:32	sankakuStdDev	i get to talk about programming with him for an entire hour
2015-11-22 23:52:36	sankakuStdDev	and he won't be bored
2015-11-22 23:52:40	sankakuStdDev	or not understand
2015-11-22 23:53:14	sankakuStdDev	and he'll see that i'm super knowledgeable, want to learn more, and that i genuinely enjoy brogramming
2015-11-22 23:53:50	sankakuStdDev	and i'm sure if you were in the same spot where it was a "guy who knows the basics of vim and fucking with linux" job you'd be just as set and worry free
2015-11-22 23:54:50	inddwtsn	i doubt that job exists
2015-11-22 23:54:57	inddwtsn	but i get what you say
2015-11-22 23:55:05	inddwtsn	i just need like a plan
2015-11-22 23:55:13	inddwtsn	which i suck at doing and following 
2015-11-22 23:55:37	sankakuStdDev	yep
2015-11-22 23:56:03	sankakuStdDev	i'm going to finish this stats class i'm taking this month and then buy the data science guy at work lunch and pick his brain to see what's next
2015-11-22 23:57:59	inddwtsn	see i never bought someone lunch 
2015-11-23 00:00:29	sankakuStdDev	lol why not
2015-11-23 00:00:31	sankakuStdDev	it's nice
2015-11-23 00:00:51	sankakuStdDev	even if you don't need to, sometimes it's nice
2015-11-23 00:01:02	inddwtsn	cause i don't know enough people to have that situation arise
2015-11-23 00:01:11	sankakuStdDev	then you have a reason to have lunch again next month so they can buy you lunch
2015-11-23 00:01:17	sankakuStdDev	if it's not a mentor situation
2015-11-23 00:01:30	sankakuStdDev	though my mentor has bought me the majority of the lunches
2015-11-23 00:01:34	inddwtsn	i probably haven't had lunch out more than 5 times in the last 10 years
2015-11-23 00:01:41	sankakuStdDev	but he also makes probalby a quarter of a million a year
2015-11-23 00:01:45	inddwtsn	damn
2015-11-23 00:06:49	sankakuStdDev	i've heard that in some places outside of the US that you don't really go out to eat
2015-11-23 00:06:56	sankakuStdDev	unless it's like a special occasion
2015-11-23 00:07:01	sankakuStdDev	is that how it is in .ar
2015-11-23 00:07:05	sankakuStdDev	or is money just that tight
2015-11-23 00:09:55	inddwtsn	there's really nice places to eat
2015-11-23 00:10:01	inddwtsn	and of course mcdonalds and that shit
2015-11-23 00:10:06	inddwtsn	but i just don't have the habit
2015-11-23 00:10:14	sankakuStdDev	that's good
2015-11-23 00:10:17	inddwtsn	same with ordering
2015-11-23 00:13:02	sankakuStdDev	eating out is something i've gotten way to lax with
2015-11-23 00:13:37	sankakuStdDev	i poorly justify it as paying to save time
2015-11-23 00:13:43	sankakuStdDev	but i just need to be more efficient
2015-11-23 01:15:28	sankakuStdDev	yay or nay https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apdKqXfcAxI
2015-11-23 01:15:29		[ http://is.gd/UPEm6v ]
2015-11-23 01:16:38	inddwtsn	watching movie, i'll listen tomorrow
2015-11-23 01:20:39	sankakuStdDev	cool, it's very experimental bass music
2015-11-23 01:21:14	sankakuStdDev	but in a kind of cliche experimental style with spaceship sounds
2015-11-23 01:22:25	sankakuStdDev	what movie
2015-11-23 01:23:21	inddwtsn	THX 1138
2015-11-23 01:23:27	inddwtsn	george lucas before star wars
2015-11-23 01:24:18	sankakuStdDev	wow cool
2015-11-23 01:24:22	sankakuStdDev	ever even heard of it
2015-11-23 01:26:54	inddwtsn	it's pretty weird
2015-11-23 01:28:14	sankakuStdDev	tbf i've never watched any of the starwars movies from beginning to end
2015-11-23 01:28:23	sankakuStdDev	always wound up giving up
2015-11-23 01:29:02	sankakuStdDev	though i did fool around with a girl with the second old one on once
2015-11-23 01:29:10	sankakuStdDev	that's probably farthest i've gotten
2015-11-23 01:29:12	inddwtsn	lol
2015-11-23 01:38:45	inddwtsn	do you see yourself getting married
2015-11-23 01:39:29	sankakuStdDev	oof
2015-11-23 01:39:36	sankakuStdDev	i havent thought that far ahead
2015-11-23 01:39:38	sankakuStdDev	idk
2015-11-23 01:39:51	sankakuStdDev	i just want to find someone that seems to make me happy for a while
2015-11-23 01:39:57	sankakuStdDev	and then i'll take it from there
2015-11-23 01:40:38	sankakuStdDev	esp since i don't really believe that monogomy is a sensible thing
2015-11-23 01:40:41	sankakuStdDev	what about you
2015-11-23 01:43:05	inddwtsn	you'd be in an open relationship?
2015-11-23 01:43:11	inddwtsn	i don't see myself married
2015-11-23 01:43:37	inddwtsn	i'd like to have a gf for a long time but i dont have any interest in starting a family
2015-11-23 01:43:56	sankakuStdDev	yeah, as much as i'm a boring, traditional guy i think things would have to be open. it's the only thing that's logical in my mind
2015-11-23 01:44:18	sankakuStdDev	you don't want little watsons that look like you and your gf/wife
2015-11-23 01:45:12	inddwtsn	well logical and emotional don't go together well sometimes
2015-11-23 01:45:29	inddwtsn	i think logically there's no reason why i shouldn't be in an open relationship
2015-11-23 01:45:33	inddwtsn	but i can get jealous
2015-11-23 01:46:04	sankakuStdDev	agreed, so can i
2015-11-23 01:46:10	sankakuStdDev	but the more i think about it
2015-11-23 01:46:36	sankakuStdDev	that jealousy is born out of being worried that your partner is going to find someone they like better
2015-11-23 01:47:02	sankakuStdDev	if you were actually happy with the other person and them with you you'd have nothing to worry about
2015-11-23 01:47:12	inddwtsn	i think i'd still feel it
2015-11-23 01:47:35	sankakuStdDev	i've had sex where i just got off and then left, i was so not interested in them  as anything more than a mastubatory aid
2015-11-23 01:47:52	sankakuStdDev	plus i think men and women both feel the biological need to rub genitals with other people
2015-11-23 01:48:03	sankakuStdDev	why not let them scratch that itch and you do the same
2015-11-23 01:48:24	sankakuStdDev	this artificial lock down of the person that they are yours is counter intuitive
2015-11-23 01:48:31	inddwtsn	cause i've felt like shit due to jealousy in the past
2015-11-23 01:48:44	sankakuStdDev	it's looking at things from an approach of scarcity instead of pleanty
2015-11-23 01:48:51	sankakuStdDev	i have too
2015-11-23 01:49:10	inddwtsn	plus i think i know who'd be getting all the sex lol
2015-11-23 01:49:11	sankakuStdDev	everyone has
2015-11-23 01:49:30	sankakuStdDev	there's a healthy level for jealousy to be at i think
2015-11-23 01:49:44	sankakuStdDev	lmao well then even more so why it should be open
2015-11-23 01:49:58	sankakuStdDev	thing are better when each partner knows the other is still viable and wanted
2015-11-23 01:50:18	sankakuStdDev	how many people have you seen start dating and then turn into fat blobs of unmotivated shit
2015-11-23 01:50:31	sankakuStdDev	and then they break up and the guy starts going to the gym again
2015-11-23 01:50:33	sankakuStdDev	fuck that
2015-11-23 01:50:59	sankakuStdDev	i want my girl to be on top of her game, and i want her to know that i'm still on top of my game
2015-11-23 01:51:02	sankakuStdDev	or something like that
2015-11-23 01:51:18	sankakuStdDev	i don't want anyone to be stuck with me
2015-11-23 01:51:35	sankakuStdDev	if you love someone else go be with someone elese #yolo be happy girl
2015-11-23 02:07:50	inddwtsn	hang on finishing movie
2015-11-23 02:08:28	sankakuStdDev	nigga i'm on amphetamines
2015-11-23 02:08:30	sankakuStdDev	i've got all night
2015-11-23 02:08:33	sankakuStdDev	take your time
2015-11-23 02:08:36	sankakuStdDev	finish your popcorn
2015-11-23 02:15:05	inddwtsn	fuck im so sleepy
2015-11-23 02:16:31	sankakuStdDev	sleep is for the weak
2015-11-23 02:16:34	sankakuStdDev	stats all night
2015-11-23 02:16:41	sankakuStdDev	i took this pill 12 hrs ago
2015-11-23 02:16:50	sankakuStdDev	it should wear off at some point right?
2015-11-23 02:16:52	sankakuStdDev	pls
2015-11-23 02:17:37	inddwtsn	i dunno i think there's value in making the choice to be exclusive too
2015-11-23 02:17:50	sankakuStdDev	what's the value
2015-11-23 02:17:53	sankakuStdDev	pls convince me
2015-11-23 02:18:05	sankakuStdDev	because that's the most standard choice in the world today
2015-11-23 02:18:07	inddwtsn	it's kinda like being a vegetarian, i know it makes sense, it's just not for me
2015-11-23 02:18:44	inddwtsn	that you value your SO's feelings more than part of your desires to sleep with strangers
2015-11-23 02:19:36	sankakuStdDev	but here's the rub
2015-11-23 02:20:00	sankakuStdDev	if you're being super jelly it feels like your girl is hurting or disvaluing you in some way
2015-11-23 02:20:05	sankakuStdDev	but that's not the actual case
2015-11-23 02:20:25	sankakuStdDev	she's using some dude as a really accurate dildo
2015-11-23 02:20:54	inddwtsn	that does not make the feeling go away
2015-11-23 02:20:59	sankakuStdDev	what feeling
2015-11-23 02:21:27	sankakuStdDev	jelly goes away
2015-11-23 02:21:45	sankakuStdDev	have you ever had sex where you didn't care about the other person
2015-11-23 02:22:11	inddwtsn	no
2015-11-23 02:22:19	sankakuStdDev	cg had this super sexy little voice and would tell me that she was about to cum
2015-11-23 02:22:27	inddwtsn	idk how that would help anyway
2015-11-23 02:22:51	sankakuStdDev	and i didn't give even a little bit of a fuck about her
2015-11-23 02:23:06	inddwtsn	i gotta go sleep but you can keep talking on fb and i'll read it tomorrow
2015-11-23 02:23:16	sankakuStdDev	maybe it's one of those things you need to experience to understand
2015-11-23 02:23:23	sankakuStdDev	sex is not always the feelsy zone
2015-11-23 02:23:25	sankakuStdDev	that's all
2015-11-23 02:23:27	sankakuStdDev	nn
2015-11-23 02:24:05	inddwtsn	but i don't understand how that would help get rid of the pain of jealousy from someone you do love and care about
