2015-08-14 13:50:10	indeedwatson	i use caps lock
2015-08-14 13:50:23	twitchytoes	Does that disable default caps lock usage?

2015-08-14 13:50:38	twitchytoes	I can't use meta.  It makes my pinky hurt.
2015-08-14 13:50:40	indeedwatson	i guess you can remap capslock function to something else
2015-08-14 13:50:48	logiz	well then you're breaking every single application that uses alt
2015-08-14 13:50:49	indeedwatson	but i never use capslock for its original use
2015-08-14 13:51:02	twitchytoes	I was just wondering if it disabled it and didn't repeatedly toggle caps lock
2015-08-14 13:51:25	indeedwatson	ha, that'd be annoying

2015-08-14 13:56:30	logiz	and if it's easy for you to hold down shift, you're typing wrong
2015-08-14 13:56:31	twitchytoes	done
2015-08-14 13:56:41	indeedwatson	like, alt + capslock
2015-08-14 13:56:49	twitchytoes	I type correctly, but I can hold shift easily because I only use right shift
2015-08-14 13:56:50	indeedwatson	or capslock F2, idk
2015-08-14 13:57:02	logiz	idk I use capslocks quite a few times a day
2015-08-14 13:57:05	logiz	I'd miss it anywhere else
2015-08-14 13:57:19	twitchytoes	Dammit, gtk isn't working.
2015-08-14 13:57:22	logiz	people put ctrl there, that annoys me too, cause ctrl is supposed to be symmetric
2015-08-14 13:57:32	logiz	I can kind of understand escape, I guess
2015-08-14 13:57:34	indeedwatson	i never use my right control
2015-08-14 13:57:36	logiz	but kj is a better escape
2015-08-14 13:57:47	twitchytoes	I don't really use right ctrl either.
2015-08-14 13:57:50	indeedwatson	see, right control would be a good capslock positon
2015-08-14 13:58:27	indeedwatson	btw twitchytoes do you know if you can share a steam library across win and linux?

2015-08-14 13:58:35	twitchytoes	indeedwatson, Share it as in?
2015-08-14 13:58:41	logiz	but right ctrl is used for c-w
2015-08-14 13:58:47	indeedwatson	have it in same location

2015-08-14 15:00:47	indeedwatson	i have a ntfs partition for storage that is 700gb
2015-08-14 15:00:53	indeedwatson	and the fedora partition is like 60gb
2015-08-14 15:01:03	lainlives	twitchytoes: i mapepd my capslock to the 'windows key' and ripped the windows key out of my keyboard
2015-08-14 15:01:22	indeedwatson	lol

2015-08-14 15:01:31	indeedwatson	ty 
2015-08-14 15:01:43	twitchytoes	It's just xmodmap'd then i3 config execs it
2015-08-14 15:01:52	lainlives	did it LOOOOOOOOOONNNNNGGg time ago in my wnidows days, hated how it would minimize a game, and disabling it did nothing as it would randomly renable
2015-08-14 15:02:03	lainlives	i no longer know where the key even is
2015-08-14 15:02:10	indeedwatson	i need to benchmark some games to compare linux and win performance
2015-08-14 15:02:29	lainlives	indeedwatson: only source games will be comparable (sometimes faster)
2015-08-14 15:02:43	lainlives	i wonder how fast the source games would run if the drivers werent shit...
2015-08-14 15:02:51	indeedwatson	luckily the linux games i play are usually indie
2015-08-14 15:02:58	indeedwatson	like dustforce, which is working liek a charm
2015-08-14 15:03:00	twitchytoes	And I have all the windows I open set to automatically head to the right workspaces, though steam causes a minor startup delay or it will start wherever it wants.
2015-08-14 15:03:01	lainlives	but my experience is
2015-08-14 15:03:08	lainlives	every game i ever tried hit the vsync speed
2015-08-14 15:03:12	lainlives	so i have no issues
2015-08-14 15:03:27	indeedwatson	but i want to try vm some games
2015-08-14 15:03:34	lainlives	oh god it works sooo great
2015-08-14 15:03:42	lainlives	assuming your passing through a GPU ofc
2015-08-14 15:03:45	twitchytoes	Unless you plan to vga passthrough a card, it's not gonna do that great.
2015-08-14 15:03:47	lainlives	it has to be a radeon
2015-08-14 15:03:52	indeedwatson	yes, that's what i wanna do
2015-08-14 15:03:58	twitchytoes	And you need more than one gpu to do it
2015-08-14 15:03:58	lainlives	nvidia intentionally breaks passthrough with their drivers
2015-08-14 15:04:03	twitchytoes	That's retarded.
2015-08-14 15:04:03	lainlives	twitchytoes: not really
2015-08-14 15:04:05	indeedwatson	but i don't know how hard it'd be
2015-08-14 15:04:18	lainlives	its jus recommended to have more than one gpu
2015-08-14 15:04:21	twitchytoes	lainlives, I tried to remote into a passthrough from a single gpu system, couldn't do it.
2015-08-14 15:04:24	indeedwatson	twitchytoes: well i have integrated and dedicated, i'd guess that works
2015-08-14 15:04:27	lainlives	nothings stopping you from configuring your machine a headless system
2015-08-14 15:04:27	clammy	oh.. well this is not a big mac I have no idea how I got it in working
2015-08-14 15:04:29	twitchytoes	Ya, that'll work.
2015-08-14 15:04:44	indeedwatson	i need a 2nd monitor, right?
2015-08-14 15:04:50	twitchytoes	Not necessarily.
2015-08-14 15:04:54	lainlives	indeedwatson: no, your monitor needs two inputs :P
2015-08-14 15:04:55	twitchytoes	If your monitor has more than one input, you could just switch inputs.
2015-08-14 15:04:58	clammy	is it chemically caffine though?
2015-08-14 15:04:59	indeedwatson	ah
2015-08-14 15:05:04	lainlives	indeedwatson: whats your dedicated gpu?
2015-08-14 15:05:04	indeedwatson	i want a 2nd monitor anyway
2015-08-14 15:05:16	indeedwatson	R9 270x
2015-08-14 15:05:27	lainlives	cool i tested one of those and it works splendidly
2015-08-14 15:05:41	twitchytoes	I'm using a 750 Ti for native linux gaming.
2015-08-14 15:05:43	indeedwatson	if i wansn't in argentina i'd have waited and got one of the new series
2015-08-14 15:05:59	lainlives	indeedwatson: lol i got one just sitting here taunting me
2015-08-14 15:06:00	indeedwatson	lainlives: do you know any guides or something?
2015-08-14 15:06:02	lainlives	waiting for the new catalyst
2015-08-14 15:06:19	twitchytoes	lainlives, Catalyst is never gonna be good in linux :(
2015-08-14 15:06:24	indeedwatson	they're gonna take ages to get here AND at a decent price
2015-08-14 15:06:35	lainlives	what distro?
2015-08-14 15:06:38	lainlives	twitchytoes: you say that
2015-08-14 15:06:41	indeedwatson	fedora
2015-08-14 15:06:46	lainlives	twitchytoes: but the new catlyst will be USER SPACE only
2015-08-14 15:06:49	lainlives	no kernel driver
2015-08-14 15:06:50	twitchytoes	My r9 290 did worse than my 750 ti does..
2015-08-14 15:06:52	lainlives	that alone is gonna be sexy
2015-08-14 15:07:01	twitchytoes	With catalyst 15.7 and with open source.
2015-08-14 15:07:02	lainlives	twitchytoes: but i use amd out of ehtical reasons
2015-08-14 15:07:10	lainlives	they actually hire OSS devs
2015-08-14 15:07:17	lainlives	nvidia actively works against OSS
2015-08-14 15:07:18	indeedwatson	i use amd out of price reasons lol
2015-08-14 15:07:24	logiz	lainlives: I can't make i3 have vim bindings because it will conflict
2015-08-14 15:07:24	lainlives	why support that bullshit
2015-08-14 15:07:34	logiz	the best thing I can do is choose which gets which
2015-08-14 15:07:40	twitchytoes	I care more about having 60 fps in dota than that.
2015-08-14 15:07:44	logiz	i3 gets meta so I can make vim get c
2015-08-14 15:07:44	twitchytoes	r9 290 with non-steady 60 fps in dota
2015-08-14 15:07:51	twitchytoes	750 ti with more than 60 fps steady.
2015-08-14 15:07:55	twitchytoes	That's sad.
2015-08-14 15:08:00	lainlives	twitchytoes: and thats why the driver situation on linux will never change :3

2015-08-14 15:08:05	indeedwatson	really?
2015-08-14 15:08:06	clammy	Title: Chapter 13. PCI passthrough (at docs.fedoraproject.org)
2015-08-14 15:08:12	lainlives	indeedwatson: this assumes you have some knowlage of virtualization tech though
2015-08-14 15:08:18	twitchytoes	AMD's drivers are just so bad in linux.
2015-08-14 15:08:25	twitchytoes	Otherwise I would get an APU when Zen comes out
2015-08-14 15:08:28	twitchytoes	And ditch my gpu altogether.
2015-08-14 15:08:31	lainlives	twitchytoes: i disagree, i find radeon > nouveau
2015-08-14 15:08:36	indeedwatson	lainlives: uh i dont, but ill look into it slowly, im still setting up fedora and i3
2015-08-14 15:08:40	lainlives	idgaf about closed driver performance
2015-08-14 15:08:46	twitchytoes	Nouveau is reverse engineered, ofc radeon will be better.
2015-08-14 15:08:49	lainlives	ill use it until radeon catches up though
2015-08-14 15:09:00	twitchytoes	But when a r9 290 does worse than a 750 ti regardless of driver, there is a major problem.
2015-08-14 15:09:03	lainlives	and in the last two years radeon is now competitive with catalyst!
2015-08-14 15:09:20	indeedwatson	if the passthrough works with dark souls and metal gear well enough and i can ditch windows, id be so happy
2015-08-14 15:09:46	twitchytoes	If done correctly, it should be near native performance.  Your main issue will be how many cpu cores and ram you can pass through.
2015-08-14 15:09:53	lainlives	indeedwatson: it will
2015-08-14 15:10:01	lainlives	~95% native speed or so
2015-08-14 15:10:23	lainlives	indeedwatson: the fedora handbook has alot of info on virtualisation in fedora
2015-08-14 15:10:27	lainlives	and its written very well too
2015-08-14 15:10:30	twitchytoes	If I didn't have a p67 board, I could play with passthrough.  Also if I had VT-d <.<
2015-08-14 15:10:36	lainlives	so id keep an eye on that
2015-08-14 15:10:42	indeedwatson	the only downside is that ill have to reformat everything cause the fedora partition is too small
2015-08-14 15:10:49	indeedwatson	i should get a 2nd disk
2015-08-14 15:10:50	lainlives	indeedwatson: so?
2015-08-14 15:10:52	lainlives	yea
2015-08-14 15:10:58	lainlives	or use a different partition altogether
2015-08-14 15:11:03	twitchytoes	I only use my second drive to manage backups
2015-08-14 15:11:07	lainlives	xD iirc you can even map a physical HDD to the vm
2015-08-14 15:11:14	twitchytoes	It's risky
2015-08-14 15:11:17	twitchytoes	But you can
2015-08-14 15:11:25	lainlives	its only risky if you dont know what your doing
2015-08-14 15:11:26	twitchytoes	I've booted into the os I was using at the time from a physical hdd in a vm..
2015-08-14 15:11:29	lainlives	im sure indeedwatson is capable of reading
2015-08-14 15:11:30	twitchytoes	It didn't end well.
2015-08-14 15:11:32	indeedwatson	i have too many partitions already, 1 for windows, 1 for storage, fedora, and one with the windows10 iso
2015-08-14 15:11:42	twitchytoes	It was ubuntu-ception
2015-08-14 15:11:55	lainlives	indeedwatson: you can fit that VM onto the storage partition...
2015-08-14 15:11:56	indeedwatson	lainlives: i both read and not know what im doing at the same time
2015-08-14 15:12:09	logiz	man
2015-08-14 15:12:12	lainlives	indeedwatson: hold on, theres a good guie somewhere im trying to find it xD
2015-08-14 15:12:13	indeedwatson	lainlives: but in ntfs? does it not make a difference?
2015-08-14 15:12:15	logiz	folding code is awesome
2015-08-14 15:12:15	twitchytoes	If your windows partition does not use the same bootloader as the linux one, you could virtualize that partition.
2015-08-14 15:12:22	logiz	much easier to navigate this shit now
2015-08-14 15:12:28	logiz	also I should probably put a license on thise

2015-08-14 15:13:29	twitchytoes	I know when I had grub dealing with windows and ubuntu partitions, I booted into ubuntu on accident from the VM while I was using ubuntu..
2015-08-14 15:13:31	twitchytoes	So..
2015-08-14 15:13:33	twitchytoes	That was fun
2015-08-14 15:13:58	indeedwatson	AppAraat: yes, but i already installed catalyst
2015-08-14 15:14:00	logiz	nah Idk what to license it as, there is code, I was gonna use gpl3, but it seems too non-permissive, Idgaf really, just do things legit, thinking about CC
2015-08-14 15:14:08	lainlives	ive never had issues virtualizing a HDD, it was last of my bootlist and shared nothing with the 1st bootlist

2015-08-14 15:15:37	lainlives	but at least its easier to install the drivers than it was to get the ones from RPMfusion to work

2015-08-14 15:15:57	logiz	I'm going to fix that
2015-08-14 15:16:11	indeedwatson	i have a question now actually, should I install TF2 on the ext4 partition to see if it has better performance than from ntfs?
2015-08-14 15:16:22	lainlives	indeedwatson: it will
2015-08-14 15:16:29	lainlives	it will load signifigantly faster

2015-08-14 15:17:22	AppAraat	E = 2edgy.
2015-08-14 15:17:24	indeedwatson	can windows read ext4 at all?

2015-08-14 15:18:52	indeedwatson	i could ask a friend 
2015-08-14 15:19:13	lainlives	indeedwatson: but i recommend setting up libvirt, getting familiar with it, then once you got windows running in libvirt then try to do the gpu passthrough using the fedora handbook
2015-08-14 15:19:14	adsmz	make a second partition big enough to hold the important stuff
2015-08-14 15:19:15	lainlives	thats how i did it

2015-08-14 16:36:54	icarusdekoe	let the community bugfix it :P
2015-08-14 16:36:56	lainlives	its cloning more than john deere though, it also clones a few other companies
2015-08-14 16:37:07	icarusdekoe	thats not called cloning...
2015-08-14 16:37:12	icarusdekoe	thats called being inspired

2015-08-14 16:39:25	icarusdekoe	"clone" is basically the same as reimplimenting an interface...
2015-08-14 16:39:35	icarusdekoe	like google did with android

2015-08-14 16:40:39	lainlives	icarusdekoe: GPS is airforce and russian gov
2015-08-14 16:40:42	lainlives	public gps anyway
2015-08-14 16:40:50	logiz	icarusdekoe: yeah but it's funny watching all these liberal college kids  write on facebook that we're spending too much on military stuff
2015-08-14 16:40:54	lainlives	but theres plethora MORE gps sats than those
2015-08-14 16:40:58	logiz	when nearly everything they're doing was military research
2015-08-14 16:41:00	icarusdekoe	lainlives: i knew it was military, and "weaker" versions were civilian
2015-08-14 16:41:19	lainlives	we hav a subscription to about 40(minium) sats that arent public use

2015-08-14 16:41:45	logiz	heh
2015-08-14 16:41:47	icarusdekoe	logiz: well, we for sure are. most of that money goes to defence contractors for shit we dont need. only a small bit goes toward awesome research
2015-08-14 16:41:50	lainlives	without the ground posts
2015-08-14 16:42:07	lainlives	ground post gps though can get accuracy within a fraction of a CM
2015-08-14 16:42:21	logiz	eh, when it comes to things like the internet, I don't care how much wasteful money is thrown to make something so important to humanity
2015-08-14 16:42:33	logiz	that 1% more than makes up for it

2015-08-14 16:42:56	icarusdekoe	logiz: thats called the NASA project :P

2015-08-14 16:44:29	logiz	pretty sure they get money from military for working on projects
2015-08-14 16:44:30	lainlives	icarusdekoe: its actually both
2015-08-14 16:44:32	logiz	I don't know their entire funding
2015-08-14 16:44:39	logiz	but if they weren't a military project they'd have failed years ago
2015-08-14 16:44:42	icarusdekoe	lainlives: probably depends on the project
2015-08-14 16:44:44	lainlives	they do get alot of military money
2015-08-14 16:44:56	*	icarusdekoe should ask his friend who works at nasa
2015-08-14 16:44:56	lainlives	icarusdekoe: yes, but they are typically ALWAYS researching something for the US gov

2015-08-14 16:45:25	lainlives	becauase its well known that they do
2015-08-14 16:45:28	logiz	probably enough to work on their other projects
2015-08-14 16:45:38	lainlives	no, iirc they wouldnt be allowed to
2015-08-14 16:45:44	lainlives	military money has to goto military spending
2015-08-14 16:45:52	logiz	and if nasa is considered a military project
2015-08-14 16:45:53	icarusdekoe	lainlives: i would bet it depends on the project. like jets/terestrial rockets would probably be more military focused than space exploration
2015-08-14 16:45:55	logiz	then
2015-08-14 16:46:03	lainlives	logiz: as icarusdekoe said, it depends ont he project
2015-08-14 16:46:04	logiz	"hey yeah we're working on these things so we need these new machines that happen to help us with this other thing"
2015-08-14 16:46:12	logiz	that's how EVERY financial grant goes
2015-08-14 16:46:15	icarusdekoe	but NASA gets boned on a lot of projects...
2015-08-14 16:46:15	lainlives	IE no military spending on a project hte military dont want
2015-08-14 16:46:31	logiz	but it's probably a use it or lose it
2015-08-14 16:46:35	lainlives	icarusdekoe: i think its bullshit that we, the united states, amonsgt the richest nations in teh world, ahve to use fucking russian and private rockets to get to space
2015-08-14 16:46:42	icarusdekoe	like "do this, but you have to use all the equipment we bought for this old project, and have way too little money"
2015-08-14 16:46:50	logiz	fund something that has multiple purposes with your surplus
2015-08-14 16:46:58	logiz	that's essentially how computers came into existence
2015-08-14 16:47:04	icarusdekoe	lainlives: in many cases its cheaper/more efficient...
2015-08-14 16:47:05	lainlives	hah theres no such thing as surplus money
2015-08-14 16:47:11	icarusdekoe	because of the way government grants work
2015-08-14 16:47:12	logiz	lainlives: of course not :P
2015-08-14 16:47:15	lainlives	icarusdekoe: yea, it really is, the shuttel project was bullshit
2015-08-14 16:47:28	lainlives	icarusdekoe: shuttels only had the design they had because the airforce wouldnt give money otherwise
2015-08-14 16:47:36	icarusdekoe	they might get 100mil, but that project only gets X of it. and they get no say in that dispersement
2015-08-14 16:47:38	logiz	but there is a legitimate use for bullshit spending in the military
2015-08-14 16:47:46	logiz	cause if they lose that money and they happen to need it next year, they won't get it
2015-08-14 16:47:59	logiz	also it puts out other companies that make stuff
2015-08-14 16:48:04	logiz	aren't we just making tanks for fun now?
2015-08-14 16:48:06	lainlives	OH WOW autosteer lagoon boats

2015-08-14 16:48:18	logiz	lainlives: boat technology is fucking awesome
2015-08-14 16:48:21	lainlives	can be programemd to loop, or detect thick manure and follow the thick manure!
2015-08-14 16:48:27	icarusdekoe	because rockets are sooooo much more efficient..
2015-08-14 16:48:30	logiz	have you seen those super fast racing ones that are like 50 feet in the air?
2015-08-14 16:48:36	lainlives	icarusdekoe: rockets are superior
2015-08-14 16:48:40	logiz	only like a food of it touches the water
2015-08-14 16:48:46	lainlives	icarusdekoe: yea, shuttle design all comes bac to the airforce
2015-08-14 16:48:52	lainlives	icarusdekoe: im sure your freind will have an earfull about that
2015-08-14 16:48:58	lainlives	as ill bet it angers him
2015-08-14 16:49:10	icarusdekoe	lainlives: ive had several conversations with him about these things.
2015-08-14 16:49:12	logiz	lol
2015-08-14 16:49:25	logiz	lainlives: or the fact that you almost have to be in the air force to be an astronaut
2015-08-14 16:49:31	logiz	that's not something they tell kindergarteners
2015-08-14 16:49:39	lainlives	logiz: to be fair though
2015-08-14 16:49:49	icarusdekoe	basically lots of cases of projects that are given completley arbitrary restrictions, that make the technical details way more difficult than they need to be
2015-08-14 16:49:49	lainlives	that is the most likely place to get people who can withstand sustained high G loads
2015-08-14 16:49:56	logiz	well yeah
2015-08-14 16:50:02	logiz	but it's actually kind of neat
2015-08-14 16:50:07	logiz	we think of high education as the ivy league schools

2015-08-14 18:21:15	lainlives	i dont like normal twizzlers
2015-08-14 18:21:18	lainlives	just the pull n peel
2015-08-14 18:21:19	logiz	one bag of m&ms a day for a month
2015-08-14 18:21:21	lainlives	they taste different
2015-08-14 18:21:23	logiz	is 13 pounds
2015-08-14 18:21:33	logiz	month = 30 days
2015-08-14 18:21:46	logiz	figuring a bag of m&ms is 7oz
2015-08-14 18:21:48	lainlives	logiz: once i went to pick up my kid sister at school, and i was sitting there holding a bag and m&ms, i didnt realize how bad i looked until afterwards
2015-08-14 18:21:57	lainlives	the 48oz bag
2015-08-14 18:21:58	lainlives	xD
2015-08-14 18:22:01	logiz	lol
2015-08-14 18:22:06	logiz	yeah I could seriously go to town on them
2015-08-14 18:22:09	logiz	I usually do once a year
2015-08-14 18:22:14	logiz	holidays I'll get a big bag
2015-08-14 18:22:18	logiz	be like "oh I'll save it"

2015-08-14 18:22:33	lainlives	my dad does it alot too, i have to ban him from buyin candy or he will kill himself with his diabetic body
2015-08-14 18:22:38	logiz	it sounds bad, but here's the thing people don't get
2015-08-14 18:22:48	logiz	doing a crazy thing once in a while is not the same thing as doing many stupid things all the time
2015-08-14 18:23:10	logiz	you're not gonna get fat from too many m&ms once in a while, you're gonna get fat from eating too many m&ms every fucking day
2015-08-14 18:23:17	lainlives	yea
2015-08-14 18:23:23	lainlives	its basic science
2015-08-14 18:23:29	logiz	yeah but people go nuts
2015-08-14 18:23:32	logiz	like
2015-08-14 18:23:35	lainlives	even nutritionists say your allowed to indulge occasionally
2015-08-14 18:23:36	logiz	"oh I'm on a diet I can't eat this or that"
2015-08-14 18:23:43	logiz	yes you fucking can, just eat less of it and skip a meal or something
2015-08-14 18:23:48	logiz	or better yet, stay an extra half hour at the gym
2015-08-14 18:23:54	logiz	oh you don't go to the gym, your diet isnt' every serious
2015-08-14 18:23:55	lainlives	or, just do it once and not again for a long time
2015-08-14 18:24:00	logiz	oh look you have a cheat day every 3 days
2015-08-14 18:24:03	logiz	good fucking job
2015-08-14 18:24:06	lainlives	i started getting in better shape just eating candy every other week
2015-08-14 18:24:16	lainlives	its nuts how much eating candy can prohibit muscle growth
2015-08-14 18:24:23	logiz	I started getting in better shape and eating candy every day
2015-08-14 18:24:28	logiz	but when you're exercising for 5 hours
2015-08-14 18:24:33	logiz	I mean, a bag of candy wasn't doing shit
2015-08-14 18:24:46	lainlives	sometimes at work i excersize for 16hours straight
2015-08-14 18:24:51	logiz	yeah
2015-08-14 18:24:57	logiz	that's the one thing about labor that's awesome
2015-08-14 18:25:10	lainlives	yea since i started doing this job i feel better most the time
2015-08-14 18:25:12	lainlives	when im not sore
2015-08-14 18:25:25	logiz	but if you want to create muscle growth, like in a real way
2015-08-14 18:25:28	logiz	you gotta eat like a fatty
2015-08-14 18:25:33	logiz	then you just cut it for a couple of months
2015-08-14 18:25:33	lainlives	i do, just not candy
2015-08-14 18:25:38	lainlives	but you know my diet :3
2015-08-14 18:25:39	logiz	and you stop looking like a bloated fools
2015-08-14 18:25:57	logiz	if you look at body builders eating, it's fucking nuts
2015-08-14 18:26:00	logiz	I can't afford to do it
2015-08-14 18:26:02	logiz	too much food
2015-08-14 18:26:04	lainlives	i easly eat 3-5lbs of meats every day
2015-08-14 18:26:09	logiz	yeah
2015-08-14 18:26:15	logiz	body builders do that for every meal lol
2015-08-14 18:26:18	lainlives	yea
2015-08-14 18:26:22	lainlives	i read about one
2015-08-14 18:26:28	lainlives	hed eat 26 snickers at 1am
2015-08-14 18:26:30	lainlives	then go back to sleep
2015-08-14 18:26:32	logiz	lol
2015-08-14 18:26:33	lainlives	wake up and work it off
2015-08-14 18:26:44	lainlives	he ate close to 20lbs of food daily
2015-08-14 18:26:46	logiz	it's not even working it off at the point,it's more of just making it into something else
2015-08-14 18:26:57	logiz	skinny kids know that feel
2015-08-14 18:27:01	lainlives	yea by working it off i mean generally converting it to energy, or muscle
2015-08-14 18:27:03	logiz	they can't put on muscle or weight cause they don't eat enough
2015-08-14 18:27:11	lainlives	not always, im scrawny as fuck
2015-08-14 18:27:17	lainlives	most my body weight comes from muscle
2015-08-14 18:27:27	logiz	a lot of mine does too
2015-08-14 18:27:30	lainlives	iirc my BMI was insane and impressed my doctor, fat just 'passes through'
2015-08-14 18:27:37	lainlives	i get fat filled shits sometimes and they smell awefull
2015-08-14 18:27:38	logiz	lol
2015-08-14 18:27:45	logiz	my bmi is a bit out of whack, it's a stupid scale
2015-08-14 18:27:49	lainlives	it is
2015-08-14 18:27:50	logiz	cause of my body type
2015-08-14 18:27:57	lainlives	but it is a decent indication if nothing else
2015-08-14 18:28:03	logiz	in the best shape of my life, I could never drop under 11%
2015-08-14 18:28:11	logiz	and I think if I got to 8% it was a "health risk" and I had to stop sports
2015-08-14 18:28:18	logiz	and I always cut down to the health risk
2015-08-14 18:28:23	lainlives	i remember my body fat index was below 5% or some shit like that, something almost inhumanly low
2015-08-14 18:28:31	logiz	yeah that's pretty ridic
2015-08-14 18:28:40	logiz	the only people I knew that low were 110 pounds in senior year of high school
2015-08-14 18:28:43	logiz	and they looks like aliens
2015-08-14 18:28:45	lainlives	but i gained weight since the job, its mostly muscle weight though
2015-08-14 18:28:56	lainlives	logiz: before i started this job i was less than 120
2015-08-14 18:29:00	logiz	jesus christ
2015-08-14 18:29:06	logiz	I hope you're not 6 feet tall
2015-08-14 18:29:07	lainlives	now im upwards of 175 last i checked
2015-08-14 18:29:27	lainlives	and my muscles are no longer squishy
2015-08-14 18:29:36	lainlives	they are small but dense as fuck
2015-08-14 18:29:54	logiz	I"m pretty well proportioned, just slightly under average height, I'm told to become a body builder all thet time cause my muscles get big
2015-08-14 18:29:57	logiz	all swole and shit
2015-08-14 18:31:28	lainlives	i hear id be good at squatting
2015-08-14 18:31:30	lainlives	whatever that is
2015-08-14 18:31:46	lainlives	oen body builder mentioned how jealous he was of my leg structure some time ago
2015-08-14 18:32:01	lainlives	just stopped me at a walmart an was like 'DUDE DO YOU WORK OUT!?'
2015-08-14 18:32:20	lainlives	'nope just walk alot and do a shit job'
2015-08-14 18:32:27	*	lainlives likes making shitty job puns and jokes
2015-08-14 18:32:43	lainlives	not many jobs as /shitty/ as mine :D
2015-08-14 18:33:19	lainlives	logiz: i hope you get employed somewhere decent soon, so you can start investing
2015-08-14 18:33:35	lainlives	has to suck being in NY with shit for cash
2015-08-14 18:33:48	logiz	yuuuuuuuuup
2015-08-14 18:33:59	logiz	I don't really consider myself stuck, just unwilling to be other places
2015-08-14 18:34:11	logiz	like I'm not saying I can easily get a job elsewhere, but I don't really try to get jobs in other places nearly as much
2015-08-14 18:34:19	logiz	sometimes I'll apply to another city
2015-08-14 18:34:23	lainlives	yea i have that problem too, im looking for something to do during summer/winter but im quite picky (ironically)
2015-08-14 18:34:26	logiz	but I don't really apply to small cities with small tech
2015-08-14 18:34:46	logiz	I have before, in bum fuck conneticut
2015-08-14 18:34:51	logiz	which isn't super far, but the lifestyle would just suck
2015-08-14 18:34:55	lainlives	i understand xD you want a job you will like and has room for growth
2015-08-14 18:35:02	lainlives	those two things are hard to find together
2015-08-14 18:35:05	logiz	I figure it this way, I want a few good years before I settle down
2015-08-14 18:35:16	logiz	I honestly don't care about room for growth
2015-08-14 18:35:19	lainlives	logiz: i do recommend moving out of NY though :\ ny has to be shitty
2015-08-14 18:35:28	logiz	I care about room for career highs, but at different companies
2015-08-14 18:35:34	*	lainlives is tired of seeing shit made in C
2015-08-14 18:35:35	logiz	I'm not looking to retire at the same company
2015-08-14 18:35:44	logiz	I plan on switching jobs every year or two
2015-08-14 18:35:48	logiz	pay ceiling is a big problem in tech
2015-08-14 18:35:55	lainlives	just /looking/ at C makes me feel its ancient logical programming
2015-08-14 18:35:58	lainlives	its ugly
2015-08-14 18:36:03	logiz	I know a kid that juts left his job after 6 months to get a 10k raise elsewhere
2015-08-14 18:36:08	lainlives	i so dont wanna learn C D:
2015-08-14 18:36:14	lainlives	logiz: oh definitly
2015-08-14 18:36:34	logiz	C isn't terrible it just has stuff you don't want to think about
2015-08-14 18:36:36	lainlives	if some company tried to snatch me from my primary gig right now though, i dont think id go even for higher pay
2015-08-14 18:36:38	logiz	there are terrible things about it though
2015-08-14 18:36:40	logiz	like bugs with scanf
2015-08-14 18:36:49	logiz	segfaults that have been there for years
2015-08-14 18:36:53	logiz	lots of gotchas
2015-08-14 18:36:58	logiz	but if you know it, you know how to avoid that stuff
2015-08-14 18:37:04	lainlives	something about essentially building a company is rewarding
2015-08-14 18:37:28	lainlives	plus i dont want to see it fall to shit when i leave
2015-08-14 18:37:31	logiz	yeah I mean you seem to make enough to be happy
2015-08-14 18:37:41	logiz	so if its pride for you to work there and make it better
2015-08-14 18:37:43	logiz	then by all means
2015-08-14 18:37:45	dhscholb	speaking of jobs, anyone here want to be a linux admin in sunny florida? :D
2015-08-14 18:37:51	lainlives	hell no

2015-08-14 18:38:09	lainlives	nice place really
2015-08-14 18:38:16	dhscholb	yeah, I like it
2015-08-14 18:38:29	dhscholb	small town, but not too small
2015-08-14 18:38:32	lainlives	yea
2015-08-14 18:38:35	logiz	seems really small
2015-08-14 18:38:40	logiz	rural florida
2015-08-14 18:38:43	lainlives	bigger than my town
2015-08-14 18:38:44	lainlives	xD

2015-08-14 18:47:33	lainlives	indeedwatson: or any game
2015-08-14 18:47:34	indeedwatson	a very hard and good game
2015-08-14 18:47:36	lainlives	with a 60hz monitor
2015-08-14 18:47:41	indeedwatson	lainlives: tf2 matters
2015-08-14 18:47:43	lainlives	no
2015-08-14 18:47:45	indeedwatson	even with 60hz
2015-08-14 18:47:45	indeedwatson	yes
2015-08-14 18:47:50	lainlives	your gpu is making frames that arent even being rendered
2015-08-14 18:47:51	logiz	sounds the problem was with the compositor

2015-08-14 18:48:07	stormysea	hi, I have a quick question about the Intel ME after reading a post on the sub today. I'm trying to find out if their Atom Z3735F chip has it. I looked it up on ARK, but it doesn't say anything about whether the processor has ME or not. does that mean this one doesn't have it?
2015-08-14 18:48:19	lainlives	ME?
2015-08-14 18:48:19	indeedwatson	yes but the feel of the game is smoother near 100fps
2015-08-14 18:48:25	indeedwatson	YES YOU

2015-08-14 18:49:44	lainlives	if so, then its a good bet it does
2015-08-14 18:49:56	indeedwatson	i should set i3 to automatically open games in new workspaces

2015-08-14 18:50:30	lainlives	stormysea: yes, how intel numbers cpus is a good way to find out, as higher number in a series TYPICALLY (not always) is a higher end model
2015-08-14 18:50:53	lainlives	indeedwatson: youd get better performance in xfce if you disable compositing
2015-08-14 18:51:06	lainlives	compositing is the #1 issue for DEs causing bad game performance
2015-08-14 18:51:08	logiz	yeah I forgot that they have compositing in the newer xfce
2015-08-14 18:51:15	logiz	s/newer/fewyearsago/
2015-08-14 18:51:26	lainlives	logiz: well tbh, i LOVE compositing, i dont use it anymore, but the idea really is solid
2015-08-14 18:52:12	lainlives	but my cpu is so blindingly powerfull, it can handle generally anything i throw at it, why offload it into the MORE inefficiant GPU xD
2015-08-14 18:52:47	lainlives	most people who bitch about linux distros killing their laptop battery life are using compositing too
2015-08-14 18:52:55	lainlives	or a gpu without power switching support in the drivers
2015-08-14 18:53:19	lainlives	generally both
2015-08-14 18:53:35	indeedwatson	lainlives: i dont even know what compositing is, but i3 is my main, i just logged into xfce cause i thought doing the catalyst install would be easier there

2015-08-14 20:17:57	lainlives	hes being grilled hard because he tries not to back any side
2015-08-14 20:18:05	lainlives	and appearently that means hes payed by corporations?

2015-08-14 20:32:29	lainlives	hmm firefox seem to have a memory leak
2015-08-14 20:32:32	lainlives	what else is new
2015-08-14 20:33:25	logiz	yeah I've noticed that for a while now
2015-08-14 20:33:38	logiz	but I'm tstarting to think it's specifical flash plugin on some random tab on some random site
2015-08-14 20:36:22	lainlives	not me, as i dont have flash
2015-08-14 20:36:30	lainlives	but i am using aurora
2015-08-14 20:36:42	lainlives	ill leave it open until it starts to slow the system
2015-08-14 20:36:46	lainlives	its only eating 5gb
2015-08-14 20:41:31	indeedwatson	 i havent had a memory leak in a while
2015-08-14 20:45:40	lainlives	indeedwatson: your also probably using firefox stable

2015-08-14 20:53:43	indeedwatson	i dont recall, i think i was using the dev version in windows
2015-08-14 21:00:25	lainlives	indeedwatson: yea thats the version i use (developer preview, internally called aurora)
2015-08-14 21:00:35	lainlives	its nice having an update daily, and yet not be as broken as nightly
2015-08-14 21:01:15	lainlives	ahah i had to kill it
2015-08-14 21:01:33	lainlives	i checked back and it was eating like 9gb, i didnt know a single program was allowed to use so much?
2015-08-14 21:01:46	lainlives	then again i think i removed a few types of memory limits for audio stuffs
2015-08-14 21:03:51	indeedwatson	  oh i thought it was called nightly?
2015-08-14 21:04:00	indeedwatson	and aurora was the one a bit more stable
2015-08-14 21:04:03	indeedwatson	and then beta
2015-08-14 21:04:25	lainlives	yea, stable beta aurora nightly

2015-08-14 21:05:07	lainlives	aurora
2015-08-14 21:05:16	lainlives	if you mean 'developer preview' version
2015-08-14 21:05:30	lainlives	its hte version i use, nice balance of stability and new features
2015-08-14 21:05:54	lainlives	indeedwatson: i also like the upstream binaries, since it autoupdates akin to the windows version
2015-08-14 21:06:39	indeedwatson	 this is weird, whenever i pause mpv, switching desktops in i3 acts weird
2015-08-14 21:06:46	clammy	they look really nothing you care about the ps4 wiki: Departing from the same way you look repulsive unless you're actually using it
2015-08-14 21:06:55	indeedwatson	but if i keep mpv playing in full screen i can switch workspaces no problem
2015-08-14 21:06:59	lainlives	people use mpv?
2015-08-14 21:07:01	lainlives	wow
2015-08-14 21:07:29	indeedwatson	i really really love it
2015-08-14 21:07:43	lainlives	wwell TIL
2015-08-14 21:07:45	indeedwatson	pls tell me you dont use vlc :D
2015-08-14 21:07:50	lainlives	dragon usually
2015-08-14 21:07:54	lainlives	vlc for the videos it hates
2015-08-14 21:08:07	indeedwatson	mpv doesnt hate any videos so far

2015-08-14 21:09:35	indeedwatson	im just joking, to me vlc is like the ubuntu of media players
2015-08-14 21:10:15	indeedwatson	i used to have a very old computer and i tested several players, and mpv was the one that used less resources, so i stuck with it
2015-08-14 21:10:15	lainlives	i like how its more or less self contained

2015-08-14 21:13:15	lainlives	i use vlc for high quality video

2015-08-14 21:16:45	lainlives	VLC is great, it has the features i want
2015-08-14 21:16:53	lainlives	how well does mpv handle multiple audio tracks and multipe sub tracks?
2015-08-14 21:16:58	lainlives	last i checked, not very well
2015-08-14 21:17:09	indeedwatson	you press a key and it switches
2015-08-14 21:17:37	indeedwatson	j cycles between subs
2015-08-14 21:17:48	indeedwatson	not sure for audio since it's been a while since i used dual audio
2015-08-14 21:17:58	lainlives	i got alot of videos with upwards of 5x audio
2015-08-14 21:18:19	lainlives	does it handle alternate angle viewing on dvds?
2015-08-14 21:18:19	indeedwatson	i had a similar problem with other players
2015-08-14 21:18:28	indeedwatson	i think it was smplayer, some videos would play 2x
2015-08-14 21:18:30	lainlives	because last i checked, not many players do
2015-08-14 21:18:33	indeedwatson	but mpv played them fine
2015-08-14 21:18:39	lainlives	alot of concert dvds have them
2015-08-14 21:18:45	lainlives	view the convert from various angles
2015-08-14 21:18:53	indeedwatson	like a full iso dvd?
2015-08-14 21:18:53	lainlives	disney movies use them too
2015-08-14 21:18:58	lainlives	indeedwatson: yea
2015-08-14 21:19:05	lainlives	but with multiple /video/ tracks
2015-08-14 21:19:08	indeedwatson	no clue, i never download iso anymore
2015-08-14 21:19:12	lainlives	disney uses them too
2015-08-14 21:19:26	lainlives	heh i ripped ours, my dad has a 2000x strong colelction
2015-08-14 21:19:26	indeedwatson	i dont watch concerts tbh
2015-08-14 21:19:33	lainlives	disney uses the best use of the dvd angle function ever
2015-08-14 21:19:36	lainlives	if you switch audio language
2015-08-14 21:19:43	lainlives	it uses the angle function to change the text too
2015-08-14 21:19:46	indeedwatson	disney animated movies?
2015-08-14 21:19:55	lainlives	so the text on signs read in that language
2015-08-14 21:19:58	lainlives	i noticed it on snow white
2015-08-14 21:20:07	lainlives	the dwarves names were in spanish on the spanish audio track!
2015-08-14 21:20:10	lainlives	on the beds!
2015-08-14 21:20:21	indeedwatson	i tend to watch things in original language with subs
2015-08-14 21:20:46	lainlives	my sister went throug hthat 'i wanna learn spanish' phase
2015-08-14 21:21:13	indeedwatson	yeah subs are good for that, it's how i learned english
2015-08-14 21:22:02	lainlives	but its neat that no matter what language you select in most disney animated movies, the signs and other text in teh movie reflect your language choice
2015-08-14 21:22:56	indeedwatson	pixar does the same right?
2015-08-14 21:23:47	lainlives	no clue
2015-08-14 21:23:52	lainlives	i just noticed it on snow white and googled it
2015-08-14 21:24:02	lainlives	and at least hte disney movies are like that
2015-08-14 21:25:02	indeedwatson	well pixar is from disney now and I recall a reddit post that in some asian version of Up they changed a food a baby was eating, because the cultural context of the food in the original wasn't the same
2015-08-14 21:25:20	lainlives	oh yea, that movie called inside or something
2015-08-14 21:25:30	lainlives	yea thats not uncommon
2015-08-14 21:25:40	lainlives	lots of cultural relevent stuff gets changed in regional releases
2015-08-14 21:26:20	indeedwatson	oh inside out
2015-08-14 21:27:10	lainlives	yea that
2015-08-14 21:27:19	lainlives	ima have to rent that to watch with my sister sometime

2015-08-14 21:32:15	lainlives	oh yea i was also recommended to donate money this year, what are some charities taht arent complete bullshit
2015-08-14 21:32:44	indeedwatson	me
2015-08-14 21:32:55	lainlives	well thats not tax deductable
2015-08-14 21:33:04	indeedwatson	but indeedwatson a mechanical keyboard foundation
2015-08-14 21:33:08	indeedwatson	buy*
2015-08-14 21:33:26	lainlives	indeedwatson: i have been searching fo the perect mech for almost a year now
2015-08-14 21:33:30	lainlives	i think i setteld on the k70
2015-08-14 21:33:37	lainlives	because it has the best linux support
2015-08-14 21:33:43	lainlives	with cool audio visualisers
2015-08-14 21:34:19	indeedwatson	i own an extremely ancient mechanical keyboard that I can't use because the connector is so weird
2015-08-14 21:34:25	indeedwatson	DIN5, something like that
2015-08-14 21:34:40	indeedwatson	but other than that, I never touched a mech keyboard
2015-08-14 21:34:45	lainlives	ahh yea get a DIN to PS/2 then a PS/2 to USB
2015-08-14 21:34:52	lainlives	so you can use it on modern computers!
2015-08-14 21:35:37	indeedwatson	i asked about that, apparently i need some weird type of switch or board because just a convertor isn't enough to power it, or something
2015-08-14 21:36:00	lainlives	i think thats unlikely
2015-08-14 21:36:10	lainlives	since DIN5 to ps/2 is common
2015-08-14 21:36:14	lainlives	and ps/2 is +5v
2015-08-14 21:36:14	indeedwatson	well i did change the cable for a ps/2 one
2015-08-14 21:36:28	indeedwatson	and the lights went on, but no input at all

2015-08-14 21:40:02	indeedwatson	i guess it could be the old kb, but it's not worth testing further, it doesn't even have a win key!
2015-08-14 21:40:05	lainlives	bah when the lights come on on the KB w/o any other input
2015-08-14 21:40:12	lainlives	it is probably related to miswiring

2015-08-14 21:56:50	lainlives	actually, someone on this channel recommended it after i was bitching about vi
2015-08-14 21:57:05	lainlives	and they said 'it has vaguely UI-esque keybindings that your used to'
2015-08-14 21:57:45	indeedwatson	i admit i barely know the keybindings from nano too
2015-08-14 21:57:59	lainlives	well they are quite close to notepad++s and kate's
2015-08-14 21:58:01	lainlives	so theres that
2015-08-14 21:58:06	lainlives	i know alot of them from that alone xD
2015-08-14 22:00:03	indeedwatson	what do you use to transfer files from android phone to linux desktop without cable?
2015-08-14 22:00:11	lainlives	some ftp app from f-droid
2015-08-14 22:00:15	lainlives	or adb wireless
2015-08-14 22:00:19	lainlives	with adb-fs
2015-08-14 22:00:29	lainlives	my phone automaticallly mounts on my desktop when im on home wifi
2015-08-14 22:00:36	lainlives	with adbfs
2015-08-14 22:00:39	indeedwatson	huh that sounds really neat
2015-08-14 22:01:09	lainlives	indeedwatson: also you ever use your android as akb/mouse?
2015-08-14 22:01:19	lainlives	xmouse is best app for that, it only requires ssh and xtest
2015-08-14 22:01:26	lainlives	it doesnt need any bullshit drivers
2015-08-14 22:01:36	indeedwatson	mm no, im rarely far from my computer as to need that
2015-08-14 22:02:00	indeedwatson	i do need to learn ssh tho
2015-08-14 22:02:10	lainlives	you dont learn ssh, you just do it xD
2015-08-14 22:02:18	lainlives	connect to ssh, boom do normal terminal stuff
2015-08-14 22:02:24	indeedwatson	i tried once and i couldn't connect
2015-08-14 22:02:30	indeedwatson	im really bad at network stuff
2015-08-14 22:02:32	lainlives	did you set an exception in your firewall?
2015-08-14 22:02:52	lainlives	most distros close all ports by default (as they should, not like windows ME)
2015-08-14 22:02:58	indeedwatson	right now transmission has the port closed and i haven't looked how to open it
2015-08-14 22:03:05	lainlives	what distro?
2015-08-14 22:03:09	indeedwatson	fedora
2015-08-14 22:03:20	lainlives	firewall-config
2015-08-14 22:03:22	lainlives	its graphical
2015-08-14 22:03:43	indeedwatson	oh that's nice
2015-08-14 22:03:56	lainlives	:3
2015-08-14 22:04:17	lainlives	indeedwatson: if you set an exception, be sure to do the runtime to permanent function
2015-08-14 22:04:30	indeedwatson	uhh, it froze
2015-08-14 22:04:31	lainlives	as changes are not persistant unless you write them to the config with that button
2015-08-14 22:04:36	lainlives	give it a minute
2015-08-14 22:04:37	clammy	they wanted to ask a couple other backups
2015-08-14 22:04:41	lainlives	probably reading configs
2015-08-14 22:05:14	lainlives	it does seem to be a buggy tool so maybe try again
2015-08-14 22:05:19	lainlives	but its nice
2015-08-14 22:05:27	indeedwatson	i opened it from dmenu and it said no permition
2015-08-14 22:05:35	lainlives	it has to be run with sudo
2015-08-14 22:05:42	lainlives	or as su
2015-08-14 22:05:44	lainlives	eeither way
2015-08-14 22:05:44	indeedwatson	if i open from terminal with sudo it's just a blank window
2015-08-14 22:05:52	lainlives	:\
2015-08-14 22:08:00	logiz	the only thing you need to know with ssh is that you should setup your ssh config
2015-08-14 22:08:10	logiz	then tell everything which identity file to use, which user to log in as, ad which port
2015-08-14 22:08:13	logiz	ezpz
2015-08-14 22:08:19	lainlives	and forward whatever port you configured it for
2015-08-14 22:08:50	lainlives	i have mine local only though, but i VPN into my home network when i need ssh
2015-08-14 22:09:16	logiz	all ports should be forward you don't want backwards ports
2015-08-14 22:09:17	indeedwatson	well i dont think firewall-config is gonna do anything, the terminal gives me a long list about things being deprecated and nothing happens
2015-08-14 22:09:31	logiz	use firewalld
2015-08-14 22:09:41	lainlives	he is
2015-08-14 22:09:48	lainlives	firewall-config is fedora's graphical config for it
2015-08-14 22:10:16	logiz	isn't that for iptables?
2015-08-14 22:10:38	indeedwatson	what's weird is that if i open it from dmenu i can see the UI
2015-08-14 22:10:48	logiz	apparently it is for firewalld today I learn
2015-08-14 22:11:05	lainlives	indeedwatson: use firewall-cmd then
2015-08-14 22:11:09	lainlives	its the cli tool for the same function
2015-08-14 22:11:33	lainlives	man firewall-cmd
2015-08-14 22:11:40	logiz	nomanual page!
2015-08-14 22:11:43	lainlives	fuck you clammy for not knowing about firewall-cmd
2015-08-14 22:11:49	logiz	man firewalld
2015-08-14 22:11:58	lainlives	the bot is just dead
2015-08-14 22:11:58	logiz	this is fucking weird

2015-08-14 22:22:01	lainlives	it never got stuck again
2015-08-14 22:22:06	lainlives	maybe im in the minority?

2015-08-14 23:36:13	twitchytoes	When I first started using it, I nearly cried from frustration.
2015-08-14 23:36:38	dhscholb	yeah, my first stab at it didn't last long
2015-08-14 23:37:04	twitchytoes	I used XFCE for like 2 weeks
2015-08-14 23:37:06	twitchytoes	And now I'm back at it
2015-08-14 23:37:06	dhscholb	but now i can't imagine going back to any of the major DEs
2015-08-14 23:37:14	pheonixwork	I wish I could make the excuse I was new...
2015-08-14 23:37:27	twitchytoes	I moved the mod to caps lock and caps lock to right alt
2015-08-14 23:37:32	twitchytoes	Only way I could bear using it
2015-08-14 23:37:32	pheonixwork	so, I'll make the excuse that the hardware in my laptop is jacked
2015-08-14 23:37:51	twitchytoes	pheonixwork, M$ fault mate.
2015-08-14 23:37:57	pheonixwork	truth

2015-08-14 23:38:25	dhscholb	meh, using windows key as mod works fine for me
2015-08-14 23:38:46	twitchytoes	My hands are small so the shortcuts are a bear for me.
2015-08-14 23:39:00	twitchytoes	Pressing caps lock for mod and reaching to 7 is nearly my limit
2015-08-14 23:39:11	indeedwatson	my hands are big but i hate twisting my hand in odd ways
2015-08-14 23:39:12	pheonixwork	I think I'll just build gentoo when I go home...
2015-08-14 23:39:25	twitchytoes	I'm using Ubuntu.
2015-08-14 23:39:30	indeedwatson	i can stretch from capslock to 9
2015-08-14 23:39:34	twitchytoes	Mainly because I'm too lazy to reconfigure everything again.
2015-08-14 23:39:37	twitchytoes	indeedwatson, Lucky.
2015-08-14 23:39:54	indeedwatson	yea, i play piano so it'd suck to have small hands
2015-08-14 23:39:55	pheonixwork	just checked.  Caps to =
2015-08-14 23:40:04	twitchytoes	Holy hell
2015-08-14 23:40:15	twitchytoes	Using pinky and thumb, I can reach 9
2015-08-14 23:40:20	twitchytoes	0 if I stretch
2015-08-14 23:40:20	clammy	I've got 2x dvd with it
2015-08-14 23:40:35	twitchytoes	But I normally use pinky + pointer.
2015-08-14 23:41:05	indeedwatson	pinky and thumb i can reach =
2015-08-14 23:41:08	indeedwatson	almost backspace
2015-08-14 23:41:38	twitchytoes	Jesus
2015-08-14 23:41:52	indeedwatson	but regardless of hand size, having to press 2 keys at once that are in the same vertical colum is just awkward
2015-08-14 23:41:58	clammy	tier 1 support for it
2015-08-14 23:42:07	indeedwatson	twitchytoes: we might have different keyboard sizes or something
2015-08-14 23:42:12	dhscholb	full size kewyboards should have a left and right super, so you could use either one to avoid finger stretching
2015-08-14 23:42:19	twitchytoes	I don't use super
2015-08-14 23:42:29	dhscholb	but if you did :D
2015-08-14 23:42:29	twitchytoes	The contortions don't work for me
2015-08-14 23:42:40	indeedwatson	who uses right hand modifiers anyway ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2015-08-14 23:42:43	twitchytoes	And alt is bad for workspace switching for me.
2015-08-14 23:42:45	dhscholb	me
2015-08-14 23:42:52	twitchytoes	Caps lock has made me happy today
2015-08-14 23:43:05	twitchytoes	Just relearning the location of the literal caps lock function
2015-08-14 23:43:17	twitchytoes	Just gotta move my thumb right
2015-08-14 23:43:36	indeedwatson	in windows i mapped capslock + a or d to move tabs left or right, and capslock + w to close tabs, i really liked that
2015-08-14 23:43:43	dhscholb	i would probably have carpal tunnel if i only used the left modifiers
2015-08-14 23:43:56	indeedwatson	i should do the same here but i need to rework the i3 defaults
2015-08-14 23:44:06	indeedwatson	dhscholb: not if you use capslock
2015-08-14 23:44:10	twitchytoes	Ugh I hope I can get this 16gb ram kit.
2015-08-14 23:44:22	pheonixwork	if I didn't have to use my windows vdi for work
2015-08-14 23:44:22	indeedwatson	lol i have 4gb :(
2015-08-14 23:44:33	pheonixwork	I'd have a tiling WM
2015-08-14 23:44:40	twitchytoes	I'm hitting 4.5gb with just dota and irc and chrome
2015-08-14 23:44:48	twitchytoes	Chrome taking about 1.4gb itself
2015-08-14 23:44:54	indeedwatson	ew chrome
2015-08-14 23:44:55	dhscholb	indeedwatson: well, there's also ctrl and alt to worry about
2015-08-14 23:45:03	indeedwatson	true
2015-08-14 23:45:10	indeedwatson	i should use right modifiers more
2015-08-14 23:45:27	indeedwatson	i just noticed im right handed but my typing is better with my left hand
2015-08-14 23:45:28	twitchytoes	I mostly only use right shift for my typing-shift purposes.
2015-08-14 23:45:33	indeedwatson	that's weird
2015-08-14 23:45:45	twitchytoes	I've never been a fan of left shift.
2015-08-14 23:45:48	indeedwatson	twitchytoes: me too, maybe it has something to do with gaming
2015-08-14 23:45:56	indeedwatson	do you game dhscholb 
2015-08-14 23:46:04	twitchytoes	And with tf2, I have issues with using ctrl for duck.
2015-08-14 23:46:07	twitchytoes	Because of my hand size.
2015-08-14 23:46:16	dhscholb	indeedwatson: not really
2015-08-14 23:46:20	twitchytoes	Shift is like 20x more natural
2015-08-14 23:46:38	pheonixwork	twitchytoes: are you one of those weird people who uses "c" for crouch?
2015-08-14 23:46:40	twitchytoes	Round starting.
2015-08-14 23:46:42	twitchytoes	pheonixwork, No
2015-08-14 23:46:51	twitchytoes	I typically use shift
2015-08-14 23:46:55	indeedwatson	or those people who use esdf instead of wasd
2015-08-14 23:47:05	pheonixwork	gross
2015-08-14 23:47:26	pheonixwork	esdf and ctrl for crouch is not happening for me
2015-08-14 23:47:33	indeedwatson	man there was a thread in r/tf2 about uncommon bindings
2015-08-14 23:47:46	indeedwatson	i wish i could find it, there were some real trippy ones
2015-08-14 23:48:11	indeedwatson	i think one guy shot with the space bar

2015-08-15 16:34:13	joegro	i currently have windows. i've been logging in and starting up an ubuntu VM to do basically everything i need day-to-day for the past few months
2015-08-15 16:35:40	joegro	the ms-office replacements/alternatives don't really do it for me but i think i want to start running it natively... i'm a bit worried that hardware drivers will make the switch difficult
2015-08-15 16:36:09	joegro	any advice for someone trying to go from a vm to actually booting into a linux based system?
2015-08-15 16:36:35	arlion	Sure, first start in a way you can still use both systems.

2015-08-15 16:37:07	arlion	Duel booting is a great way to start using linux full time, but in case you still need to do soemthing on your windows side, like your files, they will all still be there.
2015-08-15 16:37:43	arlion	This also gives you a chance to really test and troubleshoot your operating system.
2015-08-15 16:37:46	joegro	right. currently, i've mounted my 'data' drive through vmwaretools
2015-08-15 16:38:06	arlion	And you will be able to do the same through the Linux OS.
2015-08-15 16:38:08	joegro	is there anything different i need to do in order to handle the windows filesystem on that drive?
2015-08-15 16:38:31	joegro	cool.

2015-08-15 16:41:30	arlion	assuming you already have ntfs-3g installed
2015-08-15 16:41:49	joegro	okay, doesn't sound like it'll be an issue
2015-08-15 16:41:57	arlion	Naw, it's super easy
2015-08-15 16:42:06	arlion	Honestly, ubutnu will probally auto-mount it anyway
2015-08-15 16:42:11	arlion	If it doesn
2015-08-15 16:42:12	joegro	if i grab all the drivers off my motherboard manufacturer's site / graphics card manufacturer's site
2015-08-15 16:42:33	joegro	and then install ubuntu onto a separate drive
2015-08-15 16:42:52	joegro	i should just be able to follow these instructions to mount the windows drive and install the drivers from there?
2015-08-15 16:43:40	arlion	You shouldn't need to install any drivers except for a graphics driver
2015-08-15 16:43:55	arlion	or wifi driver depending on what wifi card you have
2015-08-15 16:44:35	joegro	interesting... i have a wifi card but i'm typically plugged into the lan 
2015-08-15 16:45:01	arlion	laptop or desktop?
2015-08-15 16:45:06	joegro	i guess all i need to start will be AMD drivers
2015-08-15 16:45:08	joegro	desktop
2015-08-15 16:45:23	arlion	AMD drivers for your graphics card?
2015-08-15 16:45:25	joegro	yeah
2015-08-15 16:45:57	arlion	ubuntu "may" prompt you on your first setup to install your graphics card
2015-08-15 16:45:59	arlion	drivers
2015-08-15 16:46:08	arlion	Let me rephrase
2015-08-15 16:46:09	joegro	ok
2015-08-15 16:46:15	arlion	I'm hungover so bare with me
2015-08-15 16:46:24	joegro	haha no worries, this is a huge help
2015-08-15 16:47:08	arlion	When you complete the setup and you first boot into ubuntu. Ubutnu may ask you to install a set of their graphics drivers. Those should be all you need.
2015-08-15 16:47:27	arlion	If it doesn't, there is documentation for install amd drivers in ubuntu.
2015-08-15 16:47:36	joegro	i've read a lot lately about how bad AMD's linux drivers are
2015-08-15 16:47:53	arlion	Yeah, they suck. But that is suposidly changing
2015-08-15 16:48:21	arlion	Article was written a week or two ago stating that AMD is putting a lot more effort into deving amd linux drivers
2015-08-15 16:48:42	joegro	i'm hoping it'll start to get more attention with steam boxes etc
2015-08-15 16:50:06	arlion	That is also what i am hoping for.

2015-08-16 19:30:27	jrobeson	so this person is already farther ahead than that :)
2015-08-16 19:30:27	logiz	heh
2015-08-16 19:30:33	logiz	yah
2015-08-16 19:36:23	jrobeson	someone should do that relies on dbus/kdbus ..
2015-08-16 19:37:27	HappyMan	jrobeson knows his OSes in the biblical sense
2015-08-16 19:37:30	jrobeson	lol
2015-08-16 19:37:55	jrobeson	hmm.. i think tricot's new album is a bit less math rock like.. but I'm still digging it
2015-08-16 19:39:20	logiz	HappyMan: I'm looking for a distro where I have to allocate ram and clockspeed, how do?
2015-08-16 19:39:39	HappyMan	logiz: i think lfs is the best for your needs
2015-08-16 19:39:41	*	jrobeson turns down logiz clockspeed
2015-08-16 19:39:45	HappyMan	you start by building a fab for your processor
2015-08-16 19:39:52	logiz	D:
2015-08-16 19:39:54	jrobeson	cfs 
2015-08-16 19:39:58	clammy	jpleau: I still think you can compile the nvidia driver
2015-08-16 19:39:58	logiz	do I get to setup the alu?
2015-08-16 19:40:00	HappyMan	the first step to linux
2015-08-16 19:40:00	jrobeson	computers from scratch
2015-08-16 19:40:02	HappyMan	is supply chain managemenct
2015-08-16 19:40:12	HappyMan	because raw materials don't fall out of the sky
2015-08-16 19:40:15	HappyMan	you have to go to a beach and dig up sand
2015-08-16 19:40:31	logiz	what if I get glass instead of processor?
2015-08-16 19:40:38	HappyMan	get more sand and try again
2015-08-16 19:40:39	jrobeson	what about learning the fundamentals of electricity 
2015-08-16 19:40:49	jrobeson	and circuits 
2015-08-16 19:40:53	HappyMan	jrobeson: that's only if you don't have internet access
2015-08-16 19:41:13	jrobeson	but it sounds like you two are making fun of somebody?
2015-08-16 19:41:46	HappyMan	<muhandes> and by "build your experience from the ground up" I assume you mean more than choose your desktop style. Will I have to do things like install every driver that I need?
2015-08-16 19:41:46	HappyMan	<HappyMan> the base install gets you to a tty. what you do from there is all on you 
2015-08-16 19:41:46	HappyMan	<muhandes> will I have to set up ram allocation, clock speed and other really basic stuff or will that be set up leaving me to choose what type of desktop gui and programs i would like?
2015-08-16 19:42:35	HappyMan	logiz give me your cable credentials, my dad's in europe so i can't ask him for his and i wanna watch tv
2015-08-16 19:42:59	jrobeson	yeah. you shouldn't make fun of somebody like that
2015-08-16 19:43:25	HappyMan	i helped him, though
2015-08-16 19:43:50	jrobeson	or rather you shouldn't be making fun of somebody you aren't friends with like that .  that's more appropriate 
2015-08-16 19:43:56	HappyMan	i blame logiz
2015-08-16 19:43:59	HappyMan	he's a bad person
2015-08-16 19:44:11	jrobeson	hah
2015-08-16 19:44:16	logiz	HappyMan: I don't have cable
2015-08-16 19:44:25	HappyMan	it's probably just as well
2015-08-16 19:44:30	HappyMan	abc.com doesn't even work
2015-08-16 19:44:46	logiz	I'm not making fun of somebody, but it'd be kind of ridiculous having to setup everything the kernel is supposed to do, would be interesting to though
2015-08-16 19:45:07	logiz	I never had to setup the buses in dos, so, I'm glad for that
2015-08-16 19:45:20	HappyMan	oh
2015-08-16 19:45:30	HappyMan	i had to disable adblock for the scrolling js to load
2015-08-16 19:45:36	logiz	lol
2015-08-16 19:45:40	HappyMan	i forgot that technically abc would be blocked as a beacon
2015-08-16 19:45:44	logiz	I love when I have to disable adblock for something so stupid
2015-08-16 19:46:04	logiz	or whitelist ghostery so that I can look at some stupid jquery thing
2015-08-16 19:46:10	jpleau	last year I was debugging something, an image would load on a page I was developing
2015-08-16 19:46:14	jpleau	turns out it was adblock, fk
2015-08-16 19:46:16	HappyMan	ghostery just sells your stuff to ad providers anyway
2015-08-16 19:46:21	jpleau	would not load*
2015-08-16 19:46:23	HappyMan	use ff + adblock origin
2015-08-16 19:46:41	logiz	eh, you can turn off feedback from ghostery and it doesn't ping home
2015-08-16 19:46:49	logiz	ghostery is much more of an open company these days
2015-08-16 19:46:58	HappyMan	wow
2015-08-16 19:46:59	logiz	not saying they're not a business model
2015-08-16 19:47:04	HappyMan	cbs makes you pay to watch live tv over the internet
2015-08-16 19:47:04	jrobeson	privacybadger 
2015-08-16 19:47:05	HappyMan	turds
2015-08-16 19:47:14	logiz	a lot of places do
2015-08-16 19:47:16	jrobeson	privacy badger should be able to replace ghostery at some point
2015-08-16 19:47:20	HappyMan	not nbc or cbs
2015-08-16 19:47:22	jrobeson	i don't know if it does yet though
2015-08-16 19:47:28	logiz	smarter ones, like usa, let you watch mister robot, a day or two after it airs
2015-08-16 19:47:43	logiz	what would be much smarter would be to allow it when it airs, and a day after, then have it for paid users
2015-08-16 19:47:54	jrobeson	this is about contracts
2015-08-16 19:47:56	logiz	cause there are plenty of things I don't care about since I can't watch the episode when it airs
2015-08-16 19:47:58	jrobeson	not what's sane
2015-08-16 19:48:19	jrobeson	they don't wanna cannabilize their cable partners and video on demand too much.. not yet at least
2015-08-16 19:48:37	logiz	hmm
2015-08-16 19:48:42	logiz	I guess so
2015-08-16 19:48:50	logiz	never really thought about that part
2015-08-16 19:49:05	jrobeson	because if you took it at face value, they should show it at exactly the same time it airs on tv.. since they could both have ads
2015-08-16 19:49:16	logiz	yes
2015-08-16 19:49:20	twitchytoes	126 wpm, I'm proud.  I estimated myself at 110 or less. http://i.imgur.com/dcs7VI8.png
2015-08-16 19:49:23	jrobeson	but, that's not all their is 
2015-08-16 19:49:29	logiz	ofc not
2015-08-16 19:49:39	jrobeson	it's why hbo is only just now able to be bought on the web
2015-08-16 19:49:44	jrobeson	hbo subscription*
2015-08-16 19:49:48	jrobeson	web only rather
2015-08-16 19:49:49	logiz	that's because hbo is kind of backwards
2015-08-16 19:49:50	jpleau	twitchytoes: did you share it on facebook though?
2015-08-16 19:49:54	jrobeson	it's not that
2015-08-16 19:49:58	jrobeson	it's that they get money frm cable
2015-08-16 19:50:03	jrobeson	lots of money
2015-08-16 19:50:15	jrobeson	those cable providers have to pay them
2015-08-16 19:50:15	HappyMan	i think they all want that flash trusted credential thing, though
2015-08-16 19:50:16	twitchytoes	jpleau, Who actually does that shit?
2015-08-16 19:50:17	HappyMan	annoying
2015-08-16 19:50:30	logiz	but for individual shows they could recoup all the money they'd get from not having subscriptions
2015-08-16 19:50:32	HappyMan	who gives a shit, honestly, you've put it up on the internet for free, just let the people watch it
2015-08-16 19:50:34	jpleau	twitchytoes: if the button is there, probably a lot of people
2015-08-16 19:50:46	twitchytoes	jpleau, Not me.  I barely use facebook and I'm the admin of groups on facebook lol
2015-08-16 19:50:49	HappyMan	why ask some blackbox on my computer for some unneccessary nonsense
2015-08-16 19:50:56	twitchytoes	I'm a good admin, right?
2015-08-16 19:50:59	HappyMan	twitchytoes: maybe
2015-08-16 19:51:01	jrobeson	logiz, the balance has only just now started tipping in that direction
2015-08-16 19:51:07	HappyMan	depends on how angry you get at telecoms
2015-08-16 19:51:11	jpleau	twitchytoes: same, I have a facebook account because of work (have to test shit on it), and I'm admin of pretty big facebook pages lol. No idea how it works
2015-08-16 19:51:11	jrobeson	like.. just in the past year
2015-08-16 19:51:17	jrobeson	which is why they finally decided to do it
2015-08-16 19:51:21	jrobeson	not because they are backwards
2015-08-16 19:51:22	logiz	nah, hbo has proposed it at least 5 years back, their ceo just said no
2015-08-16 19:51:29	twitchytoes	But yeah, I'm super proud of that typing speed.
2015-08-16 19:51:31	jrobeson	yeah.. for money :)
2015-08-16 19:51:35	jrobeson	it's all about money
2015-08-16 19:51:39	jrobeson	not stupidity 
2015-08-16 19:51:40	logiz	but the models showed they'd have gained money
2015-08-16 19:51:42	twitchytoes	126 wpm.  I'm not really in practice either.
2015-08-16 19:51:42	clammy	Screw the credit card bill I couldn't propel myself
2015-08-16 19:51:55	logiz	it's not about giving up cable subscriptions, it's about extending their medai
2015-08-16 19:52:01	jrobeson	logiz, i think i read something like that. but was it really true?
2015-08-16 19:52:10	*	jrobeson trusts people to be greedy
2015-08-16 19:52:24	logiz	I think it was an inside company stat, not outside
2015-08-16 19:52:33	twitchytoes	Greed is just a fact of life.
2015-08-16 19:52:41	logiz	ofc there is a lot I don't know about hbo, so who am I to say
2015-08-16 19:52:59	logiz	I just know a lot of companies, even tech companies, run on premises that were built on a world before easily accessible content
2015-08-16 19:53:03	jrobeson	i wonder how much of a statistical certainty it was
2015-08-16 19:53:17	jrobeson	it could have been under 50% and then cross the the threshold
2015-08-16 19:53:27	jrobeson	of which they felt comfortable taking the risk
2015-08-16 19:53:28	logiz	well statistically important depends on context, medical stats are actually a lot lower for acceptance than people expect
2015-08-16 19:53:29	jrobeson	that's how i imagined it
2015-08-16 19:53:36	twitchytoes	Still getting the hang of managing tiled windows, but I'm starting to like i3.
2015-08-16 19:53:39	jrobeson	of course.. but the context is clear :)
2015-08-16 19:53:43	jrobeson	we're talking about hbo
2015-08-16 19:54:01	logiz	I don't think it's that clear, unless we group everybody as the same type of user
2015-08-16 19:54:10	logiz	there are people that will pirate silicon valley because they don't have hbo
2015-08-16 19:54:14	logiz	they're also the same demographic as the show
2015-08-16 19:54:46	logiz	I feel like hbo used to cost a lot more money though
2015-08-16 19:54:57	logiz	5 bucks a month isn't bad and you can usually get it free if you buy cable at the right time
2015-08-16 19:55:23	logiz	I don't understand people "cutting the cord" when I can get hbo and like 500 channels for like 5 bucks a month
2015-08-16 19:55:26	logiz	lol
2015-08-16 19:55:35	logiz	cheaper than netflix!
2015-08-16 19:55:45	logiz	and hbo is tight because it has all their stuff free on demand
2015-08-16 19:56:30	twitchytoes	Do any of the default i3 shortcuts use mod+ctrl?
2015-08-16 19:56:52	logiz	no
2015-08-16 19:56:54	logiz	but
2015-08-16 19:56:57	jrobeson	it does depend on the cable company 
2015-08-16 19:57:02	logiz	you could not be a wanker and look in your rc file
2015-08-16 19:57:05	logiz	instead of asking this channel
2015-08-16 19:57:09	jrobeson	like.. comcast it's cheapter to have internet + tv at a lot of times than it is just just have internet
2015-08-16 19:57:18	jrobeson	that's the way it was in my last house
2015-08-16 19:57:22	logiz	yah
2015-08-16 19:57:27	twitchytoes	Scouring the i3 file vs asking someone who has experience is a big time difference.  It doesn't hurt you much to just say no.
2015-08-16 19:57:28	logiz	same with phone service
2015-08-16 19:57:35	twitchytoes	But thank you

2015-08-16 19:59:25	twitchytoes	My keyboards media keys are recognized but don't work.
2015-08-16 19:59:47	jrobeson	you gotta map em right?
2015-08-16 19:59:57	twitchytoes	Clementine sees them as what they are, media next for example
2015-08-16 19:59:58	jrobeson	use the program called xev 
2015-08-16 20:00:00	twitchytoes	But pressing them doesn't work.
2015-08-16 20:00:03	jrobeson	ah
2015-08-16 20:00:15	jrobeson	did they work fine in cinnamon before?
2015-08-16 20:00:25	jrobeson	or whatever last program you used
2015-08-16 20:00:27	jrobeson	er last DE*
2015-08-16 20:00:46	twitchytoes	Never used them lol

2015-08-16 20:01:56	logiz	you can probably alias them somehow though
2015-08-16 20:02:09	logiz	oh I'm responding to the wrong person

2015-08-16 20:02:28	jrobeson	err somewhen
2015-08-16 20:02:44	twitchytoes	I'm using ctrl+mod+arrows.  up for play/pause, down for stop, right/left for next and previous.
2015-08-16 20:02:47	twitchytoes	It makes sense to me.
2015-08-16 20:03:06	logiz	jrobeson: lol send a pull request cause I never noticed that before
2015-08-16 20:03:07	twitchytoes	Kind of like mod+f1 is chrome
2015-08-16 20:03:15	twitchytoes	Just makes sense to me lol
2015-08-16 20:04:19	twitchytoes	The media keys are much more of a reach.
2015-08-16 20:04:25	twitchytoes	So that is another reason to just ignore them.

2015-08-16 21:05:57	twitchytoes	logiz, Mind helping me with a snippet a sec?
2015-08-16 21:08:57	logiz	you should learn how to do it
2015-08-16 21:09:13	twitchytoes	Attempting to, just not sure what I'm doing wrong yet
2015-08-16 21:10:15	twitchytoes	I'm assuming it's the format but I'm attempting to have cpu's current voltage show up in i3status.  I have the location for the voltage reading but the format seems to be causing the issue.
2015-08-16 21:12:02	twitchytoes	For temperature, I have %degrees [degree symbol]C and that works, but doesn't seem to have an equivalent for voltage.
2015-08-16 21:12:57	logiz	I don't use i3status
2015-08-16 21:13:07	logiz	you should read the docs cause the example shows it
2015-08-16 21:13:14	twitchytoes	Hmm,. I wonder if I could pull the information from lm-sensors..
2015-08-16 21:13:53	logiz	you could, but it would suck, and since internal stuff is built into i3, you should use their example
2015-08-16 21:14:22	twitchytoes	There isn't an example for voltage haha, that's what I'm trying to do.  
2015-08-16 21:15:42	twitchytoes	It's the name of it..
2015-08-16 21:15:58	twitchytoes	Naming it cpu_temperature 1 prevents the exit code 1, but it doesn't show any info then..
2015-08-16 21:15:58	twitchytoes	Hmm
2015-08-16 21:20:35	twitchytoes	I'd say I can't do voltage..
2015-08-16 21:26:40	twitchytoes	Durrrr I didn't add it to order, however, I can't get it to show the output of the file now... Hmmmmmmmm
2015-08-16 21:35:09	logiz	jrobeson: thinking I should be a data scientist instead
2015-08-16 21:35:16	logiz	much more opportunities, or at least, fun interesting ones

2015-08-17 16:33:29	indeedwatson	anyone here use tiling wm other than i3?
2015-08-17 16:34:14	manfred	dwm
2015-08-17 16:34:19	manfred	it is super tiny
2015-08-17 16:34:22	manfred	i like it cause it uses tags
2015-08-17 16:34:46	indeedwatson	manfred: does it allow you to pin a window so it can remain fixed across workspaces?
2015-08-17 16:35:01	manfred	it doesn't use workspaces
2015-08-17 16:35:04	manfred	it uses tags
2015-08-17 16:35:07	manfred	but you can tag it with all the tags
2015-08-17 16:35:16	manfred	so it displays no matter which tags your are showing
2015-08-17 16:35:22	indeedwatson	hmm
2015-08-17 16:35:32	indeedwatson	how hard is it to configure?
2015-08-17 16:35:40	manfred	it is all in C
2015-08-17 16:35:44	manfred	so you configure the config.h
2015-08-17 16:35:50	manfred	you can do basically whatever you want with it though
2015-08-17 16:35:55	indeedwatson	i don't know C 
2015-08-17 16:36:07	manfred	that isn't necessary, just mostly copy and paste in the config.h file
2015-08-17 16:36:14	manfred	but it helps
2015-08-17 16:36:19	manfred	you will need to do searching for how to extend it
2015-08-17 16:36:26	manfred	it is decently documented in the config.h file
2015-08-17 16:36:37	indeedwatson	Did you try several wm before sticking with dwm?
2015-08-17 16:36:55	manfred	i started with dwm
2015-08-17 16:36:57	manfred	then tried i3
2015-08-17 16:36:58	manfred	xmonad
2015-08-17 16:37:02	manfred	and wmii
2015-08-17 16:37:54	manfred	no other wm implements them in tags the way dwm does
2015-08-17 16:37:58	manfred	when I was on xmonad
2015-08-17 16:38:03	manfred	i just found myself trying to recreate tags
2015-08-17 16:38:15	manfred	which you can do 
2015-08-17 16:38:16	manfred	http://xmonad.org/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/XMonad-Layout-DwmStyle.html

2015-08-17 16:38:24	manfred	but ... isn't really worth it when you could just use dwm
2015-08-17 16:38:28	indeedwatson	what is the main advantage of tags vs workspaces?

2015-08-17 16:38:39	manfred	so, with tags, you only have one workspace
2015-08-17 16:38:52	manfred	you just select which tags to display at one time
2015-08-17 16:39:02	manfred	so you cant have one tag be monocle or one tab be stack
2015-08-17 16:39:05	manfred	they are all one or the other
2015-08-17 16:39:13	manfred	now, there are patches to implement tags as workspaces
2015-08-17 16:39:18	manfred	but it gets hairy when you start combining tags
2015-08-17 16:39:29	manfred	lets say, i keep all my terminals tagged as 3, and my browser tagged as 4
2015-08-17 16:39:35	manfred	i could view all my terminals by viewing tag 3
2015-08-17 16:39:39	manfred	but maybe i want to see both

2015-08-17 16:39:54	manfred	so instead of moving my terminals to tag 4, i just show all windows tagged with 3 and 4
2015-08-17 16:40:30	indeedwatson	and how do they get arranged when you do that?
2015-08-17 16:41:31	manfred	it depends on how you configure it to arange them
2015-08-17 16:41:39	manfred	you can use monocle where they are all stacked on top of each other
2015-08-17 16:41:47	manfred	or the regular master/stack that tiling window managers use
2015-08-17 16:42:08	manfred	where windows open on the right side, and you can promote them from the stack to the master, and you can increase the number of windows in the master if you want
2015-08-17 16:42:11	manfred	indeedwatson: https://web.archive.org/web/20120315223826/http://lubutu.com/rant/dwm-faq

2015-08-17 16:42:44	manfred	that is a rant from one of the creaters of dwm on how dwm is different and for people to stop implementing workspaces on dwm
2015-08-17 16:44:06	indeedwatson	thanks
2015-08-17 16:44:18	indeedwatson	I'll try it 
2015-08-17 16:44:40	manfred	if you need workspaces, you can use this patch http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/historical/workspaces

2015-08-17 16:44:57	rat	Whoo! Marshmallow!
2015-08-17 16:45:04	rat	Although I personally prefer Mochi
2015-08-17 16:45:09	manfred	the default config.h is pretty solid though
2015-08-17 16:45:33	manfred	i tought myself to be used to it, so that I could just quickly install it on any machine and be in dwm
2015-08-17 16:45:49	logiz	dwm uses tags? interesting
2015-08-17 16:45:50	manfred	like when i do classes, i just have to install the -devel libraries, and i can be up and running in about 10 minutes
2015-08-17 16:46:56	logiz	indeedwatson: you can do what you want in i3 btw
2015-08-17 16:47:50	logiz	if you want an easier configuration it doesn't really get much easier than i3 or awesome, because you don't have to recompile
2015-08-17 16:49:24	logiz	it's kind of funny, I showed somebody i3 yesterday and they assumed I was using tmux, so I used tmux in another window and was like "this is a terminal multiplexer" "this is a tiling wm"
2015-08-17 16:54:00	indeedwatson	logiz: how do i get one window to stay fixed across workspaces?
2015-08-17 16:55:55	manfred	magic

2015-08-17 17:32:37	logiz	you're gonna have to set a callback function, the moves the window onto every workspace
2015-08-17 17:32:46	logiz	I'm not going to figure it out, but you can look into ipc if youwant

2015-08-18 18:24:16	nelsk	dude, install fedora and write python. python does everything c can do and you might learn something despite yourself
2015-08-18 18:24:32	Netsca	The website learncodethehardway.org is pretty good for learning code 
2015-08-18 18:24:59	logiz	Netsca: get out of here with emacs
2015-08-18 18:25:07	Netsca	What?
2015-08-18 18:25:08	logiz	learncodethehardway is also terrible

2015-08-18 18:26:26	logiz	too much time wasted in vim to ever try emacs again
2015-08-18 18:26:38	logiz	it was annoying when I first learned it, and I'm not giving up on vimscript
2015-08-18 18:26:38	JanJozefo	tehdubwebwub Start here: http://amzn.com/0071828982 
2015-08-18 18:26:47	logiz	also, vim is scriptable with python, and so is neovim
2015-08-18 18:26:51	JanJozefo	It'll teach you basic syntax

2015-08-18 18:29:05	steev	JanJozefo: yep, texas, i had to learn spanglish
2015-08-18 18:29:14	JanJozefo	When it finally clicks, your mind expands
2015-08-18 18:29:16	logiz	fyi, this is essentially the logiz channel
2015-08-18 18:29:28	nelsk	okay im new here, be gentle
2015-08-18 18:29:38	logiz	but yes, python can do anything C can do
2015-08-18 18:29:46	logiz	exept kernel level stuff, and that's debateable
2015-08-18 18:29:49	steev	lel
2015-08-18 18:30:01	logiz	just gotta be like import c_types, and wrap any C library you want
2015-08-18 18:30:16	nelsk	yeah i should qualify my earlier statement, but given the audience, i don't think that matters...

2015-08-18 19:09:04	jrobeson	linux is only better if you want to be able to do with linux offers
2015-08-18 19:09:19	jrobeson	if you don't really want to ever care how the computer works.. or how to work with it.. then don't use linux
2015-08-18 19:09:32	jrobeson	unless you can buy a computer with linux preinstalled.. in the same way you buy a windows computer

2015-08-18 19:10:22	nelsk	maybe it was the windows comment that did him in

2015-08-18 19:10:42	nelsk	well he made it as far as downloading the iso?

2015-08-18 19:11:20	steev	ubuntu didn't even exist when i was 12 :(
2015-08-18 19:11:25	steev	actually, the internet didn't either
2015-08-18 19:11:48	nelsk	im guessing he was double clicking the iso expecting to install it like an msi

2015-08-18 19:20:58	Netsca	I don't dislike or like them
2015-08-18 19:21:02	nelsk	I don't either, but some of my best friends do and feel very strongly about them. I respect that
2015-08-18 19:21:03	*	logiz is triggered by triggers
2015-08-18 19:21:25	logiz	I can't respect a friend that really loves guns
2015-08-18 19:21:35	steev	also, what the fuck is this
2015-08-18 19:21:37	logiz	like I don't care if a friend has a bunch, but once they start going full redneck
2015-08-18 19:21:40	jrobeson	lol
2015-08-18 19:21:50	jrobeson	i do'nt think "full redneck" is how you describe that
2015-08-18 19:21:54	steev	1st class passengers, then priority, then ruby and platinum priority
2015-08-18 19:21:56	jrobeson	full militia type maybe
2015-08-18 19:21:56	nelsk	I don't think it's strictly a power fantasy, people feel very strongly about protecting themselves and their loved ones and react pretty badly when you challenge what they consider their mechanism to perform that protection
2015-08-18 19:22:06	logiz	steev: don't get on a plane that has ruby
2015-08-18 19:22:08	Netsca	Well i thing the pico mail client is called alpine
2015-08-18 19:22:11	logiz	ruby is only made for rails
2015-08-18 19:22:13	Netsca	*Think*
2015-08-18 19:22:17	jrobeson	most "rednecks" are not nearly that bad when it comes to guns
2015-08-18 19:22:23	dimeshake	howdy jrobeson
2015-08-18 19:22:23	jrobeson	they hunt and eat their food.. i have no problem with that
2015-08-18 19:22:28	nelsk	steev: shoulda been a python guy -.-
2015-08-18 19:22:31	steev	i don't hunt, i just shoot for fun
2015-08-18 19:22:37	logiz	jrobeson: figuring I've lived in new york my entire life, you can probably color what my definition of redneck means
2015-08-18 19:22:40	dimeshake	plinkin' is where it's at.
2015-08-18 19:22:52	jrobeson	now killing animals for fun.. i don't think that's reasonable
2015-08-18 19:22:55	Netsca	Larry the cable guy right?
2015-08-18 19:22:56	steev	logiz: it means they have a red neck?
2015-08-18 19:23:01	logiz	yeah!
2015-08-18 19:23:04	dimeshake	ting ting twang, dang 'ol spinner goes spinny spin
2015-08-18 19:23:20	jrobeson	nelsk, i think that's a rationalization for most people
2015-08-18 19:23:24	steev	group 1!
2015-08-18 19:23:27	steev	only 2 more groups to go
2015-08-18 19:23:28	logiz	woo
2015-08-18 19:23:44	steev	but seriously, when you keep adding more "priority" groups... that's not really a priority
2015-08-18 19:23:47	jrobeson	nelsk, plus it's different for a person who actually lives in a dangerous neighborhood.. and those who really don't
2015-08-18 19:23:50	logiz	steev: I hope you sit next to a pretty girl from texas, and get married to her and have to suffer texas
2015-08-18 19:23:52	steev	not to mention
2015-08-18 19:23:56	nelsk	jrobeson: maybe, I don't purport to understand the psychology of it. that's a good point
2015-08-18 19:23:58	steev	logiz: won't happen
2015-08-18 19:24:03	steev	marriage and kids aren't my thing
2015-08-18 19:24:09	logiz	how about marriage and adults
2015-08-18 19:24:15	logiz	I think it's called "swinging"
2015-08-18 19:24:18	steev	i don't mind the making baby practice
2015-08-18 19:24:22	nelsk	I think if I did live in a particularly bad neighborhood and I had to raise my kids their because I didn't have a choice, I probably would look into a firearm
2015-08-18 19:24:26	steev	just, you know, i wanna keep being a failure at that
2015-08-18 19:24:30	logiz	steev: you can't make cookies without eating a bit of dough
2015-08-18 19:24:31	nelsk	I don't feel the need now and I don't really want guns around me
2015-08-18 19:24:36	steev	logiz: truth
2015-08-18 19:24:49	Netsca	Does anyone remmber how to change the editor mutt uses
2015-08-18 19:24:49	jrobeson	nelsk, yeah that's why i clarified.. some people actually do live in dangerous situations 
2015-08-18 19:24:54	logiz	yes
2015-08-18 19:24:54	steev	group 2!

2015-08-18 19:25:10	Netsca	Oh thanks
2015-08-18 19:25:12	dimeshake	no $ when export
2015-08-18 19:25:17	logiz	dimeshake: is right

2015-08-18 19:25:24	steev	so why does it matter how they board

2015-08-18 19:26:35	logiz	safe flight steev 
2015-08-18 19:26:52	logiz	nelsk: yeah seriously
2015-08-18 19:27:04	Netsca	I fucked my familys computer up installing ubuntu when i was younger
2015-08-18 19:27:05	nelsk	can you imagine coming home and having your entire machine wiped cuz your kid tried to install gentoo based on advice from a shitty irc channel?
2015-08-18 19:27:11	Netsca	I still have that ubuntu cd
2015-08-18 19:27:34	logiz	nelsk: where is this thread
2015-08-18 19:27:47	jrobeson	nelsk, that would suck.. i got lucky that when i started using linux.. my parents didnk't really use the computer at all
2015-08-18 19:27:49	logiz	see I couldn't fuck up a families computer when I was younger cause linux just sucked
2015-08-18 19:27:59	logiz	I fucked up my computer cause redhat was completely unusable
2015-08-18 19:28:01	logiz	and same with gentoo
2015-08-18 19:28:34	logiz	jrobeson: that's what you think, your dad was probably looking up porn before you
2015-08-18 19:28:39	jrobeson	my first disto was debian
2015-08-18 19:28:39	dimeshake	installed leenooks in 2002 while at college. bsd geek friend of mine had to ssh in and help me set up X
2015-08-18 19:28:42	dimeshake	it was glorious
2015-08-18 19:28:42	jrobeson	distro*
2015-08-18 19:28:53	HappyMan	lol setting up X
2015-08-18 19:28:56	HappyMan	i remember those halcyon days
2015-08-18 19:28:56	logiz	dimeshake: :)
2015-08-18 19:29:01	logiz	2002 was around the time I installed redhat

2015-08-18 19:29:07	logiz	23 hour installation
2015-08-18 19:29:19	clammy	Title: cool shiznit to do wit my new linux setup : linux (at www.reddit.com)
2015-08-18 19:29:24	jrobeson	my gentoo installation time measured in the days :)
2015-08-18 19:29:28	dimeshake	i think i got the distro from a "Sam's Teach Yourself LINUX in 24 hours, Featuring Red Hat 7.2! (FREE CD IN BACK!)"
2015-08-18 19:29:33	JanJozefo	How difficult is it to install ArchLinux?
2015-08-18 19:29:34	HappyMan	why do kids type like dumbasses
2015-08-18 19:29:42	jrobeson	dimeshake, mine was acd included with boot magazine
2015-08-18 19:29:42	HappyMan	JanJozefo: not hard at all, just a  bit more reading than you're used to :)
2015-08-18 19:29:52	JanJozefo	Good to know
2015-08-18 19:29:52	jrobeson	JanJozefo, is there any particular reason you want to use arch?
2015-08-18 19:29:54	HappyMan	and i don't mean that, like, filppantly
2015-08-18 19:29:59	*	jrobeson won't use arch ever
2015-08-18 19:30:02	JanJozefo	Chic factor, mostly
2015-08-18 19:30:04	HappyMan	the beginners' guide is just long
2015-08-18 19:30:17	HappyMan	jrobeson: i use arch at work :D get on my level
2015-08-18 19:30:18	dimeshake	thorough might be a better word
2015-08-18 19:30:18	jrobeson	i do occasionally read the wiki though
2015-08-18 19:30:22	logiz	dimeshake: I got redhat (probably an older version) from the library!
2015-08-18 19:30:34	Netsca	The arch wiki is the best
2015-08-18 19:30:45	jrobeson	HappyMan, arch just feels messy.. 
2015-08-18 19:30:57	logiz	don't forget, the gentoo wiki is pretty good too
2015-08-18 19:30:58	dimeshake	messy? huh.
2015-08-18 19:30:59	logiz	and so is fedoras
2015-08-18 19:30:59	jrobeson	and I am trying to buy into an opinionated experience.. so I use Fedora Workstation
2015-08-18 19:31:15	jrobeson	i don't wanna build a computer.. i want it to work :) 
2015-08-18 19:31:17	dimeshake	the gentoo wiki had to be rebuilt not long ago, didn't it?
2015-08-18 19:31:18	HappyMan	ah, well, i'm the exact opposite
2015-08-18 19:31:21	nelsk	jrobeson: totally disagree, I consider it's organization to be the primary reason to use it compared to any other distro
2015-08-18 19:31:22	HappyMan	the computer is my tool
2015-08-18 19:31:23	HappyMan	i'm not its tool
2015-08-18 19:31:27	nelsk	for desktop of course
2015-08-18 19:31:30	jrobeson	nelsk, gentoo is better than that regard 
2015-08-18 19:31:34	HappyMan	yo did we ban this kid from irc?
2015-08-18 19:31:34	logiz	dimeshake: did it? I think I used it a month or two ago to do something I was trying to do
2015-08-18 19:31:38	HappyMan	dimeshake: do you remember this kid
2015-08-18 19:31:40	jrobeson	gentoo is so much more sane
2015-08-18 19:31:45	HappyMan	>gentoo
2015-08-18 19:31:46	HappyMan	>sane
2015-08-18 19:31:51	HappyMan	>/g/ spotted
2015-08-18 19:32:02	logiz	> HappyMan spotted
2015-08-18 19:32:17	HappyMan	>cool kid arrows detected
2015-08-18 19:32:18	dimeshake	used gentoo for a time. definitely prefer arch myself
2015-08-18 19:32:34	nelsk	yeah I did the arch > funtoo > arch thing
2015-08-18 19:32:35	logiz	agreed for the most part, but there were some nice things about gentoo
2015-08-18 19:32:39	logiz	like switching your graphics on the fly
2015-08-18 19:32:40	jrobeson	maybe arch will be better once there's another distro for all those coolkids to jump to
2015-08-18 19:32:44	nelsk	mainly just because I'm not interested in compile times anymore
2015-08-18 19:32:58	nelsk	but *untoo is obviously the tweaker's home
2015-08-18 19:32:59	HappyMan	jrobeson: the cool kids use kali these days, i find
2015-08-18 19:33:06	dimeshake	totally
2015-08-18 19:33:15	jrobeson	not enough to make a dent into arch's userbase 
2015-08-18 19:33:18	logiz	I laugh everytime somebody uses kali
2015-08-18 19:33:29	dimeshake	HappyMan: i put a +q mask on him a little while ago - like 20 minutes or something
2015-08-18 19:33:30	nelsk	is kali anything more than just some convenient packages intalled for a particular crowd?
2015-08-18 19:33:41	HappyMan	oh, rofl
2015-08-18 19:33:44	jrobeson	it's gotta be more than that
2015-08-18 19:33:45	logiz	if you asked that like 5 minutes ago one of the people coudl have told you
2015-08-18 19:33:59	jrobeson	probably custom configuration 
2015-08-18 19:33:59	logiz	I just know kali as backtrack
2015-08-18 19:34:09	HappyMan	kali is basically a distro designed to be a good home for a wide variety of pentesting and cracking tools
2015-08-18 19:34:19	logiz	"pentesting"
2015-08-18 19:34:21	jrobeson	why wouldn't i just install those tools?
2015-08-18 19:34:23	Netsca	The only regular compiling i do is the kernel
2015-08-18 19:34:30	logiz	jrobeson: because you want to feel uber leet
2015-08-18 19:34:38	HappyMan	jrobeson: because you want those tools to "just work" :P
2015-08-18 19:34:41	Netsca	You mean 1337
2015-08-18 19:34:47	JanJozefo	I recompile the kernel every night before going to bed
2015-08-18 19:34:49	logiz	Netsca: that shows up as leet for me
2015-08-18 19:34:49	jrobeson	Netsca, i have to compile softwre all the time .. 
2015-08-18 19:34:51	JanJozefo	It makes me feel good
2015-08-18 19:34:54	logiz	I don't have a numeric fonttype
2015-08-18 19:34:58	jrobeson	i'm a programmer.. i'm always compiling stuff 
2015-08-18 19:35:04	*	logiz uses reverseleetfont.tty
2015-08-18 19:35:05	nelsk	jrobeson: yeah that's my question. what does kali offer me aside from just installing nmap on my debian setup
2015-08-18 19:35:07	HappyMan	i compile stuff like twice an hour
2015-08-18 19:35:10	jrobeson	nelsk, i have no idea
2015-08-18 19:35:21	jrobeson	the software involved isn't that interesting to me 
2015-08-18 19:35:22	Netsca	Dem cool graphics
2015-08-18 19:35:27	jrobeson	i prefer making stuff over breakign it
2015-08-18 19:35:31	Netsca	I mean wallpaper 
2015-08-18 19:35:37	clammy	adapter: I'm dumb
2015-08-18 19:35:43	logiz	jrobeson: it's not interesting to you because you're not some 16 year old kid "learning pentesting" by hacking their neighbors
2015-08-18 19:35:45	Netsca	And its a live distro so you can out it ona flash drive
2015-08-18 19:35:47	HappyMan	nelsk: lots more than nmap... off the top of my head, it had all of metasploit set up and ready to go, jack the ripper, all the cifs/smbclient tools, lots of custom little things that you can't find on the open internet anymore, network sniffing tools
2015-08-18 19:35:48	HappyMan	lots of crap
2015-08-18 19:35:55	jrobeson	logiz, is that really the audience?
2015-08-18 19:35:56	HappyMan	all set up to co-exist comfortably together
2015-08-18 19:35:57	logiz	yes
2015-08-18 19:35:59	logiz	well
2015-08-18 19:36:04	logiz	the public facing audience yes

2015-08-18 19:36:12	HappyMan	very useful if you're a pentester
2015-08-18 19:36:18	logiz	I'm sure that's not who they market it to
2015-08-18 19:36:22	HappyMan	completely useless if you are a wannabe l33t k1dd13
2015-08-18 19:36:25	logiz	^
2015-08-18 19:36:30	jrobeson	HappyMan, didn't they make appropriate reusable debian packages for those tools you're referring to?
2015-08-18 19:36:46	HappyMan	jrobeson: they did, but they also make a distro that has it all installed already. no harm there
2015-08-18 19:36:53	logiz	I've seen at least a few job postings that said "bonus points if you know kali"
2015-08-18 19:36:54	HappyMan	i don't blame kali for the kids using it
2015-08-18 19:36:58	logiz	neither do I
2015-08-18 19:37:03	Netsca	My school sent a printer and i was pleasantly suprised it worked just fine on debian just had install the HPLP or HPLIP stuff
2015-08-18 19:37:10	logiz	it's got its place, but it's the same with arch
2015-08-18 19:37:28	logiz	when you hear arch on reddit you hear the kid that installed arch and has only been using linux for 2 months saying that they know how to do everything
2015-08-18 19:37:37	*	HappyMan shrugs
2015-08-18 19:37:38	HappyMan	maybe
2015-08-18 19:37:42	logiz	how they are like "omg i'm customizing my kernel and I'm so better than you, OH FUCK THIS ITS NOT WORKING"
2015-08-18 19:37:48	HappyMan	i use arch because it gets out of my way the most
2015-08-18 19:37:51	dimeshake	^^
2015-08-18 19:37:57	logiz	which is a legitimate reason to use it
2015-08-18 19:38:14	logiz	but a lot of people don't get that

2015-08-18 19:57:06	logiz	tim pope doesn't have a python plugin

2015-08-18 19:57:28	logiz	and ruby is the same as python for vim purpose
2015-08-18 19:57:36	jrobeson	you're the same as ruby
2015-08-18 19:57:37	logiz	since you're manipulating vim objects that don't exist outside the editor

2015-08-18 19:58:24	HappyMan	we used it a lot back when i was in security
2015-08-18 19:58:26	jrobeson	and whatever a vim is
2015-08-18 19:58:28	nelsk	okay cool, was just curious if there was any utility beyond just a preconfigured set of packages
2015-08-18 19:59:08	nelsk	i feel bad about that kid, we should at least point him to an ubuntu install guide
2015-08-18 19:59:16	nelsk	gonna post on his thread

2015-08-18 19:59:35	Netsca	What thread is it

2015-08-18 20:24:10	logiz	yeah that kid'll probably be smarter than me when he hits my age

2015-08-18 20:24:26	logiz	when I was 13 I was taking books out of the library
2015-08-18 20:24:34	logiz	I guess libraries are kind of bunk for kids these days

2015-08-18 20:25:50	logiz	idk who that other kid talking about gentoo was, but probably the noise from it made it hard to follow this stuff
2015-08-18 20:26:09	nelsk	he probably stumbled on some 4chan shit

2015-08-18 20:27:12	logiz	cause then they're like "oh you're using arch?"
2015-08-18 20:27:14	logiz	no fedora
2015-08-18 20:27:17	Netsca	What are they like?
2015-08-18 20:27:18	logiz	"it doesn't look like fedora"
2015-08-18 20:27:22	logiz	it's fedora
2015-08-18 20:27:28	logiz	but where are the windows
2015-08-18 20:27:30	logiz	these are windows
2015-08-18 20:27:34	logiz	butmine doesn't look like that

2015-08-18 20:27:41	logiz	oh
2015-08-18 20:27:53	nelsk	I tried hard with fedora
2015-08-18 20:28:10	logiz	so now I have to preface everything i say with
2015-08-18 20:28:22	logiz	"I use fedora, but it doesn't look like fedora, because of i3 and other stuff"
2015-08-18 20:28:38	nelsk	with new releases, shits too broke, docs don't standup when compared to arch, and i'm just not familiar with the rpm families
2015-08-18 20:28:52	logiz	docs are really well, you probably just didn't read them right :P
2015-08-18 20:28:57	logiz	they're also written differently
2015-08-18 20:28:59	nelsk	probably
2015-08-18 20:29:01	logiz	more for administration

2015-08-18 20:30:46	logiz	alright I"m going to actually get soup now
2015-08-18 20:30:47	logiz	lmao

2015-08-18 20:31:31	nelsk	oh yeah. that
2015-08-18 20:31:53	nelsk	I forced myself to use centos 7 on my home server
2015-08-18 20:32:13	nelsk	still don't really like using it, but I want some base level of understanding with the rpm crowd
2015-08-18 20:32:23	Netsca	Why not debian stable?
2015-08-18 20:33:49	nelsk	Under normal circumstances, that's what'd I'd use
2015-08-18 20:33:56	nelsk	I specifically wanted an rpm distro
2015-08-18 20:34:20	JanJozefo	Why?
2015-08-18 20:34:29	nelsk	learning purposes, never used one!
2015-08-18 20:34:35	JanJozefo	Oh, I see
2015-08-18 20:34:42	nelsk	home server, no downside
2015-08-18 20:34:49	nelsk	I've got debian in prod everywhere
2015-08-18 20:35:10	JanJozefo	I've been fiddling around with Slax for a while now
2015-08-18 20:35:16	JanJozefo	And I love it
2015-08-18 20:35:21	nelsk	very much dislike canonical and their direction as of late, won't touch a *buntu for anything I use anymore
2015-08-18 20:35:27	nelsk	just migrated my last Xubuntu box
2015-08-18 20:35:39	nelsk	Don't think I've heard of slax
2015-08-18 20:35:57	JanJozefo	I personally like Lubuntu
2015-08-18 20:36:11	JanJozefo	But god, I hate Unity's guts
2015-08-18 20:36:15	JanJozefo	And gnome
2015-08-18 20:36:36	Netsca	I prefer i3wm
2015-08-18 20:36:53	nelsk	I don't have any particular love for gnome, but I find it to be the most usable
2015-08-18 20:37:08	nelsk	requires the least amount of config, just works the way I expect and gets out of the way
2015-08-18 20:37:34	nelsk	<3 i3, I find I need floating windows too much in my workflow though
2015-08-18 20:39:07	Netsca	Yeah if i had to use a computer that i couldnt change in any way at all id prefer gnome
2015-08-18 20:39:59	nelsk	openbox is great, I mean to get myself a proper setup with it at some point
2015-08-18 20:40:33	Netsca	I use to use openbox then i switched to i3wm

2015-08-18 20:49:39	logiz	it's going pretty awesome
2015-08-18 20:49:52	logiz	I need another show to watch

2015-08-18 21:07:10	nelsk	just decided to finally redo my whole setup proper, ordered a new desk, monitor mount and mic mount
2015-08-18 21:07:13	nelsk	excited
2015-08-18 21:07:17	nelsk	it's about time
2015-08-18 21:07:25	HappyMan	anybody have a recommendation for a good desk-clamped monitor mount
2015-08-18 21:07:33	HappyMan	so long as we're talking about desks 
2015-08-18 21:07:37	indeedwatson	my monitor mount is a box
2015-08-18 21:07:54	nelsk	I'd send over mine but I haven't been able to set it up yet so I can recommend it in good faith
2015-08-18 21:08:44	nelsk	if you're looking for a desk though, can't recommend the ikea bekants enough: http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S69006392/#/S29006394
2015-08-18 21:08:44		[ http://is.gd/lffvWd ]
2015-08-18 21:08:47	HappyMan	yes
2015-08-18 21:08:49	HappyMan	i have a bekant
2015-08-18 21:08:54	HappyMan	not as good as the galant
2015-08-18 21:08:55	HappyMan	but good enough
2015-08-18 21:09:00	HappyMan	rip galant :(
2015-08-18 21:09:02	nelsk	I missed out on the galant :(
2015-08-18 21:09:17	nelsk	curious, howcome you prefer the galant?
2015-08-18 21:09:28	nelsk	i see this being a common sentiment
2015-08-18 21:09:55	HappyMan	it's much more modular, had that super awesome curved bit that you could use as a center, extremely stable
2015-08-18 21:10:08	HappyMan	my mother's got one for her home office, and i've never been more impressed by a desk setup
2015-08-18 21:10:11	nelsk	does it matter if i'm not pairing it with another desk?
2015-08-18 21:10:44	HappyMan	galants were best as corner desks
2015-08-18 21:10:53	HappyMan	you'd put in in a corner and have enough space to do anything you wanted
2015-08-18 21:11:00	HappyMan	frequently multiple somethings
2015-08-18 21:13:03	nelsk	is the bekant corner inferior?
2015-08-18 21:13:22	HappyMan	it's not as spacious
2015-08-18 21:13:28	nelsk	I'm excited to get mine fully setup, just waiting for my hardware to come in
2015-08-18 21:13:34	nelsk	ah
2015-08-18 21:13:41	HappyMan	don't get me wrong, i'm typing to you from on top of a bekant right now
2015-08-18 21:14:02	HappyMan	it's just... it's not a galant, which is the only desk i've ever been seriously impressed by for its virtues _as a desk_
2015-08-18 21:14:16	nelsk	when I was considering my options I had some pushback from other channels arguing it was expensive for what it was - do you feel that way?
2015-08-18 21:14:25	nelsk	nobody could really link me something better for the price though
2015-08-18 21:14:30	nelsk	(for what I was looking for)
2015-08-18 21:14:44	nelsk	what happened to your old one?
2015-08-18 21:15:15	HappyMan	nothing
2015-08-18 21:15:23	HappyMan	my mom had the galant
2015-08-18 21:15:26	HappyMan	well, has
2015-08-18 21:15:31	HappyMan	i was the one who put it together for her
2015-08-18 21:15:41	nelsk	ah
2015-08-18 21:15:54	HappyMan	and i've been in her office extensively because it's a home office, so i have experience sitting at it and using it 
2015-08-18 21:16:16	HappyMan	and yeah, it was pricey
2015-08-18 21:16:17	HappyMan	but worth it
2015-08-18 21:16:30	HappyMan	desk like that is an investment
2015-08-18 21:16:43	HappyMan	i will say, though, that the bekant has had more attention paid to ease of disassembly than the galant
2015-08-18 21:16:58	nelsk	230 bucks is very affordanble for something as important as a desk imo
2015-08-18 21:17:06	HappyMan	absolutely
2015-08-18 21:17:21	nelsk	I wouldn't blink at spending 1k on a chair given I spend much of my waking life there

2015-08-18 21:24:44	nelsk	i messed up my shoulder playing sports and every chair i've come across aggrivates it except the aeron I used to use
2015-08-18 21:25:09	nelsk	not ready to drop that cash on something like that though if I can find one that suits my needs for cheaper
2015-08-18 21:25:29	nelsk	might be my desk too and the height of my kb/mouse, not sure yet

2015-08-18 21:39:04	HappyMan	whichever makse you happier
2015-08-18 21:39:09	nelsk	i torrent 'em
2015-08-18 21:39:49	logiz	yes
2015-08-18 21:39:58	Netsca	Torrenting isnt very nice to anyone using the same network as me 
2015-08-18 21:40:10	logiz	why?
2015-08-18 21:40:12	Netsca	makes everything slow as shit
2015-08-18 21:40:21	logiz	because of upload?
2015-08-18 21:40:23	Netsca	Internet wise
2015-08-18 21:40:35	logiz	download should be using the same amount of bandwidth
2015-08-18 21:40:39	Netsca	I'm not sure
2015-08-18 21:40:57	Netsca	It doesnt seem like its uploading much
2015-08-18 21:41:08	nelsk	what network are you on that's broadly shared?
2015-08-18 21:41:26	logiz	man wget -c
2015-08-18 21:41:26	onetwouser	-c:  --continue:  -c:  --continue: 
2015-08-18 21:41:42	nelsk	i mean, you can limit your upload
2015-08-18 21:43:25	Netsca	Not many people are on the network at the same time but i've got directtv and if i torrent an iso and watch something from ondemand on tv which uses internet it buffers so much its impossible and it takes 10 or 15 seconds to load a page
2015-08-18 21:43:40	Netsca	*web page*
2015-08-18 21:44:52	Netsca	my upload speed is unlimited i should change that
2015-08-18 21:46:09	Netsca	My network speed is 7 megabytes down less than one megabyte up like .65
2015-08-18 21:46:22	HappyMan	i don't understand how you live
2015-08-18 21:46:31	HappyMan	nevertheless, yes, for you throttling upstream is a necessity
2015-08-18 21:46:46	Netsca	I mean i can watch netflix when i'm not torrenting
2015-08-18 21:46:48	HappyMan	hell, i'd just not let your torrents seed at all
2015-08-18 21:47:05	HappyMan	you don't have enough bandwidth to handle tcp syn/ack cycles 
2015-08-18 21:47:09	Netsca	I'm using deluge
2015-08-18 21:47:10	HappyMan	when your downlink is saturated
2015-08-18 21:48:08	HappyMan	torrenting is UDP based with checksums, so there's no tcp syn/ack clogging up the torrent transmission in either direction
2015-08-18 21:48:18	HappyMan	however, most internet stuff is tcp-based, which relies on syn/ack
2015-08-18 21:48:38	HappyMan	and you literally don't have enough upstream bandwidth to negotiate those when your entire downlink is saturated
2015-08-18 21:49:00	HappyMan	honestly i'd suggest filing with the FCC if you're in the states
2015-08-18 21:49:11	HappyMan	or whatever you can do to get maybe double your upstream if you're not
2015-08-18 21:49:52	Netsca	What do you mean filing with the FCC my network comes through the phone line though
2015-08-18 21:50:13	HappyMan	DSL?
2015-08-18 21:50:40	Netsca	I think so

2015-08-18 21:53:19	logiz	I can show you all the soup locations

2015-08-18 21:53:43	Netsca	Whats your favorite soup logiz?
2015-08-18 21:53:43	nelsk	should learn more about it

2015-08-18 22:12:05	jpleau	logiz: auto x = 'yourmom' is actually an error I believe
2015-08-18 22:12:13	jpleau	bad logiz
2015-08-18 22:12:14	logiz	thanks jpleau I was hoping you'd show up
2015-08-18 22:12:37	logiz	and i'm doubly glad cause just seeing yoru name reminded me that I was going to learn sfml
2015-08-18 22:12:41	jpleau	Can't let those errors freely run u know
2015-08-18 22:12:50	jpleau	.w
2015-08-18 22:12:51	HappyMan	ah, yes, i remember this post

2015-08-18 22:12:57	nelsk	oh they're on express
2015-08-18 22:13:02	HappyMan	it turned out that express had no idea how to use maps
2015-08-18 22:13:02	clammy	nope, I'm not doing it
2015-08-18 22:13:13	HappyMan	like i said, the tooling around node is a primary reason why i am wary of it
2015-08-18 22:13:16	nelsk	yep
2015-08-18 22:13:27	nelsk	that's a strong point
2015-08-18 22:13:30	jpleau	Why can't we keep JS in the browser
2015-08-18 22:13:33	logiz	jpleau: is my compiler
2015-08-18 22:13:48	nelsk	jpleau: JS doesn't have to stay in the browser to be viable
2015-08-18 22:13:58	logiz	hey jpleau why does snoop dog carry an umbrella?
2015-08-18 22:13:59	nelsk	I'll argue the ecosystem isn't mature yet
2015-08-18 22:14:05	jpleau	nelsk: lol
2015-08-18 22:14:09	Netsca	What are some uses for ruby?

2015-08-18 22:15:33	logiz	nelsk: just call up your old company and tellt hem to hire me
2015-08-18 22:15:36	logiz	kthnkxbai
2015-08-18 22:15:55	logiz	also js is faster than python so that's at least one reason to use it
2015-08-18 22:16:55	logiz	I think I'm going to use opencv on porn videos to try to identify people by faces, and then sell it
2015-08-18 22:17:00	logiz	I could make so much money
2015-08-18 22:17:49	nelsk	21:15 < logiz> also js is faster than python so that's at least one reason to use it
2015-08-18 22:17:52	nelsk	sauce?
2015-08-18 22:18:00	jpleau	v8 is pretty fast
2015-08-18 22:18:01	nelsk	the new node engines?
2015-08-18 22:18:19	logiz	the chrome engines
2015-08-18 22:18:22	nelsk	yeah i know, but are we really talking appreciably more preformance?
2015-08-18 22:18:25	logiz	yes
2015-08-18 22:18:54	nelsk	well that's interesting, cpython?
2015-08-18 22:19:31	Netsca	C vs C++
2015-08-18 22:19:42	logiz	cpython yes
2015-08-18 22:19:46	logiz	I almost never talk about pypy
2015-08-18 22:20:10	logiz	node probably doesn't block on one cpu either though
2015-08-18 22:20:15	nelsk	I'm also arguing for js as being as viable as its runtime, it's a really interesting language with some symantics that aren't very prolific in your average code bootcamp these days
2015-08-18 22:20:29	nelsk	21:20 < logiz> node probably doesn't block on one cpu either though
2015-08-18 22:20:31	nelsk	that's big for us
2015-08-18 22:20:46	nelsk	reactor pattern through and through, it's great
2015-08-18 22:21:01	nelsk	course, you've got all sorts of stuff like twisted and gevent in python
2015-08-18 22:21:08	logiz	apparently node does track threads in one process
2015-08-18 22:21:10	logiz	bummer
2015-08-18 22:21:20	nelsk	(gevent being coop multitasking though)
2015-08-18 22:21:29	logiz	yeah there are ways around it
2015-08-18 22:21:33	logiz	GIL is just silly imo
2015-08-18 22:21:46	logiz	and by ways Imean there is exactly one way around it
2015-08-18 22:22:32	Netsca	yo mang c++ mang
2015-08-18 22:22:34	nelsk	I also just have a whitespace agnosticism bias as well :)
2015-08-18 22:22:36	jpleau	o damn git for windows 2.5.0 released

2015-08-18 22:25:21	jpleau	like, <10 fps less than on Windows, on Ultra settings
2015-08-18 22:25:49	jpleau	nelsk: for Knight? Origins runs very well on PC here
2015-08-18 22:25:49	nelsk	I'm saying even the windows port was so bad steam pulled it from sale. don't have much hope for linux after that
2015-08-18 22:26:00	logiz	rocket thing sounds fun, but since it's not linux won't play it

2015-08-18 22:28:20	nelsk	i'll go out on a limb and say maybe we shouldn't have recommended haskell for him
2015-08-18 22:28:36	nelsk	jpleau: loot? iron galaxy had like 8 guys on their C team working on it
2015-08-18 22:28:53	nelsk	ports are what they do
2015-08-18 22:30:01	jpleau	nelsk: im wondering because Origins runs perfectly. So why did they not hire the same company who did that one?
2015-08-18 22:30:11	jpleau	wait, that's the same one, oops
2015-08-18 22:30:22	nelsk	oh I'm sorry, I thought you were referring to EA origin vs steam haha

2015-08-18 22:31:35	nelsk	iron galaxy actually has a decent track record, they did KI for xbone
2015-08-18 22:31:45	nelsk	or at least the second season, which is highly regarded
2015-08-18 22:32:06	nelsk	I'm just geussing they threw some extra resources at the port contract
2015-08-18 22:32:12	jpleau	I'm hoping they fix those issues, because I had a blast in Arkham City, and right now, Origins, I'd like to play Knight
2015-08-18 22:32:24	nelsk	guys are probably pros too and just didn't have the time to do what they needed and new it, happens all the time in games

2015-08-18 22:42:37	jpleau	it was "safe", but still not far from a GREAT idea lol

2015-08-18 22:54:20	jpleau	modern c++ is nice

2015-08-18 22:54:28	jpleau	old c++ is just classes on top of C
2015-08-18 22:54:40	nelsk	jpleau: really depends who's writing it
2015-08-18 22:54:58	jpleau	if you're writing it as C++, and not C with classes, it's probably nice code
2015-08-18 22:55:03	logiz	I think if I sat down with somebody, like jpleau and spend a day with c++ I'd do much better than if I read bsoup's book
2015-08-18 22:55:11	logiz	cause that book is like what, 2k pages long?

2015-08-18 22:57:41	jpleau	They used c++0x and c++1y because they didn't know in what year they'd come hah

2015-08-18 22:58:36	jpleau	also it will have a network lib based on boost::asio and a filesystem lib based on boost::filesystem

2015-08-18 23:47:47	momoyome	do you have any computer language experience

2015-08-18 23:49:24	momoyome	"Hacking" as in "i'm a l33t haxx0r" or "I like to make things do things they're not supposed to"

2015-08-18 23:51:46	logiz	that's the only reason I know people use it at all though
2015-08-18 23:51:51	logiz	all the startups use it just for that
2015-08-18 23:51:54	logiz	and python for everything else
2015-08-18 23:52:06	nelsk	kid doesn't know what a loop is
2015-08-18 23:53:43	jrobeson	that's not hte only reason logiz ..
2015-08-18 23:53:56	jrobeson	it's also the compiled binaries and no shared library junk to get in the way
2015-08-18 23:53:58	logiz	it's pretty much the only reasons it's used in production, yes
2015-08-18 23:54:00	jrobeson	and the binaries come with the runtime
2015-08-18 23:54:17	jrobeson	those are the reasons it's used in production.. it's a single file thing that includes everything
2015-08-18 23:54:25	jrobeson	it'd be like if py2exe worked everywhere 
2015-08-18 23:54:29	jrobeson	or rather.. python freeze
2015-08-18 23:54:35	jrobeson	it wasn't that such a terrible way of building packages :(
2015-08-18 23:54:39	logiz	but that's not what python freeze is supposed to do
2015-08-18 23:54:53	jrobeson	i though it brought everything together in one file
2015-08-18 23:55:00	logiz	it creates a text of the requirements
2015-08-18 23:55:07	jrobeson	ah.. that's boring then
2015-08-18 23:55:11	logiz	yup
2015-08-18 23:55:14	jrobeson	it's more like pex or py2exe then
2015-08-18 23:55:21	logiz	if you ever see a requirements.txt in a python git that's from pip freeze
2015-08-18 23:55:30	jrobeson	err cxfreeze lol
2015-08-18 23:55:32	jrobeson	that's what i meant
2015-08-18 23:55:34	logiz	ah
2015-08-18 23:55:46	jrobeson	that's where go wins
2015-08-18 23:56:00	jrobeson	go wins with static binaries and go fmt 
2015-08-18 23:56:01	jrobeson	too
2015-08-18 23:56:12	jrobeson	it'd be like if python enforced pep8 
2015-08-18 23:56:20	jrobeson	well not quite
2015-08-18 23:56:30	jrobeson	but python should have python format 
2015-08-18 23:56:31	logiz	if python enforced pep8 I'd probably switch immediately
2015-08-18 23:56:37	logiz	it's like I want type hinting but i dont' want the enforced
2015-08-18 23:56:42	jrobeson	that's a different story
2015-08-18 23:56:55	jrobeson	one is about coding standards.. and one is changing a property of the whole naguage
2015-08-18 23:56:56	nelsk	a lot of pep is style no?
2015-08-18 23:57:02	jrobeson	it's almost all style
2015-08-18 23:57:05	logiz	yup
2015-08-18 23:57:20	logiz	but if pep8 broke programs because of pep 8 I'd never use it
2015-08-18 23:57:30	jrobeson	how would it ever break programs?
2015-08-18 23:57:36	logiz	if it was enforced?
2015-08-18 23:57:46	jrobeson	well it can't be enforced if it can't fix 
2015-08-18 23:57:51	nelsk	logiz: write other stuff that doesn't care :D
2015-08-18 23:57:56	logiz	heh
2015-08-18 23:58:06	jrobeson	if python didn't have pep8.. it'd be a lot less compelling
2015-08-18 23:58:24	jrobeson	i just wish it was part of python as "python format"

2015-08-18 23:58:47	logiz	I guess I don't understand
2015-08-18 23:59:25	jrobeson	the nice thing about go shipping with the fmt tool  in which you type "go fmt" is that it automatically fixes up your program
2015-08-18 23:59:30	jrobeson	to comply with standards
2015-08-18 23:59:45	jrobeson	a lot of people like that.. because it stops being arguing over coding standards
2015-08-18 23:59:56	jrobeson	because coding standard arguments are terrible
2015-08-19 00:00:12	nelsk	jrobeson: they are, but I have certain ones I like :(
2015-08-19 00:00:24	jrobeson	and that is the problem
2015-08-19 00:00:36	jrobeson	but.. you should buck up and adopt whatever standards that exist

2015-08-19 00:01:40	jrobeson	i always use 4 in php because it's part of psr-2
2015-08-19 00:01:54	jrobeson	but they matter in other places that people use
2015-08-19 00:02:08	logiz	they're changeable in every half decent editor
2015-08-19 00:02:10	jrobeson	this is part of my firefox usercontent.css for github
2015-08-19 00:02:14	jrobeson	of course they are changable
2015-08-19 00:02:19	jrobeson	what does that have to do with anything
2015-08-19 00:02:24	nelsk	logiz: half the people i encounter don't know the difference
2015-08-19 00:02:26	jrobeson	plus not every file is viewed in an editor
2015-08-19 00:02:28	nelsk	or are lazy enough to not care
2015-08-19 00:02:32	logiz	nelsk: that's why I have :set list
2015-08-19 00:02:35	logiz	:)
2015-08-19 00:02:41	nelsk	and then have fun fixing their shit in git commits!
2015-08-19 00:02:52	nelsk	what about iOS repos?
2015-08-19 00:03:04	logiz	I have no idea what an ios repo is
2015-08-19 00:03:24	nelsk	wish I didn't, but now I have to because my job said I need to care
2015-08-19 00:03:40	nelsk	and now I need to work with contractors who don't give a fuuuck
2015-08-19 00:03:50	logiz	lol
2015-08-19 00:04:00	jrobeson	this is in my userContent.css
2015-08-19 00:04:01	jrobeson	pre {
2015-08-19 00:04:01	jrobeson	    tab-size: 4;
2015-08-19 00:04:01	jrobeson	    -moz-tab-size: 4;
2015-08-19 00:04:01	jrobeson	}
2015-08-19 00:04:05	logiz	either way, style guides are up to projects, and for my projects I don't care if they are pep8 or not
2015-08-19 00:04:12	nelsk	and have to deal with merging their garbage into my dev branches with absolutely zero care for it
2015-08-19 00:04:29	logiz	sounds like fun

2015-08-20 01:01:50	logiz	I'm saying that because f24 is supposed to be wayland
2015-08-20 01:01:54	logiz	but with gnome
2015-08-20 01:02:07	logiz	I gain zero benefits from using gnome
2015-08-20 01:02:26	logiz	wayland is going to piss me off for a long time while I have to rething everything I've ever done with X
2015-08-20 01:02:41	logiz	same way systemd pissed me off for a long time after I spent days learning a different init system
2015-08-20 01:03:06	logiz	linux is just always about learning new things, because things die
2015-08-20 01:03:11	jrobeson	evolution
2015-08-20 01:03:17	jrobeson	yes.. it's definitely evolutionary
2015-08-20 01:03:21	logiz	I wouldn't call that evolution
2015-08-20 01:03:33	logiz	progression is a better term
2015-08-20 01:03:39	jrobeson	evolution is always patterned with extinction events :)
2015-08-20 01:03:59	jrobeson	you won't have to use gnome to use wayland
2015-08-20 01:04:08	jrobeson	that's just all their guaranteeing support for 
2015-08-20 01:04:18	jrobeson	who knows if nvidia will even have their act together in time.. 
2015-08-20 01:04:20	logiz	and I have no support for anything else yet
2015-08-20 01:04:26	jrobeson	so plenty of people will still be using X
2015-08-20 01:04:43	logiz	idk, does nvidia driver matter? cause the free ones I assume will work
2015-08-20 01:05:05	jrobeson	it matters in that fedora will still support X for a long time because of stuff like nvidia :)
2015-08-20 01:05:07	jrobeson	and old programs
2015-08-20 01:05:15	logiz	I don't have a time frame, but until I can get a decent python based tiling manager, there is really no reason for me to switch to wayland
2015-08-20 01:05:50	logiz	idk maybe awesome has made progress
2015-08-20 01:05:54	logiz	I assume there are python bindings for it
2015-08-20 01:06:34	logiz	apparently awesome had some library somebody wrote 4 years ago lol

2015-08-20 01:07:10	jrobeson	not yet
2015-08-20 01:07:17	logiz	I'm not saying I have to
2015-08-20 01:07:22	jrobeson	when that one program does work.. then you can switch. until then don't
2015-08-20 01:07:25	jrobeson	otherwise.. stop whining
2015-08-20 01:07:30	logiz	I'm not whining
2015-08-20 01:07:34	jrobeson	linux isn't the game for you son
2015-08-20 01:07:36	logiz	it's a legitimate concern
2015-08-20 01:07:46	jrobeson	how?
2015-08-20 01:08:02	logiz	okay, so switch to systemd, that was a legitmate concern
2015-08-20 01:08:15	logiz	it's the same thing, whenever you switch systems the you join r/linux andpeople will tell you "just use it"
2015-08-20 01:08:29	jrobeson	it's a legitimate concern like 5 years from now.. when you might be forced to use wayland
2015-08-20 01:08:40	jrobeson	plenty of time for window managers to get their act together
2015-08-20 01:08:42	jrobeson	it's not now though
2015-08-20 01:08:53	logiz	it's a legitimate concern a year from now imo
2015-08-20 01:08:57	jrobeson	how?
2015-08-20 01:09:03	logiz	because it will be available?
2015-08-20 01:09:07	jrobeson	so freakin what?
2015-08-20 01:09:10	jrobeson	what does that matter?
2015-08-20 01:09:12	jrobeson	it's available now?
2015-08-20 01:09:20	logiz	not nearly as much as next year
2015-08-20 01:09:25	jrobeson	so what?
2015-08-20 01:09:35	logiz	so, I guess we shouldn't be concerned about python 3.5 then
2015-08-20 01:09:48	logiz	too new, might as well stick with 2.7 it works and most distros default it
2015-08-20 01:11:42	jrobeson	...
2015-08-20 01:11:57	jrobeson	you're still continuing to use python 2.7 anyways
2015-08-20 01:12:02	jrobeson	so that seems just as relevant
2015-08-20 01:12:04	logiz	that's not necessarily true
2015-08-20 01:12:09	logiz	I also use python 3
2015-08-20 01:12:15	jrobeson	yeah.. and nothing is breaking with 2.7
2015-08-20 01:12:17	jrobeson	so what?
2015-08-20 01:12:25	logiz	nnoremap <leader>py :!python3 % <CR>
2015-08-20 01:12:29	jrobeson	are you worried that you're going to make ap rogram that should require wayland but doesn't?
2015-08-20 01:12:38	logiz	no I'm not worried
2015-08-20 01:12:41	jrobeson	atm.. you're just spouting  non specifics
2015-08-20 01:12:53	logiz	no, I'm just stating that it wouldn't be worth it to use gnome for wayland
2015-08-20 01:12:58	jrobeson	except being annoyed at people telling you to use wayland
2015-08-20 01:13:05	jrobeson	which .. who the fuck cares
2015-08-20 01:13:13	logiz	it's just talking dude
2015-08-20 01:13:22	jrobeson	you already said that.. and that's fine 
2015-08-20 01:13:30	jrobeson	we all know you're not going to use GNOME
2015-08-20 01:13:44	logiz	and I didn't realize how much gnome was ready?
2015-08-20 01:13:47	logiz	until about 5 minutes ago
2015-08-20 01:13:47	jrobeson	i was asking about the other stuff you were saying.. not trying to force you to use gnome
2015-08-20 01:13:57	logiz	I know you're not trying to force me to use gnome
2015-08-20 01:14:08	jrobeson	i just wanted you to explain yourself as to what legimate concern you had
2015-08-20 01:14:10	logiz	but you also know that since I have rolling, it's not like I'm one to put off new stuff
2015-08-20 01:14:25	logiz	5 years from now is a _really_ long time for me
2015-08-20 01:14:29	jrobeson	yes it is 
2015-08-20 01:14:36	jrobeson	thus I'm failing to see the legitimate concern :)
2015-08-20 01:14:47	logiz	because I'm likely to wind up using wayland in some capacity
2015-08-20 01:14:55	jrobeson	once you have a window manager that supports it
2015-08-20 01:14:55	logiz	and it will suck if I do ditch i3 since I have spent a lot of time in it
2015-08-20 01:14:58	jrobeson	until then.. you won't be
2015-08-20 01:14:58	logiz	writing plugins and stuff
2015-08-20 01:15:07	jrobeson	it's likely that i3 will be ported.. 
2015-08-20 01:15:10	jrobeson	by then
2015-08-20 01:15:22	logiz	I'm not convinced it will be, figuring there has been 0 progress or interest in it
2015-08-20 01:15:23	jrobeson	you won't have to switch unless something is actually better in some other aspect
2015-08-20 01:15:35	jrobeson	that's because it hasn't felt like it was actually happening
2015-08-20 01:15:44	logiz	either way
2015-08-20 01:15:47	jrobeson	it'll be like freakin ipv6
2015-08-20 01:15:50	logiz	I've looked into being an early adapter of wayland before
2015-08-20 01:15:52	logiz	writing my own port
2015-08-20 01:16:00	logiz	it's annoying to look over the protocol
2015-08-20 01:16:01	jrobeson	you should work on the port that we were showing you :)
2015-08-20 01:16:02	logiz	I don't understand it
2015-08-20 01:16:08	jrobeson	well i bet some people would help you
2015-08-20 01:16:16	logiz	I literally don't even know where I'd start
2015-08-20 01:16:24	jrobeson	probably by examining weston
2015-08-20 01:16:28	logiz	I did
2015-08-20 01:16:29	jrobeson	that'd be the place to start
2015-08-20 01:16:31	logiz	didn't understand it :P
2015-08-20 01:16:33	jrobeson	oh.. libweston
2015-08-20 01:16:39	jrobeson	or whatever it's called
2015-08-20 01:16:57	jrobeson	well..  there will be tons more docco in the near future.. i can nearly gaurantee it
2015-08-20 01:16:57	logiz	it's pretty complex, and I feel either I"m not ready to tackle it, or I don't have the time to tackle it
2015-08-20 01:17:11	logiz	maybe I shoudl start writing a talk on it
2015-08-20 01:17:14	jrobeson	i can definitely see that you won't have time.. since it's not exactly in the things that define what you normally do 
2015-08-20 01:17:16	logiz	then I can still be an early adapter in the scene!
2015-08-20 01:17:17	jrobeson	i know I won't
2015-08-20 01:17:33	jrobeson	so.. what? this is all about wanting to get into the new hotness, but you can't? :)
2015-08-20 01:17:50	jrobeson	i can understand that sentiment
2015-08-20 01:17:52	logiz	I'd love for it to define what I do, but unfortunately I don't think it's very marketable for me to spend the next 6 months learning how wayland works and writing a bunch of shitty test apps to finally write a shitty thing that kind of works
2015-08-20 01:18:02	logiz	only to have documentation come out in 6 months that renders all my shitty research worthless!
2015-08-20 01:18:09	logiz	that's the worst, honestly
2015-08-20 01:18:15	jrobeson	so waiting seems to be the best strategy :)
2015-08-20 01:18:25	jrobeson	that's been my entire life in computers
2015-08-20 01:18:28	jrobeson	what you just said there
2015-08-20 01:18:33	logiz	and it sucks
2015-08-20 01:18:38	logiz	really makes you feel small
2015-08-20 01:18:55	jrobeson	i still think you're great logiz 
2015-08-20 01:18:59	logiz	<3
2015-08-20 01:19:15	logiz	I got it in my head that I'll never be a super smart genius, but even dedication and hardwork doesn't fix man hours
2015-08-20 01:19:22	logiz	hell even programming works like that
2015-08-20 01:19:25	logiz	I learned vb.net
2015-08-20 01:19:26	jrobeson	super smart geniuses are overrated 
2015-08-20 01:19:28	logiz	completely usless to me
2015-08-20 01:19:48	logiz	that's one of the reasons I'm tied to python, cause I can do stuff
2015-08-20 01:20:07	logiz	it's not my dream language, or what I see myself dying knowing, but for now at least I don't feel like a complete wanker
2015-08-20 01:20:23	jrobeson	btw.. twitter helps me with that :)
2015-08-20 01:20:38	jrobeson	when i see people who are like OMG.. i don't know how they do X, Y, and Z.. and it's so beyond me 
2015-08-20 01:20:40	logiz	I've been considering creating a twitter very much
2015-08-20 01:20:55	jrobeson	and they are the people who have huge int hte community
2015-08-20 01:21:02	logiz	yeah
2015-08-20 01:21:05	jrobeson	shows you that most people have trouble with computers.. even them
2015-08-20 01:21:08	jrobeson	same troubles
2015-08-20 01:21:20	logiz	rue
2015-08-20 01:21:22	logiz	true
2015-08-20 01:21:29	logiz	btw, did you actually find my video?
2015-08-20 01:21:36	jrobeson	no.. i didn't go that far
2015-08-20 01:21:48	logiz	I figured you did
2015-08-20 01:21:59	jrobeson	i just wanted to know what the conference was about
2015-08-20 01:22:08	jrobeson	and what other people were talking aobut
2015-08-20 01:22:41	jrobeson	probably one of the biggest city based conferences.. cuz NYC
2015-08-20 01:22:47	logiz	heh
2015-08-20 01:22:56	logiz	it was kind of small actually
2015-08-20 01:22:59	logiz	just over 300 people
2015-08-20 01:23:03	logiz	I thought that was small...
2015-08-20 01:23:11	jrobeson	ah.. i am surprised
2015-08-20 01:23:13	logiz	apparently the conference space is where the limits come from
2015-08-20 01:23:37	jrobeson	knowing python is still a great skill as a linux person
2015-08-20 01:23:42	logiz	yeah
2015-08-20 01:23:43	jrobeson	cuz python is the new perl
2015-08-20 01:23:47	logiz	yup
2015-08-20 01:23:54	logiz	except I was trying to figure out python -c stuff today
2015-08-20 01:23:56	logiz	it's annoying
2015-08-20 01:24:06	logiz	I thought you could delimit everything with a ';' but you can't
2015-08-20 01:24:11	logiz	still gotta whitespace new lines and stuff
2015-08-20 01:24:34	logiz	but linux is pretty forgiving in many ways, it's easy to install anything that was in any langauge and it just works
2015-08-20 01:24:37	jrobeson	that seems weird yeah
2015-08-20 01:24:54	jrobeson	python is good for the programs.. but not good for scripting them.. and doing one off stuff
2015-08-20 01:24:59	jrobeson	because you do have to think about that
2015-08-20 01:25:28	logiz	here's a good example
2015-08-20 01:25:29	jrobeson	nelsk, hey hey.. tell us about your rusting
2015-08-20 01:25:36	logiz	watching bjarne stroustrups video
2015-08-20 01:25:50	jrobeson	C++ magick
2015-08-20 01:25:55	logiz	"in 1987 I thought I was going to the last OOP conference because once everybody accepted it, there'd be no more to talk about"
2015-08-20 01:26:00	jrobeson	lol
2015-08-20 01:26:01	logiz	2015, still trying to talk about it
2015-08-20 01:26:15	logiz	I think it happens a lot with professors to
2015-08-20 01:26:17	jrobeson	we're still talking about 1950s programming languages
2015-08-20 01:26:27	jrobeson	and paradigms
2015-08-20 01:26:29	logiz	they think they'll put out research and move on, but that winds up defining their dentire careers
2015-08-20 01:26:40	logiz	there was a talk about python being like fortran
2015-08-20 01:26:42	logiz	didn't see it though
2015-08-20 01:26:44	logiz	specifically with **
2015-08-20 01:26:48	logiz	somebody was like "kwargs?"
2015-08-20 01:27:00	jrobeson	prounding it like that is funny
2015-08-20 01:27:01	logiz	and I was like "eh, probably exponentation, since it's mathematical operators we're probably talking about"
2015-08-20 01:27:14	jrobeson	pronouncing*
2015-08-20 01:27:18	logiz	yeah lol
2015-08-20 01:27:28	logiz	actually they said args, but I assumed they meant kwargs
2015-08-20 01:27:52	logiz	also one talk somebody said "does anybody here know anything about bitshifting or ever used it in python?"
2015-08-20 01:27:57	logiz	I was one of the only people to raise my hand!
2015-08-20 01:28:06	jrobeson	nerd
2015-08-20 01:28:20	logiz	every comp sci person does bitshifts and multiplication and stuff
2015-08-20 01:28:27	logiz	I did that back in, gosh, 2007 I think
2015-08-20 01:28:31	jrobeson	lol
2015-08-20 01:28:55	logiz	going back to school was one of the best decisions I made, not studying comp sci for my degree was one of the worst
2015-08-20 01:29:36	logiz	kind of feels bad, like I'm starting my career too late now
2015-08-20 01:29:36	jrobeson	you certainly have a head for it
2015-08-20 01:29:38	jrobeson	more than i do
2015-08-20 01:30:16	jrobeson	depends on what your goal is i suppose
2015-08-20 01:30:30	logiz	well I think by this time next week, either I'm forcing my way into this company
2015-08-20 01:30:35	jrobeson	doing cool (and actually useful) shit still gets you rewarded 
2015-08-20 01:30:39	jrobeson	no matter how old you are
2015-08-20 01:30:42	logiz	like I'm not joking, I'm going full out getting this job, pretty much demanding it
2015-08-20 01:30:45	logiz	and if not I'm starting my own company
2015-08-20 01:30:56	jrobeson	i was just about to suggest that you do something like that
2015-08-20 01:31:08	jrobeson	i think it would do you well to get some practical experience 
2015-08-20 01:31:40	logiz	yeah, I'd spend about 5 bucks buildign the prototype (just software and cell phone stuff), do a little bit of sql and routing, and then sell to small offices
2015-08-20 01:31:49	logiz	probably for some super undervalued price
2015-08-20 01:32:07	jrobeson	go sass... keep makin that money
2015-08-20 01:32:12	jrobeson	err saas
2015-08-20 01:32:23	logiz	that's pretty much the point
2015-08-20 01:32:51	jrobeson	logiz, you should take a look at the thread on fedora-devel now about rawhide and changing it up so it's more useful
2015-08-20 01:33:04	jrobeson	honestly.. you should just subscribe toe fedora-devel
2015-08-20 01:33:10	logiz	I should
2015-08-20 01:33:18	logiz	I don't feel like putting my email in an email list though

2015-08-20 10:42:41	logiz	if you're not signed up for academic journals they cost a lot of money, sometimes you can buy an individual issue for like 25 bucks, sometimes more, sometimes you can't
2015-08-20 10:43:52	fluxus	I'll keep it in mind
2015-08-20 10:44:04	logiz	or you can just get that googledrive link
2015-08-20 10:44:13	fluxus	decided to focus on getting CISSP at the moment
2015-08-20 10:44:17	logiz	no you didn't
2015-08-20 10:44:26	logiz	you decided to download that book at get 775 pages in
2015-08-20 10:44:47	logiz	see the good thing about popular academic journals, is that some college professor always puts them up as a pdf somewhere :P
2015-08-20 10:44:50	fluxus	I saved it. I can't read shit like that on a computer though
2015-08-20 10:45:05	logiz	then find a college that has unlimited printing :D
2015-08-20 10:45:18	logiz	though usually they do 500 pages a semester + 1$ for another 500
2015-08-20 10:45:24	fluxus	and carry around 50 pages of loose shit?

2015-08-21 00:16:32	slycurgus	best case you get jerb and have moneys

2015-08-21 00:17:32	logiz	slycurgus: I've thought about more ways to convolute fizzbuzz
2015-08-21 00:17:40	logiz	I'm still waiting for somebody to ask me to actually do fizzbuzz
2015-08-21 00:18:00	logiz	I think I got a 40 line one somewhere of absolute "hey look I can build class factories just to make an iterator for fizzbuzz"
2015-08-21 00:18:22	logiz	"lol fizzbuzz is actually just a tree with a node pointing to the value you want"
2015-08-21 00:18:25	slycurgus	the only place i've been asked to do fizzbuzz is codecademy :P but then i'm not a programmer so that might be 90% of the reason
2015-08-21 00:18:36	logiz	heh
2015-08-21 00:18:43	logiz	I'm not a programmer either
2015-08-21 00:18:45	logiz	i'm just a dreamer
2015-08-21 00:18:55	slycurgus	someone called me a programmer recently
2015-08-21 00:18:55	logiz	except I'm pissing off jrobeson with my magic methods now
2015-08-21 00:18:57	slycurgus	i was flattered
2015-08-21 00:19:08	*	logiz entices jrobeson with __len__ and __getitem__ to build sequences
2015-08-21 00:19:22	steev	YASSSS
2015-08-21 00:19:22	slycurgus	also it was probably inaccurate because the mighty feat i had performed was a 50-line php script
2015-08-21 00:19:22	logiz	slycurgus: you're a damn sexy programmer too
2015-08-21 00:19:25	steev	i has an oberon
2015-08-21 00:19:27	slycurgus	;)
2015-08-21 00:19:43	logiz	50 line php isn't programming it's more like bdsm
2015-08-21 00:19:50	slycurgus	lol
2015-08-21 00:20:00	steev	so many python scripters at rackspace call themselves programmers :(
2015-08-21 00:20:05	logiz	sometimes you drip hot candlewax on parts you regret, and that's php in a nutshell
2015-08-21 00:20:09	*	logiz publishes o'reilley book
2015-08-21 00:20:10	slycurgus	you'll be pleased to hear then that i spent bits and pieces of yesterday turning it into a 150-line php script
2015-08-21 00:20:17	logiz	steev: ty
2015-08-21 00:20:24	steev	for what
2015-08-21 00:20:33	logiz	steev: because I argue with python people everyday abou tthat
2015-08-21 00:20:39	logiz	I'm like, lol you're not a programmer you're just a scripter
2015-08-21 00:20:46	logiz	NO PYTHON IS A REAL LANGUAGE CAUSE I CAN OOP
2015-08-21 00:20:48	slycurgus	favourite part - realising that vim appends a line feed to the end of the file and that's what was fucking everything up
2015-08-21 00:20:50	steev	"but python can be compiled!"
2015-08-21 00:20:56	logiz	yeah, go fuck yourself, let me know when you'redoing bit shifts on memory
2015-08-21 00:21:10	slycurgus	spent half an hour printing a string and the comparison to it and being mystified why they didn't match
2015-08-21 00:21:15	slycurgus	>_>
2015-08-21 00:21:20	logiz	slycurgus: yeah that's a linux thing, not a vim thing though
2015-08-21 00:21:31	logiz	I think mac uses \r
2015-08-21 00:21:37	logiz	windows is \r\n or something
2015-08-21 00:21:37	slycurgus	apparently it's a setting for vim, though - :set noeol
2015-08-21 00:21:43	logiz	til
2015-08-21 00:21:55	slycurgus	it was appending to the end of the file, not the line
2015-08-21 00:22:15	slycurgus	(the file was only one line so functionally the same, but that's the setting apparently)
2015-08-21 00:22:32	logiz	yeah I see
2015-08-21 00:22:36	logiz	literally an EOL line
2015-08-21 00:23:05	slycurgus	i checked the file in vim, 3 characters y-e-s
2015-08-21 00:23:14	slycurgus	checked it with xxd, 4 characters
2015-08-21 00:25:45	logiz	heh
2015-08-21 00:25:51	logiz	!xxd %

2015-08-21 00:26:02	logiz	clammy go fuck yourself, that's a bang command for vim, not for your sassy ass
2015-08-21 00:26:02	clammy	logiz: what
2015-08-21 00:26:07	steev	exactly clammy
2015-08-21 00:26:18	logiz	steev: u so meen
2015-08-21 00:26:37	logiz	so steev are you from texas, because I was making fun of texans tonight
2015-08-21 00:26:38	steev	logiz: that's because i'm drinking oberon, and i'm a mean drunk
2015-08-21 00:26:46	steev	logiz: no :( i just live there
2015-08-21 00:26:51	logiz	ah good

2015-08-21 00:27:37	logiz	I was saying how texans don't speak english
2015-08-21 00:27:39	steev	i was the only white kid in class from age 12-16
2015-08-21 00:27:43	logiz	my buddy askes what they spoke, and I was like "texan"
2015-08-21 00:27:48	steev	true

2015-08-22 00:29:23	HappyMan	pick up girls from jersey city, tolerate their accent, buy them something nice at serendipity and be done with it
2015-08-22 00:29:34	logiz	the fact I can't buy a girl a coffee is a big delimiter that money == girls
2015-08-22 00:29:40	HappyMan	oh you're that broke

2015-08-22 00:30:33	logiz	and make that
2015-08-22 00:30:53	logiz	first I gotta learn a framework, a language, and minimal game programming

2015-08-22 00:31:18	logiz	there's a method to what I do everyday
2015-08-22 00:31:35	logiz	50% of the time I try to learn more, 50% of the time I try to work on projects that are going towards career goals
2015-08-22 00:31:48	logiz	most of the time I try to coincide that with my interests
2015-08-22 00:31:54	clammy	it's... I don't know your sudo password in... but then I'll have a not so impressed anymore especially when my coworkers are capable of carrying boxes up the word about snacklinux to bedrock
2015-08-22 00:31:57	logiz	but I"d probably be learning lisp or haskell if I was just a bumfuck doing nothing
2015-08-22 00:32:22	logiz	I'm about to beg a job to give me 20k just to work for them
2015-08-22 00:32:32	logiz	then they won't hire me cause that means I"m worthless, when really I just need money
2015-08-22 00:32:44	logiz	I'd rather get paid less than a burger flipper just to have a job that doesn't completely suck

2015-08-22 00:33:51	logiz	in this channel and everywhere else
2015-08-22 00:34:13	logiz	I'm also starting to seriously think I"m dumb
2015-08-22 00:34:22	HappyMan	i think you give off bad vibes because you're so down on yourself
2015-08-22 00:34:24	logiz	but hey, I have some pretty cool fibonacci iterators
2015-08-22 00:34:35	logiz	I'm not down on myself when looking for jobs
2015-08-22 00:34:46	logiz	I'm a bit humble sometimes, and a bit over the top other times
2015-08-22 00:34:51	logiz	trying to find whichever method works
2015-08-22 00:34:59	logiz	sometimes I brand myself full stack just because fuck am I going to lose
2015-08-22 00:35:04	logiz	not liek I"m going to get the job anyway
2015-08-22 00:35:13	logiz	or like the times I pretended to be a datascientist
2015-08-22 00:35:36	HappyMan	are you getting interviews based off your resume?
2015-08-22 00:35:39	logiz	no
2015-08-22 00:35:46	logiz	my resume is pretty fucking good too
2015-08-22 00:35:58	logiz	I list like 7 decently advanced python projects that are all publically available
2015-08-22 00:36:13	logiz	I guess decently advanced really means intermediate level
2015-08-22 00:36:19	logiz	it's pretty clear that I'm not a beginner
2015-08-22 00:36:34	HappyMan	you have a masters right? but not very much previous work experience/
2015-08-22 00:36:35	HappyMan	?

2015-08-22 00:37:03	logiz	well
2015-08-22 00:37:04	HappyMan	what about your thesis
2015-08-22 00:37:14	logiz	I didn't write a thesis, hence "almost masters"
2015-08-22 00:37:17	jrobeson	i just wanna talk to these friends of yours who aren't helping you get a job.. as to why they aren't
2015-08-22 00:37:35	logiz	jrobeson: well one doesn't like my attiude that I'd learn django to get a job at his company
2015-08-22 00:37:46	HappyMan	explain further
2015-08-22 00:37:48	logiz	becuase "it's not my passion in life" or some bullshit when I said "yeah I"ll do django for a job"
2015-08-22 00:38:03	HappyMan	why are you calling this pretentious fuck a friend
2015-08-22 00:38:25	logiz	cause you know these people, these are the super awkard people you know that hang around programming
2015-08-22 00:38:28	jrobeson	i wouldn't say that it's pretentious.. unless it's his company
2015-08-22 00:38:30	logiz	I"m a better programmer than him btw
2015-08-22 00:39:01	HappyMan	jrobeson: no that's pretty pretentious, to assume that only the people who are aroused by a technology should be the ones working with it
2015-08-22 00:39:10	jrobeson	if it's his company.. then it is .. if he just works there.. it's probably just so he doesn't get saddled with someone he doesn't wanna train/keep motiivated
2015-08-22 00:39:20	logiz	he just contracted to hire after internship
2015-08-22 00:39:22	logiz	lol

2015-08-22 00:39:38	logiz	he was telling me that they're currently writing an stmp server or some shit in python

2015-08-22 00:39:49	logiz	I've been told I"m not smart enough for an internship by fucking internship companies

2015-08-22 00:47:08	logiz	"I can't say hi, or bye, or thanks, or go fuck yourself"

2015-08-27 17:55:43	Netsca	What make a profile legit
2015-08-27 17:55:47	+logiz	not a bot?
2015-08-27 17:56:01	+logiz	some people have multiple profiles, some have ones just for apis (which you're not suppoesd to have)

2015-08-27 18:08:09	HappyMan	no, because testing freezes every now and again
2015-08-27 18:08:17	HappyMan	so you can't rely on debian testing upstream to keep supplyng you with packages
2015-08-27 18:09:41	+logiz	just use fedora

2015-08-27 18:12:38	+logiz	well if you want rolling
2015-08-27 18:12:41	+logiz	you could always go arch
2015-08-27 18:13:03	Netsca	Doesn't stuff break in arch sometimes
2015-08-27 18:13:09	clammy	when they asked to turn me off

2015-08-27 18:14:15	+logiz	but things don't break all that much
2015-08-27 18:15:13	Netsca	I'd prefer fedora to arch just on the fence about switching

2015-08-27 18:26:08	icarusdekoe	you have to install the codecs yourself. nonfree firmware isnt on any distro by default
2015-08-27 18:27:03	icarusdekoe	same with mp3 codecs. they arent actually installed by "default" on any distro
2015-08-27 18:27:18	icarusdekoe	closest is ubuntu which has an opt in as part of the installer
2015-08-27 18:28:10	slycurgus	icarusdekoe: Solus includes mp3 by default
2015-08-27 18:28:25	Netsca	How do you install mp3 codecs and nonfree firmware in fedora?
2015-08-27 18:28:31	clammy	gparted is for dev work
2015-08-27 18:28:46	jrobeson	hah
2015-08-27 18:28:51	jrobeson	Netsca, rpmfusion
2015-08-27 18:28:56	icarusdekoe	dnf install gstreamer-manythings
2015-08-27 18:29:05	icarusdekoe	and linux-firmware-nonfree i would assume
2015-08-27 18:29:10	jrobeson	add the rpmfusion repo and then just install it like icarusdekoe said
2015-08-27 18:29:31	Netsca	just asking cause im coming from debian
2015-08-27 18:29:33	jrobeson	icarusdekoe, you have to tell poeple where to get it :) haha
2015-08-27 18:29:50	icarusdekoe	jrobeson: sorry i forgot/wasnt aware that rpmfusion was required
2015-08-27 18:30:03	jrobeson	it's nonfree, so you do have to add the repo
2015-08-27 18:30:15	icarusdekoe	that or i just assume anyone running fedora will have to add rpmfusion anyways... 
2015-08-27 18:30:48	+logiz	icarusdekoe: specifically I give it a glob sudo yum install gstreamer*
2015-08-27 18:30:52	+logiz	but I don't think you can glob dnf?
2015-08-27 18:30:56	jrobeson	if it weren't for the codecs.. I'd totally ignore rpmfusion :(
2015-08-27 18:31:10	jrobeson	you can still glob dnf.. at least for list
2015-08-27 18:31:18	jrobeson	I wouldn't recommend globbing gstreamer though
2015-08-27 18:31:18	icarusdekoe	slycurgus: i feel like thats violating certain licenses...
2015-08-27 18:31:28	+logiz	it is
2015-08-27 18:31:33	jrobeson	you'll end up with a bunch of packages you don't need
2015-08-27 18:31:34	+logiz	same way you can't play dvds
2015-08-27 18:31:46	jrobeson	like devel packages and maybe codecs you don't need
2015-08-27 18:31:55	Netsca	Can you play dvds on fedora?
2015-08-27 18:31:58	slycurgus	icarusdekoe: maybe so
2015-08-27 18:32:02	+logiz	oh nvm I meant gstreamer[1,2]-plugins
2015-08-27 18:32:03	jrobeson	same as on debian.. add the packages you need
2015-08-27 18:32:08	Netsca	Oh ok
2015-08-27 18:32:08	+logiz	and glob the plugins
2015-08-27 18:32:21	jrobeson	there is no 2
2015-08-27 18:32:26	+logiz	I thought there was
2015-08-27 18:32:27	jrobeson	it's gstreamer or gstreamer1 
2015-08-27 18:32:35	icarusdekoe	slycurgus: because thats why they cant be included by default in ubuntu/debian etc.
2015-08-27 18:32:37	+logiz	either way you need good, bad, ugly,
2015-08-27 18:32:44	icarusdekoe	the license restricts the redistribution
2015-08-27 18:32:45	jrobeson	you definitely want gstreamer1.. but some old stuff still requires gstreamer
2015-08-27 18:32:52	slycurgus	actually, looking again at the solus article all they say is 'includes codecs by default' so maybe mp3 isnt covered by that
2015-08-27 18:32:55	jrobeson	I don't recmmed installing it
2015-08-27 18:32:56	icarusdekoe	logiz: dont forget hideous
2015-08-27 18:32:59	Netsca	I've heard about this thing called fedy what is it

2015-08-27 18:33:40	+logiz	it's so annoying
2015-08-27 18:33:40	jrobeson	I don't use fedy at all
2015-08-27 18:33:44	icarusdekoe	basically gstreamer-* ...
2015-08-27 18:33:48	jrobeson	no
2015-08-27 18:33:49	clammy	that's a little more of a binary tree?
2015-08-27 18:33:53	jrobeson	gstreamer1-plugins-*
2015-08-27 18:34:04	icarusdekoe	i have no clue whats included in what 
2015-08-27 18:34:16	icarusdekoe	im assuming good = ogg etc
2015-08-27 18:34:22	jrobeson	the actual plugins for codecs, and thus the codecs
2015-08-27 18:34:34	icarusdekoe	ugly is mp3 h264 i think
2015-08-27 18:34:36	jrobeson	gstreamer-* will pull in gstreamer and gstreamer1
2015-08-27 18:34:40	icarusdekoe	i dont know what bad is...
2015-08-27 18:34:42	jrobeson	err
2015-08-27 18:34:43	Netsca	So do I download fedora server for netinstall?
2015-08-27 18:34:50	jrobeson	will only pull in gstreamer 0.10
2015-08-27 18:35:04	jrobeson	gstreamer1-* will pull in the codecs and all devel packages and junk
2015-08-27 18:35:42	jrobeson	so you just want gstreamer1-plugins-*  and maybe gstreamer-plugins-* .. but only install gstreamer-plugins-* if you actually require gstreamer 0.10 stuff.. like the current default for downloaded firefox (not packaged)
2015-08-27 18:36:15	jrobeson	also pidgin requires gstreamer 
2015-08-27 18:36:15	icarusdekoe	fuck it, sudo dnf install *
2015-08-27 18:36:18	jrobeson	lol
2015-08-27 18:36:28	jrobeson	Netsca, why would you install fedora server?
2015-08-27 18:36:32	Netsca	Or can i use the workstation netinstall are they different?
2015-08-27 18:36:36	icarusdekoe	jrobeson: to avoid the gnomes
2015-08-27 18:36:39	jrobeson	the base package install is different
2015-08-27 18:36:45	jrobeson	use the nonproduct version 
2015-08-27 18:36:48	jrobeson	that's what you want
2015-08-27 18:36:51	Netsca	I forgot workstation had a netinstall
2015-08-27 18:37:10	jrobeson	the server default also sets up different firewall settings and other things.. so I don't recommend it for a default 
2015-08-27 18:37:22	jrobeson	or rather for a choice
2015-08-27 18:37:27	icarusdekoe	i prefer to download the full image, and butn it to 48 floppys
2015-08-27 18:37:40	icarusdekoe	it takes 3 days to install
2015-08-27 18:37:52	icarusdekoe	so it feels more like gentoo :)
2015-08-27 18:38:25	Netsca	Fedora uses .rpm right?

2015-08-27 18:47:06	+logiz	that's an actual use case...
2015-08-27 18:47:07	jrobeson	why would you echo it?

2015-08-27 18:48:02	jrobeson	it looks like yum itself is problematic 
2015-08-27 18:48:13	+logiz	the problem is the "*" specifically
2015-08-27 18:48:20	+logiz	it would happen with any stdout that puts that
2015-08-27 18:48:21	jrobeson	it shouldn't show that other yunk when outputting to a non interactive terminal
2015-08-27 18:48:33	icarusdekoe	what about echo "$(your stupid crap)"
2015-08-27 18:48:35	jrobeson	or in a subshell
2015-08-27 18:48:50	+logiz	that works icarusdekoe 
2015-08-27 18:48:58	+logiz	fucking hate quoting when I don't expect it

2015-08-27 18:49:16	icarusdekoe	thats just a bash general problem...
2015-08-27 18:49:19	+logiz	it is
2015-08-27 18:49:19	clammy	on the wrong key stored locally?
2015-08-27 18:49:23	+logiz	that's why I'm saying it's not a yum problem
2015-08-27 18:49:38	icarusdekoe	like doing for i in $(ls) if any files have spaces...
2015-08-27 18:49:42	+logiz	yup
2015-08-27 18:49:49	jrobeson	i'm super confused.. i thought we were talking about a dnf specific problem
2015-08-27 18:49:52	+logiz	which is funny cause the correct way to do that is to just echo *
2015-08-27 18:49:56	+logiz	or for i in *
2015-08-27 18:50:00	icarusdekoe	it goes 'herp durp bleech"
2015-08-27 18:50:03	jrobeson	and i see not much difference between the dnf output and the yum output
2015-08-27 18:50:28	+logiz	dnf doesn't seem to say "loading repositories" with a glob char for me
2015-08-27 18:50:30	icarusdekoe	logiz: that has the same problem as before i think...
2015-08-27 18:50:31	+logiz	that's the only difference
2015-08-27 18:50:37	+logiz	icarusdekoe: it totally does'nt
2015-08-27 18:50:59	+logiz	 ~~>for i in *;do echo $i; done
2015-08-27 18:51:05	+logiz	is just like using ls
2015-08-27 18:51:16	+logiz	so you can grab multiple file names with spaces
2015-08-27 18:51:19	jrobeson	i'm just trying to understand what dnf probelms you had
2015-08-27 18:51:21	icarusdekoe	oh no i remember the problem with that

Looking at a System Monitor the pacman process under my user acct keeps killing itself and then starting up again. As far as I can tell this is causing my massive CPU usage spikes (CPU is constantly between 10% and 100% on both cores) and slowing everything down as a result

2015-08-30 13:21:59	Cloud_Kicker	Good day r/linux . I was wondering, as an oldtimer who used to work on SuSe 4.0. with an XFCE shell, what would you recommend when I re-dive into linux
2015-08-30 13:22:55	Cloud_Kicker	Some of my friends have been talking about Ubuntu and how easy it is to ( re - ) learn... so I delved into it and found Xubuntu, it has an XFCE window manager
2015-08-30 13:24:04	Cloud_Kicker	I am running an i7-4790K and GTX 970 with 8 GB of RAM. Is there any reason to let it affect my choice ?
2015-08-30 13:31:31	indeedwatson	Cloud_Kicker: im not very experienced but i went from Lubuntu to Fedora and I'm liking it
2015-08-30 13:31:35	indeedwatson	not a fan of xfce tho
2015-08-30 13:32:14	steev	xfce is teh bomb diggity
2015-08-30 13:32:21	steev	it's like osx without the sexy
2015-08-30 13:33:11	indeedwatson	if i had to use a floating wm i'd probably go with xfce
2015-08-30 13:33:22	Cloud_Kicker	What is a floating WM ?
2015-08-30 13:33:26	steev	indeed watson, indeed
2015-08-30 13:33:57	indeedwatson	window manager that has windows floating around that you move/resize with the mouse
2015-08-30 13:34:06	Cloud_Kicker	Ahh
2015-08-30 13:34:57	Cloud_Kicker	Soo, I went and asked my friends what they would recomend me ( given the same information )
2015-08-30 13:35:21	Cloud_Kicker	And I think I instigated a social media war between them with Gnomve versus XFCE
2015-08-30 13:35:49	Cloud_Kicker	Soo... Should I roll a D20 to decide ?
2015-08-30 13:36:25	indeedwatson	Cloud_Kicker: just install them all
2015-08-30 13:36:38	indeedwatson	and i3 :^)
2015-08-30 13:37:07	Cloud_Kicker	That would mean that whatever distro does not make it on my SSD due to size constraints will be the loser XD
2015-08-30 13:37:26	indeedwatson	Cloud_Kicker: are you talking about distros or DE?
2015-08-30 13:37:56	Cloud_Kicker	I'm not sure at this point
2015-08-30 13:38:09	Cloud_Kicker	I know that Ubuntu ( regular ) uses gnome, and Xubuntu uses XFCE
2015-08-30 13:38:17	Cloud_Kicker	And I am trying to pick one
2015-08-30 13:38:22	indeedwatson	Cloud_Kicker: any distro uses and DE
2015-08-30 13:38:37	indeedwatson	you can install xfce in ubuntu

2015-08-30 13:42:28	indeedwatson	maybe there's another small difference but for the most part, no, there isn't, if you're already set on ubuntu

2015-08-30 19:30:59	+logiz	one of them is an organizer of python, she's, weird.  idk she seems nice enough but she doesn't really get involved with people
2015-08-30 19:31:14	+logiz	like some days she just seems completely pissed off at the world and doesn't respond when I say hi
2015-08-30 19:31:16	+logiz	lol
2015-08-30 19:31:46	ByteEnable	she loves you, she love you not.  Need a 4 leaf clover.
2015-08-30 19:31:47	+logiz	the other ones is actually lead senior python, and another one is another lead product manager or something
2015-08-30 19:32:26	+logiz	one of them, I tried getting into a conversation with, and I tried small talk, and I failed small talk, so it turned weird, and then I saw them at the conference and they gave a talk after me, so we were talking again and we had something in common at that point
2015-08-30 19:32:46	+logiz	they also just moved

2015-08-30 19:34:02	+logiz	couple of thousand pings a second

2015-08-30 19:34:20	+logiz	the startup I'm trying to get a job at gets over a million pings a second
2015-08-30 19:34:33	+logiz	and I like them because they gotta use real data structures and shit to solve that load
2015-08-30 19:34:41	jrobeson	are they white labeled?

2015-08-30 19:35:48	+logiz	I'm not saying they to t.co, but a lot of media publication shortners are run by bitly

2015-08-30 19:36:22	+logiz	their basic plan is what you see other people post, bit.ly/1234 and then companies buy stuff like redd.it/1254
2015-08-30 19:36:32	+logiz	the reasoning for bitly to handle and serve that is because of analytics
2015-08-30 19:36:45	+logiz	so when you see url shortners they're usually being sneaky
2015-08-30 19:38:10	+logiz	if this organizer didn't have her days I could probably just walk into the company and play ping pong, there are a few startups I'm confident I can just walk into and hang out
2015-08-30 19:38:42	+logiz	and I actually confirmed it yesterday with somebody, if they thought it'd be weird for me to walk into their startup and ask for a job (as an example of trying to get jobs)

2015-09-21 20:48:02	logiz	'.' is mute
2015-09-21 20:48:12	logiz	it's actually very convenient
2015-09-21 20:48:19	lainlives	i got vol keys, IE button is yakuake dropdown, calculator is krunner

2015-09-21 20:49:23	logiz	until I'm like "hit f5 to refresh"

2015-09-21 20:49:55	lainlives	and it dont re-enable until i reboot in linux
2015-09-21 20:49:59	logiz	I'd accidentally turn off wifi and not know it
2015-09-21 20:50:03	logiz	cause of stupid fucking mappings
2015-09-21 20:50:09	lainlives	the wifi driver segfaults and gets unloaded or something like that
2015-09-21 20:50:13	logiz	I miss the days where there was a physical switch for things
2015-09-21 20:50:33	logiz	lainlives: OMG
2015-09-21 20:50:44	logiz	I completely forgot that turning off wifi sometimes fucking crashed your drivers in windows
2015-09-21 20:50:52	lainlives	logiz: hmm, the particlefx library for qtquick uses your cpu's frequency for timing
2015-09-21 20:51:06	lainlives	logiz: yes, at least in windows when it happened it would BSOD
2015-09-21 20:51:06	logiz	cause qt isn't a real graphics library :P
2015-09-21 20:51:16	lainlives	in linux it would just stop and not tell you why
2015-09-21 20:51:18	lainlives	until you dmesg
2015-09-21 20:51:26	lainlives	the kernel would keep powering through
2015-09-21 20:51:32	logiz	yeah
2015-09-21 20:51:41	logiz	lainlives: do you actually care about particles?
2015-09-21 20:51:50	logiz	I might have a solution for you
2015-09-21 20:51:53	lainlives	though windows is 100x better at recovering from crashing gpu drivers
2015-09-21 20:51:56	logiz	but your'e going to have to use a 3rd party library
2015-09-21 20:52:04	lainlives	it reinits the hardware and reloads the driver as if its rebooting
2015-09-21 20:52:07	lainlives	and picks up where you left off
2015-09-21 20:52:15	lainlives	almost 100% success rate
2015-09-21 20:52:18	lainlives	since win7
2015-09-21 20:52:21	logiz	heh
2015-09-21 20:52:40	logiz	some kid was telling me how he was buying a thinkpad 200 or whatever to install linux on
2015-09-21 20:52:42	logiz	and I was like "have fun"
2015-09-21 20:52:47	lainlives	i mean, windows really is a solid OS, i just wish they could at least expose /some/ internals
2015-09-21 20:52:48	logiz	"no I'm not going to spend days helping you"
2015-09-21 20:52:55	lainlives	lol
2015-09-21 20:52:58	logiz	they do expose internals
2015-09-21 20:53:01	logiz	through abi calls
2015-09-21 20:53:06	lainlives	logiz: not the fun stuffs
2015-09-21 20:53:13	logiz	they actually do expose quite a bit of fun stuff
2015-09-21 20:53:17	logiz	not the _real_ fun stuff
2015-09-21 20:53:19	lainlives	logiz: like shell32.dll has to be fully mapped yourself
2015-09-21 20:53:27	logiz	who the fuck uses shell32 anymore
2015-09-21 20:53:36	logiz	(same people that use win32 cause it's better)
2015-09-21 20:53:52	lainlives	well win x64 still uses alot of 32 legacy naming
2015-09-21 20:54:01	logiz	lainlives: and if they exposed any more of the kernel, people would realize they completely bastardized bsd
2015-09-21 20:54:10	lainlives	logiz: i also had to do alot of explorer.exe and winlogon tweaks (like removing the artificial memory limit) and whatnot
2015-09-21 20:54:14	logiz	"oh windows is really a shitty copy of bsd? well fuck that
2015-09-21 20:54:27	lainlives	logiz: the kernel is actually qutie well reversed these days
2015-09-21 20:54:34	logiz	and is bsd!
2015-09-21 20:54:39	logiz	well small parts are
2015-09-21 20:54:45	lainlives	well why not
2015-09-21 20:54:45	logiz	it's bsd based
2015-09-21 20:54:54	logiz	it's just really shitty otherwise
2015-09-21 20:55:04	lainlives	logiz: the ps3 ps4 and vita run BSD
2015-09-21 20:55:06	logiz	haven't heard of win10 being reversed engineered
2015-09-21 20:55:11	logiz	I thought the best we had was xp
2015-09-21 20:55:12	lainlives	logiz: not probably
2015-09-21 20:55:17	lainlives	but the win7 kernel was quite known
2015-09-21 20:55:22	logiz	ps4 is not bsd I thought
2015-09-21 20:55:26	logiz	I thought they switched after ps3

2015-09-23 16:03:07	icarusdekoe	whoa
2015-09-23 16:03:10	sunshinex	that's the problem though - ulimit can show me things, and temporarily set them.  To persist the setting, I need to add to limits.conf and/or sysctl.conf
2015-09-23 16:03:11	icarusdekoe	you can count to 10?
2015-09-23 16:03:22	sunshinex	BUT, what is the variable for a given line of ulimit output?

2015-09-23 16:04:41	sunshinex	icarusdekoe: are you suggesting that values set via ulimit are not set persistently via limits.conf and/or sysctl.conf?
2015-09-23 16:04:56	icarusdekoe	ulimit is derivced from limits.conf
2015-09-23 16:05:06	icarusdekoe	sysctl.conf sets the sysctl settings
2015-09-23 16:05:08	sunshinex	ok, that's my understanding too
2015-09-23 16:05:09	icarusdekoe	they are separate
2015-09-23 16:05:27	sunshinex	sysctl supersedes limits.conf, and is a hard limit set system-wide
2015-09-23 16:05:44	sunshinex	limits.conf can be used to apply soft limits on a per-user basis, from what I understand
2015-09-23 16:06:03	icarusdekoe	for certain things
2015-09-23 16:06:20	sunshinex	so you're saying some values are not set in sysctl and/or limits.conf?
2015-09-23 16:06:21	icarusdekoe	sysctl tunes a lot more than just stack limits, nprocs etc
2015-09-23 16:06:33	sunshinex	yes, like IP and on and on 
2015-09-23 16:06:39	icarusdekoe	limits is just that, limits.
2015-09-23 16:06:45	clammy`	so I wiped it out when I was told that to import abc, and just downlaoded it
2015-09-23 16:07:21	sunshinex	perhaps an example will better illustrate what I'm trying to do, and eliminate confusion
2015-09-23 16:07:35	sunshinex	for example, to set max file descriptors: 
2015-09-23 16:08:51	icarusdekoe	limits will limit open fds for a single user
2015-09-23 16:09:08	icarusdekoe	sysctl will say, the kernel will only open N fds period
2015-09-23 16:09:08	sunshinex	right
2015-09-23 16:09:12	sunshinex	right
2015-09-23 16:09:24	sunshinex	and you can see that value by looking at ulimit -a output
2015-09-23 16:10:04	icarusdekoe	ulimit shows the per user setting
2015-09-23 16:10:19	icarusdekoe	u as in user, limit as in limit
2015-09-23 16:10:27	sunshinex	Yes, I understand that
2015-09-23 16:10:35	icarusdekoe	so... the question is?
2015-09-23 16:11:32	sunshinex	How do I know that "open files" from ulimit -a equates to /proc/sys/fs/file-max, and in sysctl.conf fs.file-max
2015-09-23 16:12:07	icarusdekoe	sysctl -l fs.file-max i think
2015-09-23 16:12:14	sunshinex	Where is a list that resolves friendly descriptions from ulimit output to a variable name I can set in sysctl.conf to persist the setting?
2015-09-23 16:12:30	sunshinex	right, but how did you (and I) know that "open files" is fs.file-max?
2015-09-23 16:12:40	icarusdekoe	https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/fs.txt
2015-09-23 16:12:40		[ http://is.gd/eKwsdK ]
2015-09-23 16:12:46	sunshinex	and what is ulimit -i, aka "pending signals"?
2015-09-23 16:13:09	sunshinex	no pending signals in there
2015-09-23 16:14:16	icarusdekoe	i dont see a sysctl parameter
2015-09-23 16:18:06	icarusdekoe	sysctl more or less directly corresponds to the procfs structure

2015-09-23 17:13:06	icarusdekoe	nothing that im aware of
2015-09-23 17:13:13	icarusdekoe	thats the point of sysctl...
2015-09-23 17:13:25	icarusdekoe	it just doesnt perist unless its in sysclt.conf
2015-09-23 17:14:37	AppAraat	so you can kind of configure the kernel options live. That's pretty cool.

2015-09-23 17:19:34	icarusdekoe	that would be hardware specific
2015-09-23 17:19:48	AppAraat	ah right
2015-09-23 17:20:06	icarusdekoe	like you cant specify the speed of a harddrive...
2015-09-23 17:20:39	icarusdekoe	and you cant necessarily flux the broadcast power of a wifi dongle

2015-09-23 17:21:18	AppAraat	but if it's supported, that would still be hw specific because it concerns external hw.
2015-09-23 17:21:26	icarusdekoe	like i have an SDR (software defined radio), and i can change the sample rate on that
2015-09-23 17:21:55	AppAraat	through sysctl?

2015-09-23 19:25:33	logiz	nah I'm thinking of p90x

2015-09-23 19:26:48	p370	so. I'm thinking of partitioning the xp lappy so as to not compeltely wipe the hdd with dual boot linux. then if i ever leave just get rid of linux and expand partition back to normal what do you guys think?
2015-09-23 19:26:49	HappyMan	and then i would've gone "no that's a terminator, etc etc"
2015-09-23 19:26:57	HappyMan	p370: sounds like a plan 
2015-09-23 19:27:38	logiz	whenever I think of k9 I think of the email application now

2015-09-23 19:32:18	HappyMan	the way i see it, computers and people are like, symbiotic opposites in the way that our thought processes/computation works
2015-09-23 19:32:21	logiz	I haven't decided which mood I'm in yet

2015-09-23 19:33:40	logiz	MIT is about making Ais awesome becaues they can calculate awesome things
2015-09-23 19:33:47	logiz	carnegie mellon ai is about making ai human like
2015-09-23 19:33:55	logiz	I don't want ai to be human like, I want it to solve problems I can't
2015-09-23 19:34:01	clammy`	ubuntu 14.04 incase that matters in terms of production and that's a large venture capitalist company
2015-09-23 19:34:21	HappyMan	i guess the ideal future would be somewhere in the middle

2015-09-23 19:35:28	HappyMan	so like, i don't want a computer to fall in love with me, but i damn sure want to be able to converse with it and have it carry a conversation ala hal 9000 
2015-09-23 19:35:34	HappyMan	not quite as sociopathic, though
2015-09-23 19:35:45	logiz	hmm
2015-09-23 19:35:50	logiz	that's an interesting thought
2015-09-23 19:35:52	logiz	the fall in love part
2015-09-23 19:36:02	logiz	because we don't really want Ai to be 'pets'
2015-09-23 19:36:06	HappyMan	well, what's his face did that whole movie
2015-09-23 19:36:08	logiz	there's some dominance on that

2015-09-23 21:09:25	slycurgus	no
2015-09-23 21:09:37	OneWitTheCore	It's an official one from Dell
2015-09-23 21:09:47	slycurgus	only flash a new bios if you know you need to, to solve a specific problem solved by the new bios
2015-09-23 21:09:53	OneWitTheCore	Okay

2015-09-23 21:21:02	OneWithTheCore	It doesn't seem to be an option, sadly
2015-09-23 21:21:30	logiz	you might be able to blacklist it in syslinux/grub
2015-09-23 21:21:38	logiz	you'd get a shitty tty but can figure it out from there
2015-09-23 21:22:01	OneWithTheCore	Can that be done in Windows
2015-09-23 21:23:55	slycurgus	might be interesting - you'd need to open up the files on the live usb and edit the syslinux config
2015-09-23 21:24:26	slycurgus	this assumes that it's using a filesystem that windows can read (which i assume it would..)
2015-09-23 21:24:33	OneWithTheCore	I think I am just going to flash the BIOS. I know its risky, but it seems like the best solution
2015-09-23 21:25:54	slycurgus	righto, good luck
2015-09-23 21:26:01	OneWithTheCore	Thanks
2015-09-23 21:26:33	slycurgus	might be a good idea to make a bios rescue disk beforehand, maybe
2015-09-23 21:26:38	slycurgus	just in case
2015-09-23 21:27:32	logiz	almost all bios updates are done from windows
2015-09-23 21:27:43	logiz	the way to do it without windows is to unpack it, and to put it on a freedos partition
2015-09-23 21:27:49	clammy`	prefilled for blu
2015-09-23 21:28:10	logiz	clammy`: your eyes are like a rainbow filled with color and yet you can't see
2015-09-23 21:28:13	clammy`	logiz: what
2015-09-23 21:28:24	OneWithTheCore	I downloaded and exe from Dell that is supposed to flash it
2015-09-23 21:29:01	slycurgus	logiz: my dead machine had something where if you gave it a fat32 usb with the .bio file on it, and set the boot jumper to 'emergency mode' and powered it, it would flash itself
2015-09-23 21:29:15	slycurgus	dunno if that's applicable to all vendors though
2015-09-23 21:29:55	slycurgus	OneWithTheCore: yeah, use that - but they may also have a rescue one for in case the flash doesn't take.. but as logiz mentioned there's probably a failsafe
2015-09-23 21:30:08	slycurgus	so if the flash fails it would just reload from a backup storage itself

2015-09-23 21:46:28	slycurgus	assuming you wiped the usb between putting distro images

2015-09-25 16:00:02	zayn	i don't know that i really type that often to need macro keys i guess
2015-09-25 16:01:01	icarusdekoe	it could be to launcha program too

2015-09-25 16:01:19	icarusdekoe	M3 -> www.google.com or something
2015-09-25 16:01:40	zayn	i purchased this keyboard mostly because i really like the way it's setup and how it feels and all the other keyboards around me are shit and i don't feel like paying like $40 for a keyboard to be shipped
2015-09-25 16:01:56	zayn	but it also has like a million macro keys and i've never had a use for them
2015-09-25 16:02:40	icarusdekoe	mine has 5
2015-09-25 16:02:48	zayn	do you use all 5?
2015-09-25 16:02:49	icarusdekoe	still havent figured out how to program them
2015-09-25 16:02:54	icarusdekoe	because linux...
2015-09-25 16:02:54	zayn	lol awesome
2015-09-25 16:03:06	icarusdekoe	they have to be "enabled" or some shit first
2015-09-25 16:03:14	icarusdekoe	so they dont even send signals...
2015-09-25 16:03:37	icarusdekoe	havent had the time or interest to go rooting around in binary firmware
2015-09-25 16:04:11	zayn	see this one isn't supported by linux, i love the shit out of the keyboard but steelseries doesn't support linux which is shitty
2015-09-25 16:04:16	icarusdekoe	but macros are far more useful for gaming than normal use anyways
2015-09-25 16:04:24	zayn	oh
2015-09-25 16:04:26	icarusdekoe	and i dont game much so i dont really care al that much
2015-09-25 16:04:29	zayn	okay well that's good to know
2015-09-25 16:04:43	icarusdekoe	its basically one key to do a series of key strokes...
2015-09-25 16:04:44	zayn	so basically i have this like giant keyboard with a million keys and i'm just goanna use it like a normal keyboard?
2015-09-25 16:04:48	zayn	sounds good. lol
2015-09-25 16:05:00	icarusdekoe	if you do the same pattern all the time... its useful to map it to one
2015-09-25 16:05:39	zayn	would this include mouse clicks?
2015-09-25 16:06:04	jholtom	sure
2015-09-25 16:06:07	jholtom	why not?
2015-09-25 16:06:08	icarusdekoe	yeah
2015-09-25 16:06:15	icarusdekoe	any input signal
2015-09-25 16:06:27	jholtom	pre-record yourself on a webcam and mic
2015-09-25 16:06:28	icarusdekoe	except for maybe mouse movement
2015-09-25 16:06:29	jholtom	map that too
2015-09-25 16:06:37	jholtom	icarusdekoe: you can take care of mouse movement with xdotool
2015-09-25 16:06:46	jholtom	at least, I think you can
2015-09-25 16:06:52	icarusdekoe	or a trained monkey
2015-09-25 16:07:34	zayn	i feel like the trained monkey is easier...
2015-09-25 16:07:35	jholtom	guys record me some obnoxious voice clips to map to various keys when playing games
2015-09-25 16:07:48	zayn	what a dick move 
2015-09-25 16:08:01	jholtom	yeah, I know
2015-09-25 16:08:12	icarusdekoe	lol... Cox took a 39 page shit on rightscorp....

2015-09-25 16:16:26	icarusdekoe	its kinda like IV threatening to sue small companies for "violating its patents"
2015-09-25 16:16:31	zayn	lol well they are getting sued for it so...
2015-09-25 16:16:43	icarusdekoe	and scaring them into licensing what are otherwise stupid-ass patents
2015-09-25 16:16:55	icarusdekoe	no, rightscorp is the plaintiff
2015-09-25 16:17:13	icarusdekoe	they arent being sued for anything
2015-09-25 16:17:44	icarusdekoe	there have been cases where the courts bar certain language of settlement letters. ongoing, i forget the exact case though...
2015-09-25 16:18:24	zayn	wait so rightscorp is not being sued they are sueing?
2015-09-25 16:18:47	icarusdekoe	yes

2015-09-25 16:20:14	icarusdekoe	have you not heard of rightscorp vefore?
2015-09-25 16:20:18	zayn	i feel like this is illegal i understand like big name companies like MGM and all that to come down and sue but not some random company who doesn't really have anything in the mix of copyright shit
2015-09-25 16:20:21	zayn	and no 
2015-09-25 16:20:32	zayn	or is wrong not illegal
2015-09-25 16:20:42	icarusdekoe	rightscorp is hired by the artists/labels
2015-09-25 16:20:50	icarusdekoe	to "protect their rights"
2015-09-25 16:20:58	icarusdekoe	so they go after alleged infringers
2015-09-25 16:20:59	zayn	oh
2015-09-25 16:21:12	zayn	so what happens if the infringers don't pay up\
2015-09-25 16:21:14	icarusdekoe	and a portion of the proceeds go to the artist, er wait no, to the label
2015-09-25 16:21:17	clammy`	the only real grade is a abuse@rackspace.org
2015-09-25 16:21:24	icarusdekoe	the artist doesnt get shit
2015-09-25 16:21:32	icarusdekoe	well then rightscorp may sue
2015-09-25 16:21:49	icarusdekoe	which is what theyd like to do here
2015-09-25 16:22:08	icarusdekoe	but, its really really hard to effectively sue a John Doe...
2015-09-25 16:22:15	icarusdekoe	and expensive
2015-09-25 16:22:19	zayn	so they can either A get more money or B get more money
2015-09-25 16:22:28	icarusdekoe	so, its easier if they just get the names, and extort the money
2015-09-25 16:22:32	icarusdekoe	more profitable
2015-09-25 16:22:39	zayn	lol so if i were to get a letter from them saying pay up and i didn't do you think they'd sue?
2015-09-25 16:22:45	zayn	or just threaten legal action?
2015-09-25 16:22:59	icarusdekoe	it depends?

2015-09-25 16:33:01	zayn	could also be because i purchased a new computer though lol
2015-09-25 16:33:39	zayn	so i know this isn't a support forum but i had a question
2015-09-25 16:33:51	zayn	idk if you could answer it
2015-09-25 16:34:03	jholtom	zayn: amarok
2015-09-25 16:34:40	zayn	no i know lol it's pertaining to installing amarok
2015-09-25 16:34:49	jholtom	oh, ok
2015-09-25 16:35:02	jholtom	fire away

2015-09-25 16:35:29	jholtom	yeah, dnf is running its syncing cronjob
2015-09-25 16:35:43	zayn	why does it take so long?
2015-09-25 16:35:45	jholtom	you can wait till it finishes, or you can use the package manager to forward your request to the listening daemon
2015-09-25 16:35:47	zayn	also how did you find all that out
2015-09-25 16:35:51	jholtom	because I use fedora
2015-09-25 16:36:01	jholtom	and thats almost always the reason I get that
2015-09-25 16:36:26	jholtom	you can also just do kill -9 7970; dnf clean all; dnf update; dnf install amarok
2015-09-25 16:36:29	jholtom	and call it a day
2015-09-25 16:37:28	zayn	okay i followed up to dnf update and got waiting for process with pid 10053 to finish
2015-09-25 16:37:36	zayn	also how do i find where these pid's are and all that?
2015-09-25 16:37:39	zayn	or what each one is

2015-09-25 16:37:45	jholtom	ps aux | grep dnf

2015-09-25 16:56:26	zayn	oh
2015-09-25 16:56:33	icarusdekoe	so at boot i assign the MAC to nic B
2015-09-25 16:56:40	zayn	oh to bypass it
2015-09-25 16:56:51	icarusdekoe	yep. quick dirty hack to get it back online
2015-09-25 16:57:08	icarusdekoe	the proper fix is to request the static for MAC of nic B
2015-09-25 16:57:18	icarusdekoe	but... i cant be arsed right now

2015-09-25 16:57:30	zayn	seems legit
2015-09-25 16:58:03	icarusdekoe	its one of those things, where if they email me ill konw instantly, but i forsee them trying for 2 weeks to figure it out
2015-09-25 16:58:12	zayn	eh
2015-09-25 16:58:36	zayn	probably seems like something that would happen at work, 2 weeks of straight problem solving because they don't want to email the previous worker
2015-09-25 16:59:06	icarusdekoe	yeah, but out of defense, ive been on the other side
2015-09-25 16:59:08	zayn	and idk just kind of what to expect as i've never done much
2015-09-25 16:59:16	zayn	oh yeah me to
2015-09-25 16:59:31	icarusdekoe	and usually the problem is that emailing a former worker... usually has hit or miss success on when or if they respond
2015-09-25 16:59:32	zayn	you don't want to look like an idiot just emailing the previous guy lol i've done the same
2015-09-25 16:59:40	icarusdekoe	oh no
2015-09-25 16:59:48	icarusdekoe	i have no problem emailing people with questions
2015-09-25 17:00:07	icarusdekoe	like "shit the fuck is this? ill just ask cause thats a way better use of my time"
2015-09-25 17:00:34	icarusdekoe	if i cant figure it out in like 15-60 minutes. im going to consult someone whos more familiar
2015-09-25 17:00:44	icarusdekoe	my time is valuable
2015-09-25 17:00:58	zayn	see i'm the opposite unless it's something that's important and needs immediate attention
2015-09-25 17:01:03	icarusdekoe	im not going to waste it trying to ferret out something that someone can explain to me in 15 seconds
2015-09-25 17:01:22	icarusdekoe	but its a judgement
2015-09-25 17:01:22	zayn	true
2015-09-25 17:01:36	icarusdekoe	knowing when to ask and when to just work at sorting it out
2015-09-25 17:02:15	icarusdekoe	typically, i explore enough to where even if i dont know the answer, i at least know enough to ask detailed questions
2015-09-25 17:02:15	zayn	always learn something new though... i work with vehicles and we troubleshot a bobcat skidsteer for a solid month as to why it wouldn't friggin move...
2015-09-25 17:02:22	clammy`	because you can set up mpd with multiuser playlists?
2015-09-25 17:02:27	zayn	makes sense
2015-09-25 17:03:04	zayn	but all it turned out to be was that the handle was kicked out to auxiliary pressure instead of drive pressure... literally a flip of the handles... 
2015-09-25 17:03:16	icarusdekoe	but yeah, ive learned more with just not giving up until i understand why a problem happened, instead of just being satisfied with the fix
2015-09-25 17:03:42	zayn	yeah
2015-09-25 17:04:04	icarusdekoe	my philosophy is: if you can't explain why your action fixed it, you dont know how to fix it
2015-09-25 17:04:16	zayn	lol or ghosts...
2015-09-25 17:04:31	icarusdekoe	there have been one or two things that are ghosts...
2015-09-25 17:04:38	icarusdekoe	like i had a server rebooting daily...
2015-09-25 17:04:59	icarusdekoe	no shutdown, nothing in logs, nothing i could discern. no crashes, even set up resource monitoring...
2015-09-25 17:05:19	icarusdekoe	i can only assume power issues. but i cant say anything for certain
2015-09-25 17:05:54	zayn	yeah
2015-09-25 17:06:03	zayn	that sounds like it would be hard to even troubleshoot
2015-09-25 17:08:32	icarusdekoe	especially without any physical access.

2015-09-26 19:36:10	slycurgus	now just need to figure out what's causing the difference..
2015-09-26 19:36:44	slycurgus	listening to music too (by virtue of said working sound)
2015-09-26 19:37:24	jrobeson	what are you listening to slycurgus ?
2015-09-26 19:37:59	slycurgus	the 'artist' is "Mayhem"
2015-09-26 19:38:19	slycurgus	i say 'artist' because it's one of a dozen or so alter-egos of a guy on Bandcamp
2015-09-26 19:38:43	slycurgus	the main artist himself goes by Renard
2015-09-26 19:40:00	jrobeson	never heard of it, what kind of music is it
2015-09-26 19:40:59	slycurgus	Renard in general is mostly electronic, faster stuff
2015-09-26 19:41:19	slycurgus	Mayhem in particular is quite electronic, quite a bit of sampling and so forth
2015-09-26 19:43:12	slycurgus	the album, if you're interested in having a listen, is http://lapfoxtrax.com/album/best-of-lapfox-vol-4-its-murder

2015-09-30 22:04:49	jrobeson	not the other way way
2015-09-30 22:05:17	jrobeson	slycurgus, you can find out ops on this server with ChanServ 
2015-09-30 22:06:11	jrobeson	or at least usually..
2015-09-30 22:08:33	slycurgus	righto - also saw mention of /who which apparently has user status
2015-09-30 22:09:15	slycurgus	just tried it out, looks like /who will be the way to go, just need to parse it
2015-09-30 22:16:38	jholtom	jrobeson: whatever, close enough
2015-09-30 22:17:06	jholtom	:P

2015-09-30 22:17:19	jrobeson	no
2015-09-30 22:17:28	jrobeson	i just went AFK for a bit

2015-09-30 22:17:57	jholtom	where was it going wrong?
2015-09-30 22:26:56	jrobeson	trying to figure out where one should include the other header files now.
2015-09-30 22:30:24	jrobeson	there we go.
2015-09-30 22:30:25	jrobeson	hmm
2015-09-30 22:30:30	jrobeson	renaming it to .cpp fixed it
2015-09-30 22:31:04	jrobeson	i was getting "identifier namespace is undefined"
2015-09-30 22:31:14	jholtom	oh dearie
2015-09-30 22:31:18	jholtom	you're mixing c and cpp
2015-09-30 22:31:26	jrobeson	that's what i said earlier
2015-09-30 22:31:31	jholtom	I totally missed that
2015-09-30 22:31:49	jrobeson	mostly because C++ seems way complicated, but the libraries I want to use are C++
2015-09-30 22:31:57	jholtom	c++ is awful
2015-09-30 22:32:04	jholtom	but, yeah, I guess...might as well if you have to
2015-09-30 22:32:06	jrobeson	the interfaces seem nice
2015-09-30 22:32:13	jrobeson	i like having real objects
2015-09-30 22:32:31	jholtom	I don't
2015-09-30 22:32:42	jrobeson	i think that I have a real fear of global variables and mutable references

2015-10-05 11:57:33	logiz	the one thing i hate about trying flavors is they don't have the nicotine in it
2015-10-05 11:57:48	logiz	so you're trying 0mg, and then come home and the 12mg makes it taste like shit
2015-10-05 11:58:09	logiz	but the thing is 12mg doesn't taste bad in general, just with certain flavors
2015-10-05 11:58:19	logiz	like ziggy stardust was 12mg and tasted great
2015-10-05 11:58:34	logiz	sour patch 12mg was kind of a neutral flavor
2015-10-05 11:58:44	logiz	fruity pebbles sucked at 12mg
2015-10-05 11:58:48	logiz	cranberry was good at 18mg
2015-10-05 11:59:04	logiz	and that's the other thing, the store I was at yesterday didn't sell anything higher than 12

2015-10-05 12:04:30	dimeshake	which is a fancy way of saying toss it in the back of a drawer for a week or two before you vape it
2015-10-05 12:04:46	dimeshake	you can also let it air out if it's real harsh - some flavors are better after breathing a while

2015-10-09 15:38:48	icarusdekoe	is part of catholic doctrine
2015-10-09 15:39:02	icarusdekoe	that was probably when there were "2" popes

2015-10-09 15:39:34	icarusdekoe	no, there is only one pope

2015-10-09 15:40:31	logiz	sometimes
2015-10-09 15:40:57	logiz	but I mean, as far as religions go, when i went to sunday school it was usually like "yeah there was like, a jesus, and we don't really know anything about anything we just think it's like it does

2015-10-09 15:42:00	logiz	easter is significantly less important than christmas though

2015-10-09 15:42:17	icarusdekoe	eh, theyre about equal...
2015-10-09 15:42:24	icarusdekoe	if anything easter is more important
2015-10-09 15:42:24	logiz	no way
2015-10-09 15:42:38	icarusdekoe	its when jesus got over his wicked ass 3 day hangover from good friday
2015-10-09 15:42:41	logiz	it might be more biblically important, but I'm pretty sure more people go to christmas mass
2015-10-09 15:42:50	icarusdekoe	no clue.
2015-10-09 15:43:01	icarusdekoe	my familly usually didnt go to either... 
2015-10-09 15:43:12	logiz	we used to go to both for a long while
2015-10-09 15:43:17	logiz	then my mom got pissed at me hating church
2015-10-09 15:43:27	icarusdekoe	every other sunday. till high school when i hit my rebellious atheist teen phase
2015-10-09 15:43:28	logiz	so I didn't go for a while, then eventually my family stopped
2015-10-09 15:43:38	logiz	that was a glorious phase
2015-10-09 15:43:46	icarusdekoe	my dad always planed golf so he could get out of it

2015-10-09 15:44:19	logiz	my mom got pissed I used to eat bacon during lent fridays
2015-10-09 15:44:20	icarusdekoe	:P
2015-10-09 15:44:48	logiz	but yeah we used to go every saturday night
2015-10-09 15:44:51	logiz	which counted as sunday
2015-10-09 15:44:55	logiz	church is so funny like that
2015-10-09 15:45:01	icarusdekoe	my parents sent me off when i refused to pray at dinner
2015-10-09 15:45:08	logiz	"oh you guys play soccer in the morning, so, lets just call saturday night sunday"
2015-10-09 15:45:10	icarusdekoe	yeah we always went on saturday..
2015-10-09 15:45:20	icarusdekoe	cause who wants to get up early?
2015-10-09 15:45:27	logiz	my grandparents always did
2015-10-09 15:45:40	logiz	it also used to be midnight mass for christmas
2015-10-09 15:45:43	logiz	who the fuck wants to do that
2015-10-09 15:45:52	icarusdekoe	we did when we were young, but then we went to brunch, so worth it
2015-10-09 15:45:59	icarusdekoe	my mom goes to midnight mass
2015-10-09 15:45:59	logiz	oh fuck you

2015-10-09 15:46:07	logiz	we never did
2015-10-09 15:46:32	icarusdekoe	we stopped eventually cause my dad lost his job and we changed churches
2015-10-09 15:46:34	logiz	the thing that always confused me is those crazy protestant sects that broke off catholicism because it was too crazy
2015-10-09 15:46:39	logiz	then stopped believing in dinosaurs
2015-10-09 15:46:51	icarusdekoe	dont forget the puritans
2015-10-09 15:47:00	icarusdekoe	and the calvanists
2015-10-09 15:47:01	logiz	I don't know much about the puritans
2015-10-09 15:47:17	icarusdekoe	they were basically fundamentalist christians before it was cool
2015-10-09 15:47:23	icarusdekoe	they got kicked out of england
2015-10-09 15:47:24	logiz	lol
2015-10-09 15:47:28	icarusdekoe	and founded murica

2015-10-09 15:47:33	logiz	that's about all I know
2015-10-09 15:47:57	icarusdekoe	they were the kind of people to stone adultueres and stuff
2015-10-09 15:48:00	logiz	the funny thing is most catholics are like, not super religious most of the time, until it's a religous time, and then they go fucking nuts
2015-10-09 15:48:11	icarusdekoe	and killing indians was ok because they were non believers
2015-10-09 15:48:40	icarusdekoe	cause catholics hate all the tradition. and hate that only they have to follow the tradition
2015-10-09 15:48:46	icarusdekoe	even though they dont.
2015-10-09 15:48:57	icarusdekoe	and then they tell everyone else theyre doing it wrong
2015-10-09 15:49:08	icarusdekoe	cause they were OP
2015-10-09 15:49:53	icarusdekoe	honestly though, it all fell off when people started marrying outside their nationalities
2015-10-09 15:50:00	logiz	I still can't think of a fucking question
2015-10-09 15:50:08	icarusdekoe	cause 100 years ago, you lived in an irish town
2015-10-09 15:50:12	icarusdekoe	and everyone was catholic
2015-10-09 15:50:20	icarusdekoe	and if you werent then beat you

2015-10-09 15:50:35	icarusdekoe	austrians to some extent

2015-10-09 15:50:40	logiz	and so are the italians
2015-10-09 15:50:47	logiz	they're all nuts in different ways though
2015-10-09 15:51:06	logiz	irish people are like "lol fuck my life, fuck everything, fuck you, life sucks, god is good, go to church, fuck everythign else"

2015-10-09 15:51:37	icarusdekoe	i think the irish secretly hate beer
2015-10-09 15:51:46	icarusdekoe	and are just trying to eliminate its existence

2015-10-09 16:35:04	DonkDonkDonk	sorry
2015-10-09 16:35:36	DonkDonkDonk	I see the LV uuid, 
2015-10-09 16:35:43	DonkDonkDonk	and I tried to use that in fstab
2015-10-09 16:35:58	icarusdekoe	is the vmdk formatted?
2015-10-09 16:36:02	DonkDonkDonk	yes
2015-10-09 16:36:07	DonkDonkDonk	full of data
2015-10-09 16:36:14	icarusdekoe	so... you need the partitions
2015-10-09 16:36:20	DonkDonkDonk	it has a partition
2015-10-09 16:36:22	icarusdekoe	not just mounting the raw dev
2015-10-09 16:36:28	DonkDonkDonk	maybe?
2015-10-09 16:36:50	DonkDonkDonk	I made a logical voluem I thought
2015-10-09 16:36:51	icarusdekoe	you did sdb1 and not sdb yes?
2015-10-09 16:36:56	jholtom	did you format the logical volume?
2015-10-09 16:37:11	DonkDonkDonk	I did sdb1
2015-10-09 16:37:23	DonkDonkDonk	and it is formatted ext4
2015-10-09 16:37:24	icarusdekoe	is it lvm or raw extfs or whatever?
2015-10-09 16:37:30	jholtom	its lvm
2015-10-09 16:37:35	jholtom	so /dev/sdb1 won't work
2015-10-09 16:37:44	jholtom	you need to do blkid /dev/storagevm/lv_storage
2015-10-09 16:37:56	jholtom	one is the pv's uuid, the other is the lv's
2015-10-09 16:37:57	DonkDonkDonk	ok, lemme try that
2015-10-09 16:38:19	icarusdekoe	yeah, or there should be like a /dev/mapper/something right jholtom ?
2015-10-09 16:38:30	icarusdekoe	been a while since i dealt with lvm...
2015-10-09 16:38:35	jholtom	icarusdekoe: yeah, should also be in /dev/mapper
2015-10-09 16:38:57	jholtom	you could also see in /dev/disk/by-uuid by looking at where the links point
2015-10-09 16:39:06	DonkDonkDonk	ls
2015-10-09 16:39:13	DonkDonkDonk	wrong window
2015-10-09 16:39:18	icarusdekoe	uuid is usually better, because its far less likely to change
2015-10-09 16:39:43	jholtom	mhm, when it comes to lvm, I tend to just use the name for readability
2015-10-09 16:39:58	DonkDonkDonk	OK
2015-10-09 16:40:07	DonkDonkDonk	I see 4 uuid in by-uuid
2015-10-09 16:40:11	icarusdekoe	that helps too. i usually just never bother to label things... 
2015-10-09 16:40:19	jholtom	ls -al /dev/disk/by-uuid
2015-10-09 16:40:36	icarusdekoe	and whenever im doing somthing lvm like, im usually installing ZFS or BtrFS
2015-10-09 16:40:58	DonkDonkDonk	Becasue this is a linux on vm, 
2015-10-09 16:41:10	DonkDonkDonk	I didn't try anything fancy with the file systems

2015-10-09 16:42:16	DonkDonkDonk	running the ls -al shows me a /dm on one of them
2015-10-09 16:42:27	DonkDonkDonk	the others are sda1
2015-10-09 16:43:20	jholtom	ls -al /dev/mapper
2015-10-09 16:43:55	DonkDonkDonk	StorageVM-lvstorage  points to dm-0

2015-10-09 16:44:11	jholtom	hm
2015-10-09 16:44:14	jholtom	is that actually lvm?
2015-10-09 16:44:19	jholtom	dm typically indicates a dmraid
2015-10-09 16:44:26	jholtom	I am so confused
2015-10-09 16:44:32	DonkDonkDonk	it is on a raid controller, but it is not in raid configuration
2015-10-09 16:44:39	jholtom	dmraid -x
2015-10-09 16:45:03	jholtom	don't run that
2015-10-09 16:45:08	jholtom	man dmraid
2015-10-09 16:45:14	jholtom	I don't know what I'm saying

2015-10-09 16:47:23	adsmz	I'm only seeing 32-bit options
2015-10-09 16:47:25	adsmz	ah ok
2015-10-09 16:47:39	jholtom	and if you're going to virtualize without those, you're going to have a bad time
2015-10-09 16:47:40	icarusdekoe	jholtom: is that required even if the host is 64bit?
2015-10-09 16:47:45	jholtom	icarusdekoe: yes!
2015-10-09 16:47:55	icarusdekoe	seems silly
2015-10-09 16:48:05	jholtom	jesus, I was virtualizing before extensions even became a thing, they are life changing
2015-10-09 16:48:15	jholtom	icarusdekoe: well, technically, you don't need them, but VBox uses them
2015-10-09 16:48:25	jholtom	because its a very shitty engine compared to the real stuff
2015-10-09 16:48:31	icarusdekoe	because they do virtual things in the processor...
2015-10-09 16:48:36	icarusdekoe	so much faster than software

2015-10-11 17:38:32	onetwouser	howdy! how are you?
2015-10-11 17:38:50	zayn	i have a weird question if i wanted to CAT multiple files such as like file00 file01 and so on is there a quicker way than just typing each one individually?
2015-10-11 17:38:55	zayn	also i'm fine how are you guys doing
2015-10-11 17:38:59	zayn	i haven't been in here in awhile :)
2015-10-11 17:39:25	slycurgus	if they all start with the same few letters, what about cat fil* ?
2015-10-11 17:41:08	zayn	ooooo
2015-10-11 17:41:32	zayn	what does the * do?
2015-10-11 17:42:03	slycurgus	the shell expands it to a list of every file it can match
2015-10-11 17:42:26	slycurgus	there's probably a better way to express that but i am known to be bad at explaining things :P
2015-10-11 17:42:29	zayn	so it'll just open all the files similar?
2015-10-11 17:42:35	zayn	no that's fine lol
2015-10-11 17:42:47	zayn	i'm learning linux by doing the overthewire games
2015-10-11 17:43:22	slycurgus	pretty much - the shell (usually bash) sees the * and turns your 'fil*' into 'file01 file02 file03' and so on, and then passes that to cat

2015-10-11 18:05:37	jrobeson	zayn, version control software is the only reason open source (and linux itself) exists. it's how groups of peoople can work together on the same software without stomping all over each others changes.  
2015-10-11 18:06:08	jrobeson	every did the thing where you mail say a word document (or other file) bank and forth and keep making changes to it?

2015-10-11 18:06:36	jrobeson	it's to avoid a situation where you'd miss changes to it

2015-10-11 18:50:01	Idkidks	I installed ubuntu 15 and it worked fine
2015-10-11 18:50:21	Idkidks	Then I downloaded kubuntu-desktop and tried to ture ubuntu into kubuntu
2015-10-11 18:50:50	Idkidks	Well after that I wanted a clean install so I install kubuntu 14
2015-10-11 18:51:07	Idkidks	I wanted 15 and forgot the version numbers
2015-10-11 18:51:38	Idkidks	I couldn't upgrade from that so I tried to install kubuntu 15 twice
2015-10-11 18:51:44	Idkidks	or maybe 3 times.
2015-10-11 18:52:03	Idkidks	I tried installing ubuntu 15 now and it does the same thing.
2015-10-11 18:52:27	Idkidks	I've used both unetbootin and pendrivelinux to mount the ISOs

2015-10-11 18:53:02	slycurgus	so your initial turn-ubuntu-into-kubuntu worked, and installing kubuntu 14 worked..?
2015-10-11 18:53:08	Idkidks	Yes.
2015-10-11 18:53:16	Idkidks	After that no bueno
2015-10-11 18:53:31	slycurgus	right
2015-10-11 18:54:06	slycurgus	so it's probably not something you're doing during the reinstall, since you did the install of k14 on top of the existing install
2015-10-11 18:54:13	slycurgus	the k15 iso boots properly etc?
2015-10-11 18:54:40	Idkidks	No I went ubuntu15 >k15
2015-10-11 18:54:59	Idkidks	k14 also after I wiped the drive worked fine
2015-10-11 18:55:20	slycurgus	was u15 -> k15 a reinstall? or just apt-get kubuntu-desktop?
2015-10-11 18:55:28	Idkidks	apt-get
2015-10-11 18:55:31	slycurgus	kk
2015-10-11 18:56:15	slycurgus	so basically.. you installed u15, and did some stuff, and now trying to install k15 by basically the same method doesn't work
2015-10-11 18:56:18	Idkidks	I've seen this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2275099 but even when I upstart I get kernel panic

2015-10-11 18:58:13	slycurgus	super weird.
2015-10-11 18:58:19	Idkidks	Yeah.
2015-10-11 18:58:33	slycurgus	nothing different about the way you wiped the later times, or anything?
2015-10-11 18:58:45	slycurgus	added hardware since the initial installs, something like that?
2015-10-11 18:59:00	Idkidks	I did the u15 install on NFTS
2015-10-11 18:59:17	Idkidks	then wiped and went to exfat
2015-10-11 18:59:25	slycurgus	...exfat?
2015-10-11 18:59:30	Idkidks	I formatted on windows
2015-10-11 18:59:32	slycurgus	i wouldn't have done it on ntfs to begin with haha
2015-10-11 18:59:46	slycurgus	ok, that's an interesting way of doing things
2015-10-11 18:59:50	Idkidks	after the 1st k15fail I think I left it unallocated
2015-10-11 18:59:58	slycurgus	hm
2015-10-11 19:00:00	Idkidks	Well I'm a newb
2015-10-11 19:00:06	Idkidks	Just started
2015-10-11 19:01:11	jrobeson	you should never install to anything but a linux native filesystem
2015-10-11 19:01:15	jrobeson	use ext4
2015-10-11 19:02:19	Idkidks	Well after the 1st I did that
2015-10-11 19:03:09	jrobeson	so have you tried getting help in the specific distor channel for your problem?
2015-10-11 19:03:22	jrobeson	most of the active people here don't use ubuntu derivatives
2015-10-11 19:03:29	jrobeson	so we can't really help as much as they could
2015-10-11 19:04:30	Idkidks	No not yet
2015-10-11 19:04:57	jrobeson	that is what you should always do first
2015-10-11 19:04:57	Idkidks	I thought you guys might have something first since multiple distros
2015-10-11 19:05:23	jrobeson	since multiple distros what?
2015-10-11 19:05:44	jrobeson	i think the regulars here use fedora, arch, gentoo, and debian , and maybe centos for servers
2015-10-11 19:06:12	Idkidks	Is there not much between u and k?
2015-10-11 19:06:23	jrobeson	but notice i didn't list ubuntu at all
2015-10-11 19:06:28	slycurgus	basically nothing between u and k - just which environment on top
2015-10-11 19:06:36	Idkidks	Huh k thanks
2015-10-11 19:06:43	Idkidks	Again, bit of a noob
2015-10-11 19:06:51	slycurgus	thus the ability to switch between them with apt-get *-desktop
2015-10-11 19:06:54	slycurgus	no worries
2015-10-11 19:06:59	Idkidks	ah.
2015-10-11 19:07:00	jrobeson	it's fine that you're new, we were all new once

2015-10-12 14:16:48	LambdaComplex	jrobeson: And what do you mean by PKGBUILDs being "immature?"
2015-10-12 14:17:32	fewt	pacman can go up down left or right
2015-10-12 14:17:40	fewt	I'm not aware of any situations where pacman can do that to itself
2015-10-12 14:17:45	fewt	ghosts can take him out though
2015-10-12 14:17:47	fewt	so be cautious
2015-10-12 14:17:53	fewt	and look for power pellets.
2015-10-12 14:18:02	fewt	LambdaComplex ^
2015-10-12 14:20:03	LambdaComplex	jholtom: Pacman verifies if you want to install/uninstall in every case I know of

2015-10-12 14:21:02	fewt	LambdaComplex yes
2015-10-12 14:21:10	fewt	LambdaComplex you're trying to get an Arch Lunix high score
2015-10-12 14:22:05	LambdaComplex	i didn't know there was a scoring system
2015-10-12 14:22:27	fewt	LambdaComplex pacman --moar-scores --yesconfirm --ircsaidso
2015-10-12 14:23:20	fewt	that or "ILoveCandy" 
2015-10-12 14:23:26	fewt	to /etc/pacman.conf
2015-10-12 14:24:15	fewt	^ that one is actually real
2015-10-12 14:25:54	LambdaComplex	fewt: I know, I already have it enabled ;)
2015-10-12 14:26:10	fewt	:)
2015-10-12 14:26:11	fewt	excellent
2015-10-12 14:30:20	fewt	of course if you were running logizduntu LambdaComplex pacman would mature PKGBUILDs all by itself
2015-10-12 14:30:34	fewt	logiz amirite?
2015-10-12 14:31:40	LambdaComplex	fewt: ?
2015-10-12 14:33:47	logiz	fewt: ur always right
2015-10-12 14:34:33	LambdaComplex	i'm seriously wondering what they meant by immature
2015-10-12 14:35:22	fewt	logiz thanks for the confirmation
2015-10-12 14:35:37	fewt	LambdaComplex they are like little kids, not grown up
2015-10-12 14:35:41	fewt	like pacman jr
2015-10-12 14:35:45	fewt	if that makes sense
2015-10-12 14:37:23	logiz	jr pacman*
2015-10-12 14:38:11	fewt	thanks for having my back logiz

2015-10-12 14:40:16	fewt	You see LambdaComplex 
2015-10-12 14:40:32	fewt	here is an example of the maturity and superiority of the yum software

2015-10-12 14:44:57	fewt	and it has less fixmes so there must be less people developing it
2015-10-12 14:45:00	logiz	that's what happens when you have a bunch of kids that didn't finish college try to create something

2015-10-12 14:57:51	fewt	logiz I think you should open up the source and add more FIXMEs so it can come up to the next level

2015-10-12 15:28:45	LambdaComplex	sometimes i wanna change a word, but it's hyphenated so vim counts it as 3 words 
2015-10-12 15:28:52	LambdaComplex	is there a better way to change it than 2dwcw?
2015-10-12 15:28:57	gtmanfred	LambdaComplex: df' '
2015-10-12 15:29:00	gtmanfred	df to a space
2015-10-12 15:29:02	gtmanfred	is what I do
2015-10-12 15:29:13	gtmanfred	df<space>
2015-10-12 15:29:20	fewt	df / is what I do
2015-10-12 15:29:20	gtmanfred	how ever you want to signify that
2015-10-12 15:29:24	fewt	and du -bh
2015-10-12 15:29:32	fewt	unless you're on a mac
2015-10-12 15:29:36	fewt	then you can only du -h
2015-10-12 15:29:39	gtmanfred	http://vim-adventures.com/
2015-10-12 15:30:07	logiz	instead of f you could just do dt<spac>
2015-10-12 15:30:17	logiz	but if it's hyphenated you use caps
2015-10-12 15:30:25	logiz	dW cW or E or whatever you need

2015-10-12 15:41:06	logiz	even if you don't plan on using vimscript it gives you a huge appreciation for how to do things in vim

2015-10-12 15:42:19	LambdaComplex	is vimscript the thing my vimrc is written in

2015-10-12 15:42:48	fewt	logiz October 21st is coming up fast
2015-10-12 15:42:50	fewt	I must prepare
2015-10-12 15:42:54	logiz	when you write plugins you can put them in your vimrc or you can put them ins tand aloen files and package them
2015-10-12 15:43:07	logiz	you could also use python, ruby, or lua
2015-10-12 15:43:28	logiz	but the bread and butter is macros and registers

2015-10-12 15:46:14	logiz	like that's also how I copy my macros
2015-10-12 15:46:17	logiz	or I add them to vimrc

2015-10-12 17:46:28	jrobeson	LambdaComplex, i am probably tained by my experience with Gentoo, but when I compare what you can do with ebuilds (not including the stuff that's really only useful for source based distros), but PKGBUILDs feel like they could learn a few lessons 
2015-10-12 17:47:53	LambdaComplex	jrobeson: The purpose of ebuilds isn't exactly the same as the purpose of PKGBUILDs
2015-10-12 17:48:14	jrobeson	that's why i said disregarding the parts really useful for source based distros
2015-10-12 17:48:47	logiz	jrobeson: how do I download something from copr after I enable it?
2015-10-12 17:48:51	jrobeson	eclasses and macros seem to be either totally missing or never used in any builds 
2015-10-12 17:48:56	jrobeson	just dnf install <package>
2015-10-12 17:49:12	jrobeson	whatever the arch equivalent of eclasses would be I mean
2015-10-12 17:49:16	logiz	meh idk the package name and it's failing to synchronize
2015-10-12 17:49:54	jrobeson	you can browse the copr repo online and look for the built packageds

2015-10-12 17:49:59	logiz	yeah that's what I did

2015-10-12 17:50:36	LambdaComplex	I'm not familiar enough with Gentoo to know what eclasses and macros are. Care to explain?
2015-10-12 17:50:48	logiz	if you're using gentoo you need to use eclasses

2015-10-12 17:59:02	jrobeson	until a bit over a month ago (or something likie that) one used to have to manually put an srpm in internet fetchable place
2015-10-12 17:59:04	jrobeson	but now.. you don't
2015-10-12 17:59:15	jrobeson	now you can directly upload the SRPM while telling it to build
2015-10-12 17:59:17	logiz	now I have to think of a stupid fucking name for fedora
2015-10-12 17:59:18	jrobeson	it used to be like this

2015-10-12 18:00:50	logiz	and don't buiild as root
2015-10-12 18:00:52	logiz	something like that
2015-10-12 18:01:05	jrobeson	well the best way to build packages is via mock . which is the same process cpr and koji use
2015-10-12 18:01:14	jrobeson	so it's a chroot
2015-10-12 18:01:28	jrobeson	and you can build rpms for many distros
2015-10-12 18:01:43	jrobeson	err many versions of the distro rather (technically other distros if there are mock config files for it)

2015-10-12 18:04:15	logiz	I figured that out at some point
2015-10-12 18:04:25	logiz	so I don't have an xdg_cache
2015-10-12 18:04:35	jrobeson	seriously? are you sure?
2015-10-12 18:04:42	logiz	I'm postive
2015-10-12 18:04:43	jrobeson	well put your own directory
2015-10-12 18:04:53	jrobeson	i just consider built rpms to be something to be thrown away
2015-10-12 18:05:02	jrobeson	since i publish to copr
2015-10-12 18:05:21	jrobeson	if you actually use your build rpms, you wouldn't want to put them in ~/.cache anyways
2015-10-12 18:05:59	logiz	hmm
2015-10-12 18:06:01	logiz	so
2015-10-12 18:06:07	logiz	when you use mock are you still the same user?
2015-10-12 18:06:10	logiz	just added to the mock group?
2015-10-12 18:06:35	gtmanfred	you can be
2015-10-12 18:06:37	jrobeson	this directory structure means that  i have ~/workspaces/rpms/<package name>/<package name>.spec 
2015-10-12 18:06:45	gtmanfred	you just have to be the mock user to write to the files where the mock chroots are
2015-10-12 18:06:46	jrobeson	yes.. and this file is irrelevant if you only use mock
2015-10-12 18:07:02	jrobeson	i don't only use mock tho

2015-10-12 18:07:21	jrobeson	i'm only in the mock group

2015-10-12 18:07:57	logiz	ah
2015-10-12 18:08:10	logiz	it's kind of confusing, but I guess I'll figure it out tonight
2015-10-12 18:08:13	logiz	then put it on my resume
2015-10-12 18:08:28	logiz	"Contributes to Fedora copr repository"

2015-10-12 18:10:04	logiz	all this just because I want to hvae a ridiculous talk about how I'm using class signatures and type hinting
2015-10-12 18:10:11	logiz	for something completely unrelated
2015-10-12 18:11:16	jrobeson	maybe you shoiuld use install it as a user and use a virtualenv so you don't accidentally kill your system python
2015-10-12 18:11:38	logiz	system python is 2.7 anyway
2015-10-12 18:11:50	logiz	I'll probably name it something like python35
2015-10-12 18:15:45	jrobeson	you have two system pythons 
2015-10-12 18:15:51	jrobeson	3.4 and 2.7
2015-10-12 18:16:09	jrobeson	remember fedora 23 is the python 3 as default version included version
2015-10-12 18:16:17	jrobeson	if package can work against a python 3, then they must
2015-10-12 18:16:41	jrobeson	you'll still likely end up with 2.7 , but it won't be required

2015-10-13 15:11:24	HappyMan	anybody here have experience using POSIX shared memory to share data across unrelated processes?
2015-10-13 15:11:27	HappyMan	i have a question about usage
2015-10-13 15:11:34	icarusdekoe	yes
2015-10-13 15:12:12	HappyMan	okay, so say I have a pre-existing shm region and I want to mmap() that region into my process space.
2015-10-13 15:12:50	icarusdekoe	right, and the question is?
2015-10-13 15:13:00	HappyMan	I use shm_open() to open the shm region and get a file descriptor, do i still have to use ftruncate() to set the size of the shm region even though it's already made?
2015-10-13 15:13:07	HappyMan	before mmap()ing it
2015-10-13 15:13:24	icarusdekoe	no you shouldnt? do you specify a size when you do the open?
2015-10-13 15:13:47	HappyMan	when i create the region initially in the other process, i set the size with ftruncate()
2015-10-13 15:13:56	icarusdekoe	er, well with the man pages is seems that you do
2015-10-13 15:14:38	icarusdekoe	if you open an existing one, you shouldnt have to set the size
2015-10-13 15:15:06	HappyMan	okay
2015-10-13 15:15:39	icarusdekoe	it works ostensibly the same as creating an actual file on a mounted /dev/shm
2015-10-13 15:15:54	HappyMan	what happens if a process resizes a shm region while other process have that region mmap()ed in?
2015-10-13 15:16:15	HappyMan	i read some rumblings about things throwing SIGBUS if it becomes smaller, but I can't anybody who says anything about the behavior
2015-10-13 15:16:20	icarusdekoe	well, if it gets larger, there shouldnt be a problem
2015-10-13 15:16:34	icarusdekoe	but smaller, would probably result in segfault or page fault
2015-10-13 15:16:44	icarusdekoe	if it allows
2015-10-13 15:17:17	icarusdekoe	i havent experimented with resizing, so i dont know if it might throw an error by making it smaller than is mapped elsewhere
2015-10-13 15:17:30	icarusdekoe	or it the error will occur on access
2015-10-13 15:18:09	HappyMan	well, i'll just YOLO it and deal with it if I run into issues
2015-10-13 15:18:47	icarusdekoe	jsut set the jumper pins on the mobo to "fuck it"
2015-10-13 15:19:17	HappyMan	i need to channel the spirit of bill o reilly

2015-10-14 21:28:02	logiz	the cherry one was 50% off, so 6.50 for a 15ml 18mg
2015-10-14 21:28:11	logiz	the othe rone was 18mg for 19 30ml
2015-10-14 21:28:23	logiz	I bought them specifically for the 18mg
2015-10-14 21:28:32	logiz	everybody was like "what you vape 18mg in a subtank?"

2015-10-14 21:29:34	logiz	sell me 36mg vg juice and I'll just squirt it into some bottles

2015-10-14 21:30:20	logiz	unicorn milk was really good 19 for 30ml
2015-10-14 21:30:36	logiz	then there was strawberry milk for 24
2015-10-14 21:30:39	dimeshake	unicorn milk is good stuff
2015-10-14 21:30:50	logiz	actually I mixed up those prices
2015-10-14 21:31:03	logiz	cause they had unicorn milk in 18mg but only in the 15ml bottle that was like 12 or 13 bucks
2015-10-14 21:31:29	logiz	and I was trying to figure out if I wanted to save 5 bucks to get a 30ml (in comparison to 2 15s)
2015-10-14 21:31:36	logiz	and I was like "eh that's the price of a coil"
2015-10-14 21:31:46	logiz	the problem with 12mg is that I'll vape it all day

2015-10-15 22:17:57	jpleau	Just yesterday I made a remark at how the "Inspect" icon in firefox was ugly compared to the chrome's, one, turns out 5 minutes later I updated to Chrome 46, they changed the inspect icon to be the same as firefox, that was funny
2015-10-15 22:18:38	slycurgus	well, there were those things recently about people getting targeted ads fro mfacebook after mentioning them in verbal conversation
2015-10-15 22:18:49	slycurgus	maybe chrome has that for UI features :P

2015-10-15 23:42:03	jrobeson	cmake still has some bad stuff

2015-10-15 23:43:30	jrobeson	i guess really.. I'd prefer to have something like a limited lua or python instead
2015-10-15 23:43:44	jrobeson	something with a saner syntax and semantics
2015-10-15 23:43:59	jrobeson	it's still better than the Makefile tho
2015-10-15 23:44:01	logiz	then why not just write something in python?
2015-10-15 23:44:23	jrobeson	because people don't want a build system to be a general purpose programming language
2015-10-15 23:44:28	jrobeson	scons is a build system in python tho
2015-10-15 23:44:47	logiz	but you don't need a general purpose language?  that's not the point of make, and I assumed cmake
2015-10-15 23:44:56	jrobeson	that's my point
2015-10-15 23:45:00	logiz	there's a lexer writing thing in the python stdlib
2015-10-15 23:45:09	jrobeson	you mean write a build system?

2015-10-16 00:12:48	logiz	interesting
2015-10-16 00:13:12	jrobeson	mysql won early mostly because it ran on windows while postgres did not easily run there

2015-10-16 00:17:15	jrobeson	also.. postgres allows recursive queries more easily
2015-10-16 00:18:00	jrobeson	it isn't easy in mysql to do say categories or comments with relations so people had to create workarounds like nested set or materialized view or adjacency list
2015-10-16 00:18:09	jrobeson	it's a lot easier to do those kinds of things in postgres
2015-10-16 00:19:32	logiz	seems like there is too much for me to learn about databases

2015-10-16 00:21:42	jrobeson	I just know enough about the major reasons why one is better than the others.. and what they let me do in one that I can't do in the other
2015-10-16 00:22:03	jrobeson	mysql has tradtionally also had an easier replication story
2015-10-16 00:22:19	jrobeson	the postgres folks seem to be finally getting to that
2015-10-16 00:22:34	jrobeson	oh.. something a lot of devs are used.. but postgres didn't have (until the soon to be released 9.5) is upserts
2015-10-16 00:22:41	logiz	yeah I read all these things and I think "huh sounds like I'm never going to use that"
2015-10-16 00:22:44	jrobeson	aka update or insert (with the same query)
2015-10-16 00:22:52	jrobeson	like what?
2015-10-16 00:23:01	logiz	any kind of recursion
2015-10-16 00:23:02	jrobeson	custom types in postgres are pretty awesome
2015-10-16 00:23:11	logiz	yeah I don't see it's use though
2015-10-16 00:23:13	jrobeson	if you ever write categories tables.. you'll be using CTEs 
2015-10-16 00:23:16	jrobeson	or comments 
2015-10-16 00:23:36	logiz	like, I was on an interview for entry data bases stuff
2015-10-16 00:23:42	logiz	and I mean, I feel I could probably do that
2015-10-16 00:23:46	logiz	just write basic queries and stuff
2015-10-16 00:24:01	logiz	but Idk about any real database stuff
2015-10-16 00:24:11	logiz	I don't know if I could really learn that advanced stuff
2015-10-16 00:24:20	logiz	hell I'm still struggling with all this other programming stuff and it's been years
2015-10-16 00:24:26	logiz	maybe I've peaked
2015-10-16 00:24:55	logiz	I just hope to get to the point that I could walk around and be like "oh that's easy" and write a quick script
2015-10-16 00:25:05	logiz	sometimes I can
2015-10-16 00:25:32	logiz	but I guess my only interests in databases right now is to do basic things
2015-10-16 00:25:45	jrobeson	if your goal is to know everything about programming ..then you'll never reach it :)
2015-10-16 00:25:57	logiz	not everything
2015-10-16 00:26:09	logiz	I'd like to get really good at comp sci though
2015-10-16 00:26:15	logiz	I also think I'd like a research position
2015-10-16 00:26:36	logiz	I kind of like the fact that I can get information better than 90% of grad students
2015-10-16 00:27:03	logiz	they could do all that fancy mumbo jumbo work, I just want to feel usefula nd say "here you go, slobs, 5 minutes of my time saved you 6 months of your time"
2015-10-16 00:27:09	logiz	in fact, I just like saving time
2015-10-16 00:27:13	logiz	even if it's not my time

2015-10-16 00:30:52	logiz	Digg is built in Python and the Tornado web framework, so comfort with these and working from the command line is a huge plus

2015-10-16 19:18:53	logiz	I think it didn't go through in september

2015-10-16 19:20:01	logiz	well they kept calling my phone and I started to ignore it
2015-10-16 19:20:07	logiz	the thing is, they call me all the time anyway
2015-10-16 19:20:21	logiz	I've answered like 2 surveys about service in the past 2 months
2015-10-16 19:20:25	logiz	err month

2015-10-16 19:20:38	logiz	blah blah
2015-10-16 19:21:20	logiz	so if the payment last month didn't go through, then I think I have like 9$ in late charges which is fine

2015-10-16 20:42:15	netsca	Does anyone know how having empty spaces in filenames works in the shell?
2015-10-16 20:47:36	slycurgus	how do you mean?
2015-10-16 20:48:20	slycurgus	you have to escape them if you want the shell to include them (rather than considering them a delimiter) but otherwise they're fairly normal
2015-10-16 20:51:50	netsca	Like how do I type them in for example if I make a folder in pcmanfm called unix stuff why when I tab complete it it echos as unix\ stuff/
2015-10-16 20:52:23	slycurgus	the backslash (\) is the escape character
2015-10-16 20:52:41	slycurgus	it tells the shell that the space (or other special character) isn't to be considered special
2015-10-16 20:52:54	slycurgus	otherwise it would be two elements 'unix' and 'stuff'
2015-10-16 20:53:25	slycurgus	if you escape the space it doesn't use the space to split, so you get 'unix stuff' as one item

2015-10-17 19:53:13	logiz	lol
2015-10-17 19:53:17	logiz	but they sell 2 different types of coils for that
2015-10-17 19:53:32	roadkill	yep
2015-10-17 19:53:34	roadkill	and there's 3 overall
2015-10-17 19:53:35	logiz	the ones I bought in the 5 pack (for your 15 bucks) is double coil, the single one I bought back home was single coil
2015-10-17 19:53:50	logiz	I got pissed at the single coil for no reason in particular
2015-10-17 19:53:51	roadkill	i'm not big on the > 1 ohm taste
2015-10-17 19:53:53	logiz	felt like they were ripping me off
2015-10-17 19:54:01	logiz	honestly I liked the 1.5 when i used it
2015-10-17 19:54:18	logiz	but when i upped my nicotine level the guy at the store was like "try .5 again" so I did, and he opened the airflow and I was like "oh this is pretty good"
2015-10-17 19:54:31	logiz	I think initially I cared more about the "full smoke" feeling cause, you know, I smoked for 7 years
2015-10-17 19:54:39	logiz	1.5 gave me more of that feeling
2015-10-17 19:54:52	logiz	but then I turned up to 30 watts and high nicotine and don't miss it at all
2015-10-17 19:54:59	logiz	roadkill: btw that fuckign cherry I got is TERRIBLE
2015-10-17 19:55:14	logiz	I suffered through a tank yesterday
2015-10-17 19:55:26	logiz	it tastes like chemicals

2015-10-17 19:55:29	+Gr33n3gg	sounds bad
2015-10-17 19:56:38	logiz	yeah
2015-10-17 19:56:42	logiz	but this raspberry is pretty good
2015-10-17 19:56:57	logiz	doesn't tastes too much like raspberry but I think that's cause the nicotine, it tasted very neutral at 0mg
2015-10-17 19:57:13	logiz	roadkill: honestly I think my favorite so far was ziggy stardust
2015-10-17 19:57:19	logiz	err starburst
2015-10-17 19:57:47	logiz	I kind of want to go back and get that strawberry milk but Idk how I'd do at 12mg nic
2015-10-17 19:58:15	roadkill	logiz: you may need to steep it
2015-10-17 19:58:22	roadkill	let the cherry sit for 2 weeks
2015-10-17 19:58:24	roadkill	shake it every day
2015-10-17 19:58:57	logiz	yeah that's what I figured
2015-10-17 19:59:03	roadkill	one of the best rated flavors I got from the new site is awful right now but everyone says it really comes into the flavor after two weeks
2015-10-17 19:59:07	logiz	when you take the cap off do you leave it hanging on, or do you literally remove it
2015-10-17 19:59:34	logiz	anyway i expected this flavor to be shit, I just didn't expect that shitty
2015-10-17 20:01:49	roadkill	Steeping is just letting it sit and shaking it up every day
2015-10-17 20:01:55	roadkill	some people like uncapping
2015-10-17 20:02:04	roadkill	i'm not sure it may much difference but allowed it to dehydrate some
2015-10-17 20:02:42	roadkill	dimeshake: vapewild is also much easier to inhale
2015-10-17 20:03:24	roadkill	i still prefer the mad alchemist custard matter but... yeah, it's a little hard to inhale a full breath of it
2015-10-17 20:03:47	logiz	yeah those thicker flavors are going to be more difficult to inhale
2015-10-17 20:03:51	logiz	idk if they use more pg or what
2015-10-17 20:04:05	logiz	but just by looking at names I have an idea for how difficult to inhale it's going to be
2015-10-17 20:04:28	logiz	you could try menthol maybe, but that sounds weird in juice to me
2015-10-17 20:05:23	logiz	so
2015-10-17 20:05:31	logiz	there is a new super pretty girl at the meetup
2015-10-17 20:05:36	logiz	I think she thinks I'm really smart

2015-10-19 21:04:07	slycurgus	apparently by not putting the company name on it i confused them terribly, because we're 8B and there's an 8C as well (and presumably an 8A but i have no idea where)

2015-10-21 21:01:11	slycurgus	....and put everyone's email address in the To: field
2015-10-21 21:01:18	slycurgus	not BCC, not even CC
2015-10-21 21:01:23	logiz	lol
2015-10-21 21:01:29	slycurgus	so i open the mail and there's a sea of people's emails
2015-10-21 21:01:49	slycurgus	confidence in real estate agents' data security: fading
2015-10-21 21:04:23	slycurgus	hm, a couple of .gov.au addresses in there
2015-10-21 21:04:52	slycurgus	i guess they'd probably only get in legal trouble for revealing where they lived, not just the real estate agent they use
2015-10-21 21:04:54	slycurgus	but still
2015-10-21 21:05:10	slycurgus	any one of these tenants could sign the rest of us up for some porno mailing list or w/e

2015-10-21 21:07:59	logiz	slycurgus: they could have done that anyway, lol
2015-10-21 21:10:22	slycurgus	yeah, but now they have a big inviting list of email addresses, rather than having to guess or brute-force or w/e
2015-10-21 21:12:58	logiz	or you know, just signing them up for gay porn to their addresses
2015-10-21 21:20:24	slycurgus	we don't have their physical addresses lol
2015-10-21 21:21:45	logiz	slycurgus: get out of the house, take down the numbers of every one you see
2015-10-21 21:21:47	logiz	done
2015-10-21 21:21:59	logiz	or just go on the real estate home page and look at recent sells or something
2015-10-21 21:22:05	logiz	but you bring up a good point
2015-10-21 21:22:14	logiz	spam is seen as much less serious in email
2015-10-21 21:22:14	JJMcHyperklauz	The sole reason to install Linux is to free yourself from the idiots that infest inferior platforms.
2015-10-21 21:22:24	slycurgus	lol, sign up all my neighbours to gay porns you say
2015-10-21 21:22:38	JJMcHyperklauz	Unfortunately though for the Linux user community, distributions like Ubuntu have made it all too easy for your mother to get a working Linux box, so they're all running in horror.
2015-10-21 21:22:59	slycurgus	JJMcHyperklauz: the internet brings everyone together anyway, there's no escape
2015-10-21 21:23:20	logiz	JJMcHyperklauz: do you not realize how many idiots use linux?
2015-10-21 21:23:26	logiz	just take a look at arch
2015-10-21 21:23:29	JJMcHyperklauz	logiz, well, like I said.
2015-10-21 21:23:33	slycurgus	logiz: oi
2015-10-21 21:23:35	slycurgus	:V
2015-10-21 21:23:37	JJMcHyperklauz	distributions like Ubuntu have made it all too easy.
2015-10-21 21:23:37	JJMcHyperklauz	BUT
2015-10-21 21:23:39	JJMcHyperklauz	in this dark hour
2015-10-21 21:23:42	JJMcHyperklauz	there was a new hope.
2015-10-21 21:24:03	logiz	linux should be easy
2015-10-21 21:24:07	logiz	it's not an iq test
2015-10-21 21:24:19	JJMcHyperklauz	Gentoo Linux, a distirubtin designed for users possessing that delicate mix of insecurity and masochism that results into an obsesion with security, optimization, and huge dollops of pain and frustration.

2015-10-21 22:13:29	jrobeson	JJMcHyperklauz, ythat's some werid stuff you're saying
2015-10-21 22:13:32	jrobeson	how old are you?
2015-10-21 22:14:14	jrobeson	JJMcHyperklauz, pretty sure you're not the type we want using linux
2015-10-21 22:14:15	jrobeson	haha
2015-10-21 22:17:04	slycurgus	such elitism, jrobeson
2015-10-21 22:17:09	jrobeson	haha
2015-10-21 22:17:12	slycurgus	you should come to Arch :P
2015-10-21 22:17:56	jrobeson	slycurgus, yeah.. i'm the kind of elite person who doesn't like "elite (l33t)" people using linux
2015-10-21 22:18:04	slycurgus	:P
2015-10-21 22:18:20	jrobeson	they can go infest openbsd
2015-10-21 22:19:03	slycurgus	the "you're not the type we want" just reminded me of the disdain i see now and then from "pure" arch users for those of e.g. antergos
2015-10-21 22:19:42	jrobeson	it reminded me of the people who bash ubuntu for being too easy to use and push arch
2015-10-21 22:21:12	slycurgus	arch is too high a barrier for new users though, from what i see
2015-10-21 22:21:29	slycurgus	better to start at ubuntu and learn, rather than run headfirst into arch and get a concussion
2015-10-21 22:21:59	slycurgus	if the goal is for linux to grow and broaden and "take over the world" i don't see why you'd want to make it difficult for people
2015-10-21 22:22:22	slycurgus	sometimes seems like that might not be some people's goal as much as a feeling of superiority, though
2015-10-21 22:22:33	jrobeson	exactly my point
2015-10-21 22:22:54	jrobeson	i have no problem with people using ubuntu because it's easy
2015-10-21 22:23:03	slycurgus	i started on ubuntu myself
2015-10-21 22:23:14	slycurgus	wouldn't use it now, but i would have died if i tried to use arch right off the bat
2015-10-21 22:23:21	jrobeson	slycurgus, maybe you misunderstood me, or I'm misunderstanding you
2015-10-21 22:23:28	JJMcHyperklauz	jrobeson, 27.
2015-10-21 22:23:28	jrobeson	my problem was with what JJMcHyperklauz was saying
2015-10-21 22:23:31	slycurgus	jrobeson: probably, it's text lol
2015-10-21 22:23:35	JJMcHyperklauz	And I just read it on some wiki.
2015-10-21 22:23:38	jrobeson	hah
2015-10-21 22:23:43	slycurgus	but i was basically agreeing with you and restating it in my own words
2015-10-21 22:23:50	jrobeson	ah. i thought you were suggesting I was being elite
2015-10-21 22:23:51	slycurgus	not trying to counter it or anything
2015-10-21 22:23:51	JJMcHyperklauz	http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Gentoo#Motivation_for_yet_another_Linux_distro jrobeson, I find hese to be most inspiring words
2015-10-21 22:23:51		[ http://is.gd/k4Hrvq ]
2015-10-21 22:23:58	slycurgus	jrobeson: lol no
2015-10-21 22:23:59	jrobeson	JJMcHyperklauz, i was referring to what you said about arch
2015-10-21 22:24:06	slycurgus	that first bit about elitism was 100% facetious
2015-10-21 22:24:08	JJMcHyperklauz	jrobeson, what did I say about ARch?
2015-10-21 22:24:10	JJMcHyperklauz	I forgot?
2015-10-21 22:24:33	slycurgus	the only one that mentioned arch inthe earlier discussion was logiz
2015-10-21 22:24:36	jrobeson	ah yeah
2015-10-21 22:24:39	jrobeson	i mixed up lines
2015-10-21 22:24:40	JJMcHyperklauz	Slander
2015-10-21 22:24:41	jrobeson	i meant this one <JJMcHyperklauz> The sole reason to install Linux is to free yourself from the idiots that infest inferior platforms.
2015-10-21 22:24:43	JJMcHyperklauz	against my good name.
2015-10-21 22:24:53	JJMcHyperklauz	Ah yes.
2015-10-21 22:24:59	JJMcHyperklauz	Well, that is what I read on that page.
2015-10-21 22:25:03	JJMcHyperklauz	I find it to be most inspiring wors.
2015-10-21 22:25:14	jrobeson	sarcastically?
2015-10-21 22:26:42	JJMcHyperklauz	I'm never sure to be honest.
2015-10-21 22:26:45	JJMcHyperklauz	If I actually believe it or not.
2015-10-21 22:27:41	jrobeson	i asked how old you are.. because i have a hard time imagining an adult person actually beleiving it
2015-10-21 22:27:45	jrobeson	believing*
2015-10-21 22:28:06	JJMcHyperklauz	And you were wrong.
2015-10-21 22:28:14	JJMcHyperklauz	How interesting, your imagination is limited isn't it.
2015-10-21 22:28:19	JJMcHyperklauz	But your ageism is duly noted.
2015-10-21 22:28:24	slycurgus	heh
2015-10-21 22:28:31	jrobeson	yeah.. i expect adults to think and act like adults.. and not 15 year olds
2015-10-21 22:28:35	jrobeson	who wanna show off their epeen
2015-10-21 22:28:43	slycurgus	jrobeson: ....have you *been* on the internet???
2015-10-21 22:28:48	slycurgus	:P
2015-10-21 22:28:49	logiz	jrobeson: I think you were just called retarded
2015-10-21 22:28:51	*	logiz flares up
2015-10-21 22:28:53	jrobeson	slycurgus, my internet experience is curated 
2015-10-21 22:28:57	JJMcHyperklauz	Ah yes, of course, when you're wrong someone is just "acting like a 15 year old"
2015-10-21 22:29:11	JJMcHyperklauz	Why live by critical ways if you can also live in a self fulfilling prophecy.
2015-10-21 22:29:25	jrobeson	you're gonna have to spell that out for me
2015-10-21 22:29:35	logiz	there's a lot of sarcasm in this chat, because none of us takes linux too seriously
2015-10-21 22:29:43	JJMcHyperklauz	Anyway, I find there is some merit to the idea.
2015-10-21 22:29:45	JJMcHyperklauz	Take OS X for instance
2015-10-21 22:29:50	logiz	the whole elitism is what's stupid
2015-10-21 22:29:54	JJMcHyperklauz	I mean, it's close enough to GANU slash Lunix.
2015-10-21 22:29:56	jrobeson	slycurgus, i choose to be involved in open source projects mostly.. and people are pretty reasonable there
2015-10-21 22:30:07	JJMcHyperklauz	But it's in practice culturally inferior as it does not weed out the idiots enough.
2015-10-21 22:30:10	jrobeson	i don't go to the parts of the itnent you're talking about 
2015-10-21 22:30:17	jrobeson	culturally inferior..
2015-10-21 22:30:20	jrobeson	wowzers
2015-10-21 22:30:27	JJMcHyperklauz	Same with say IRC, on a technical level it's actually a pretty bad protocol, but it's just barely not trivial enough to use that it keeps the idiots out.
2015-10-21 22:30:36	jrobeson	some of the best developers use osx as a dev platform..
2015-10-21 22:30:50	JJMcHyperklauz	I don't see how that disputes my thesis.
2015-10-21 22:30:52	jrobeson	i don't , but i don't consider htem culturally inferiror 
2015-10-21 22:31:01	JJMcHyperklauz	I said it doesn't keep idiots out, I never said it doesn't let smart people in.
2015-10-21 22:31:02	slycurgus	jrobeson: i believe you are experiencing an encounter with what we call 'hyperbole'
2015-10-21 22:31:12	JJMcHyperklauz	Quite so.
2015-10-21 22:31:22	jrobeson	then how about be serious
2015-10-21 22:31:38	jrobeson	if you got something to say.. say it plain.
2015-10-21 22:31:39	logiz	thesis
2015-10-21 22:31:40	logiz	lol
2015-10-21 22:31:41	slycurgus	jrobeson: see earlier comment about "have you been on the internet"
2015-10-21 22:31:45	slycurgus	'tis a silly place
2015-10-21 22:31:47	slycurgus	etc etc
2015-10-21 22:31:53	jrobeson	i've obviously bene on the internet.. just not those parts
2015-10-21 22:32:14	slycurgus	...i'm not actualyl questioning if you have been on the internet
2015-10-21 22:32:15	jrobeson	that's why i asked if serious though
2015-10-21 22:32:15	logiz	I go on those parts for jrobeson 
2015-10-21 22:32:22	JJMcHyperklauz	"In fact, if the users don't crash their box at least once a week due to new and untested software they will swarm onto the forums and accuse Gentoo of "going all Debian" on them."
2015-10-21 22:32:26	JJMcHyperklauz	I find that line to be most motivational
2015-10-21 22:32:27	slycurgus	sarcasm and text do not mix well lol
2015-10-21 22:32:35	jrobeson	that's why we have </sarcasm> tags
2015-10-21 22:32:36	slycurgus	logiz: you're a saint
2015-10-21 22:32:47	logiz	I know slycurgus 
2015-10-21 22:32:48	jrobeson	and that's why i asked if sarcasm
2015-10-21 22:33:01	JJMcHyperklauz	Well
2015-10-21 22:33:02	logiz	my recent argument about why vim is better than emacs, cause vim supports the uganda children
2015-10-21 22:33:03	slycurgus	typing <sarcasm> is difficult
2015-10-21 22:33:06	JJMcHyperklauz	I dislike Linus Torvalds.
2015-10-21 22:33:14	slycurgus	i have to protect my delicate fingers as much as possible
2015-10-21 22:33:21	JJMcHyperklauz	Quite so.
2015-10-21 22:33:26	JJMcHyperklauz	Also, it ruins my fine sense of humour.
2015-10-21 22:33:34	slycurgus	so i just type whatever and rely on others to weed out the things that i say that are humorous
2015-10-21 22:33:44	JJMcHyperklauz	Always, always rely on others.
2015-10-21 22:33:50	JJMcHyperklauz	THat is basically why FOSS exists.
2015-10-21 22:33:54	slycurgus	not to mention - half the amusement comes from others not knowing quite what is humour and what is not
2015-10-21 22:33:55	jrobeson	hah
2015-10-21 22:34:03	JJMcHyperklauz	Quite so, quite so.
2015-10-21 22:34:11	logiz	this chat is so interesting right now
2015-10-21 22:34:13	logiz	and yet
2015-10-21 22:34:14	jrobeson	JJMcHyperklauz, i seriously do not worship linus..  seriously
2015-10-21 22:34:15	logiz	hockey is interesting
2015-10-21 22:34:22	jrobeson	hockey is hocky
2015-10-21 22:34:25	slycurgus	logiz: you dropped your sarcasm tag there bruh
2015-10-21 22:34:29	slycurgus	:P
2015-10-21 22:34:32	jrobeson	japanese post hardcore
2015-10-21 22:34:39	JJMcHyperklauz	I despise Linus
2015-10-21 22:34:44	JJMcHyperklauz	He's one of those people who believes in "just works"
2015-10-21 22:34:45	jrobeson	wowzers.. it's in english
2015-10-21 22:34:52	logiz	slycurgus: I just use xpath now
2015-10-21 22:34:57	logiz	//sarcasm
2015-10-21 22:35:01	JJMcHyperklauz	And then he rants about OpenSuSE "just working" just not how he wants it to.
2015-10-21 22:35:14	jrobeson	huh? i don't even remember that having a basis in reality
2015-10-21 22:35:16	JJMcHyperklauz	"omg you have a policy setting by default I don't agree with that I can easily change, you are retarded, all of you!"
2015-10-21 22:35:18	jrobeson	i thought it was fedora 
2015-10-21 22:35:31	logiz	no
2015-10-21 22:35:33	logiz	it was suse
2015-10-21 22:35:36	logiz	but this is misconstrued
2015-10-21 22:35:43	logiz	it was about how you needed sudo to print
2015-10-21 22:35:47	JJMcHyperklauz	Yeah
2015-10-21 22:35:48	jrobeson	he uses fedora and complained about gnome
2015-10-21 22:35:51	JJMcHyperklauz	And add wifi.
2015-10-21 22:35:53	jrobeson	that's all i remember
2015-10-21 22:35:55	JJMcHyperklauz	He did that too.
2015-10-21 22:35:58	logiz	it was on his daugher's laptop
2015-10-21 22:36:00	JJMcHyperklauz	Add a wifi network
2015-10-21 22:36:07	jrobeson	aha.. his daughters laptop
2015-10-21 22:36:12	JJMcHyperklauz	No, it was his he leant to his daughter
2015-10-21 22:36:17	JJMcHyperklauz	Without giving her root
2015-10-21 22:36:21	logiz	whatever, it was like 3 years ago
2015-10-21 22:36:26	JJMcHyperklauz	And then she couldn't add a printer without getting root.
2015-10-21 22:36:31	JJMcHyperklauz	So he thought that was dumb
2015-10-21 22:36:33	jrobeson	visual kei is weird
2015-10-21 22:36:39	logiz	either way, yaast is what makes suse suck
2015-10-21 22:36:41	JJMcHyperklauz	But the point is, you can easily change that policy.
2015-10-21 22:36:47	jrobeson	but you shouldn't have to
2015-10-21 22:37:05	JJMcHyperklauz	There are reasons to not allow ordinary users to add a printer even if they have the seat.
2015-10-21 22:37:26	jrobeson	seems like a specialized case tho.
2015-10-21 22:37:30	JJMcHyperklauz	But I find it most ironic because he's constantly bitching that he wants a system to "just work" without any configuration.
2015-10-21 22:37:30	jrobeson	i wonder how it is on a mac
2015-10-21 22:37:41	JJMcHyperklauz	And the main problem with "just work" is that it'll "work" just not how you want to.
2015-10-21 22:37:43	slycurgus	JJMcHyperklauz: i think i agree with jrobeson - a default install should be usable out of the box, and any securing that needs to happen should be an active effort by the admin
2015-10-21 22:37:45	jrobeson	i don't think he expects enterprise configurations to just work 
2015-10-21 22:37:46	JJMcHyperklauz	And now he's bitten by that.
2015-10-21 22:37:56	slycurgus	assuming that that's the point of contention
2015-10-21 22:37:57	jrobeson	those are always special
2015-10-21 22:38:04	jrobeson	whoa.. weirdness
2015-10-21 22:38:06	JJMcHyperklauz	slycurgus, so a default install should not hve user accounts at all and boot as root?
2015-10-21 22:38:10	JJMcHyperklauz	Like, where do you draw the lines.
2015-10-21 22:38:44	jrobeson	huh?
2015-10-21 22:38:46	slycurgus	haha, yeah, for sure there's a sliding scale to it... kind of up for interpretation
2015-10-21 22:38:51	logiz	slycurgus: ofc things should just work out of the box
2015-10-21 22:38:54	jrobeson	root for regular user is never ok
2015-10-21 22:38:59	slycurgus	booting as root is bad, but the user having no access to their own machine is also bad
2015-10-21 22:39:02	logiz	configs were for like 2000
2015-10-21 22:39:09	JJMcHyperklauz	slycurgus, the user has access just fine.
2015-10-21 22:39:14	JJMcHyperklauz	Just not the user that can't get root
2015-10-21 22:39:25	logiz	either way, if you don't like linus use garretts fork
2015-10-21 22:39:32	JJMcHyperklauz	Which is sort of the reason you give someone an account that can't get root
2015-10-21 22:40:02	JJMcHyperklauz	But I find the irony hilarious, the guy is constantly hopping distro and DE because he doesn't like their DEFAULT settings.
2015-10-21 22:40:06	slycurgus	what i mean is - i feel like "add a printer" is a safe enough operation that it should be available by default unless actively denied to a user
2015-10-21 22:40:10	JJMcHyperklauz	All the while bitching that doesn't have the "time" to set his system up.
2015-10-21 22:40:25	JJMcHyperklauz	If he'd just set it up once the way he wanted he wouldn't have to keep hopping and would've saved time by now.
2015-10-21 22:40:30	slycurgus	other oprtations obviously would be different
2015-10-21 22:40:36	jrobeson	he's not always jumping is he?
2015-10-21 22:40:39	slycurgus	JJMcHyperklauz: and miss out on all this delightful yelling?
2015-10-21 22:40:42	slycurgus	:P
2015-10-21 22:40:45	jrobeson	i'm pretty sure he's been using fedoar exclusively for years now?
2015-10-21 22:40:48	jrobeson	fedora*
2015-10-21 22:40:54	jrobeson	for his own box i mean
2015-10-21 22:41:27	JJMcHyperklauz	jrobeson, he has, but before that he was constantly hopping and he'sstill hopping DE's.
2015-10-21 22:41:37	jrobeson	when was the last time he hopped from GNOME?
2015-10-21 22:41:37	JJMcHyperklauz	Basically, he hops if he doesn't like the default settings, it's quite amusing.
2015-10-21 22:41:46	JJMcHyperklauz	I believe he's using KDE now.
2015-10-21 22:42:02	jrobeson	pretty sure KDE was just a short stint between gnomes.. unless i missed it
2015-10-21 22:42:11	jrobeson	between some early 3.x versions
2015-10-21 22:42:12	JJMcHyperklauz	THere are none in Linux whom I hate more than Sarah Sharp though.
2015-10-21 22:42:15	JJMcHyperklauz	I dispise her.
2015-10-21 22:42:19	jrobeson	...
2015-10-21 22:42:27	jrobeson	give up your usb 3 in prtest
2015-10-21 22:43:00	JJMcHyperklauz	I think that argument is always so weird "Without her we wouldn't have ...", I mean, they would've just paid another.
2015-10-21 22:43:15	JJMcHyperklauz	I'm also scpeitcal of Linux existing is even a good hing, without Linux GNU would be forced to finish the hurd which might've been better.
2015-10-21 22:43:25	JJMcHyperklauz	But anyway, this is a personal attack, not a professional one.
2015-10-21 22:43:31	jrobeson	now you're just wasting our time 
2015-10-21 22:43:35	JJMcHyperklauz	I don't speak to the quality of her code, just that I pesonally very much dislike her.
2015-10-21 22:43:56	jrobeson	i'm glad shes speaking out against linus being so douchy
2015-10-21 22:44:03	jrobeson	dude is douchy
2015-10-21 22:44:33	jrobeson	i wanna take him out and send him into a relevant community that he has to learn how to interact with
2015-10-21 22:44:37	jrobeson	get a taste of his own medicine
2015-10-21 22:45:11	JJMcHyperklauz	I don't care about his being douchy.
2015-10-21 22:45:19	logiz	that's what you get when you're a benevolent dictator though
2015-10-21 22:45:27	JJMcHyperklauz	But I dislike sharp because she's a openly racist and sexist twat.
2015-10-21 22:45:33	jrobeson	racist?
2015-10-21 22:45:33	JJMcHyperklauz	Oh wait, no, I mean """reverse""" racist and sexist.

2015-10-22 20:16:30	jpleau	let's get to it :D

2015-10-22 20:18:54	logiz	slycurgus: I just listened to my voice mails, first guy was pretty clear, I got his cell I'll probably give him a call and say I was in manhattan all day with a dead phone
2015-10-22 20:19:01	logiz	next two messages, i couldn't understand a fucking word
2015-10-22 20:19:20	logiz	they were both foreign, maybe indian or something, but more importantly than their thick accents was they fucking whispered in the phone
2015-10-22 20:19:27	slycurgus	jpleau: can you share the idea? or is it super secret
2015-10-22 20:19:46	slycurgus	logiz: they had a special opportunity just for you and couldn't talk too loud
2015-10-22 20:19:47	logiz	slycurgus: so I turned on speaker, put my ear to it, struggled to hear, and then my phone was like END OF MESSAGE I fucking jumped out of my seat
2015-10-22 20:19:53	slycurgus	lol
2015-10-22 20:20:08	logiz	jpleau: python based, I'll help
2015-10-22 20:21:18	jpleau	basically, it'll be a platformer game (like the mario bros snes games?) But it'll play multiplayer, each player will see a "layer" of the levels, and they'll need to communicate with each other to advance
2015-10-22 20:21:20	logiz	this one guy sent me an email saying "Hello partners"
2015-10-22 20:21:21	logiz	wtrf
2015-10-22 20:21:32	jpleau	one might see platforms, the other will see enemies
2015-10-22 20:21:42	logiz	jpleau: heh, that sounds like that bomb game, but platform based
2015-10-22 20:21:52	jpleau	what bomb game
2015-10-22 20:21:59	jpleau	ahh yeah.
2015-10-22 20:22:01	logiz	there's some game that keeps showing up on the front page
2015-10-22 20:22:02	jpleau	I got the idea from that, lol.
2015-10-22 20:22:04	logiz	haha
2015-10-22 20:22:06	jpleau	We play that during breaks at work
2015-10-22 20:22:18	logiz	that's an interesting idea though
2015-10-22 20:22:21	logiz	JUMP
2015-10-22 20:22:23	logiz	you died
2015-10-22 20:22:25	logiz	fucking idiot
2015-10-22 20:22:27	slycurgus	jpleau: oo, sounds kinda like Blink
2015-10-22 20:22:31	logiz	jpleau: the good thing is that a blind person can play that game
2015-10-22 20:22:32	slycurgus	or whatever they renamed it to
2015-10-22 20:22:46	jpleau	I have ideas like, one guy getting a "key/switch" at the end of the level, bring it to the other player, "teleports" it to the other layer, etc
2015-10-22 20:23:00	logiz	jpleau: you should have it so the teleport switches their roles
2015-10-22 20:23:03	slycurgus	3d platformer where you can only see half the world at a time, and you "blink" between seeing e.g. a wall and a gap vs no wall and a floor
2015-10-22 20:23:05	logiz	one guy gets the switch, other guy ha to bring it back!
2015-10-22 20:23:21	jpleau	slycurgus: hmm yea I guess that's similr
2015-10-22 20:23:25	logiz	and the level changes on the way back ofc
2015-10-22 20:24:04	jpleau	I wanted to make it something like "light world" / "dark world" a la zelda lol
2015-10-22 20:24:06	slycurgus	except blink is single-player ofc
2015-10-22 20:24:12	slycurgus	the multiplayer sounds like a nice twist
2015-10-22 20:24:14	jpleau	but both world interact in the same "world"
2015-10-22 20:24:37	jpleau	complete each other, etc. It will be a nice challenge to do that if I decide to go ahead
2015-10-22 20:25:41	slycurgus	portal 2 co-op mode could probably inspire you with some puzzle ideas :P
2015-10-22 20:25:57	jpleau	its not that kind of coop tho
2015-10-22 20:26:17	slycurgus	though ditching the quasi-scientific setting could probably get you some more interesting elements than portal had
2015-10-22 20:28:45	jpleau	I might have to look into Box2D, I'd like to have puzzles with gravity
2015-10-22 20:33:42	logiz	um

2015-10-28 17:25:03	@logiz	The SUBOX Nano Starter Kit comes with a 510 drip tip
2015-10-28 17:25:09	@logiz	rat: that will be 50$ please

2015-10-28 17:27:53	dimeshake	rat: yeah uses te same style drip tip. does not come with one (mine didn't, anyway)
2015-10-28 17:28:00	dimeshake	i use my kanger tip on it
2015-10-28 17:28:37	rat	dimeshake: perfect. Any real difference with these models beside shape? Found a IGo W vs IGo W4 for about the same price
2015-10-28 17:28:56	dimeshake	nah i don't think so. oh - the air holes that come stock are really tiny. get whichever has bigger ones
2015-10-28 17:29:03	dimeshake	the guys i bought mine from pre-drilled the holes for a little better airflow
2015-10-28 17:29:27	rat	i prefer smaller airholes surprisingly
2015-10-28 17:29:36	rat	i like drag on the inhale
2015-10-28 17:29:53	@logiz	that's boring
2015-10-28 17:29:57	@logiz	add more airflow!
2015-10-28 17:30:05	@logiz	dimeshake: the fuck is a managed switch
2015-10-28 17:30:16	@logiz	sounds like it's literally just remote config
2015-10-28 17:30:23	@logiz	so that begs the question, wtf is unmanaged?
2015-10-28 17:30:30	rat	i can always drill it myself
2015-10-28 17:30:38	@logiz	rat: no you can't you do puters you have no hands for drilling
2015-10-28 17:30:41	rat	logiz: unmanaged is basically plug and no config.
2015-10-28 17:30:42	dimeshake	logiz: managed switch can do stuff. unmanaged switch just switches
2015-10-28 17:30:58	@logiz	so what does a switch actually do?
2015-10-28 17:31:07	rat	logiz: Since I defined unmanaged switch for you, i'll send you an invoice that negates your previous invoices.
2015-10-28 17:31:15	@logiz	rat: D:
2015-10-28 17:31:16	dimeshake	bwahaha
2015-10-28 17:31:16	rat	switch = dumb router
2015-10-28 17:31:30	@logiz	yeah but you need a router at some point, a switch just splices it eh?
2015-10-28 17:31:38	rat	a switch is a NAT extension
2015-10-28 17:31:50	rat	literally a splitter.
2015-10-28 17:31:51	rat	yeah
2015-10-28 17:32:08	@logiz	that's what I thought
2015-10-28 17:32:14	@logiz	I was just asked if I understood managed switches
2015-10-28 17:32:14	rat	pretty transparent, too. They work well for their purposes as long as the switch has more bandwidth than your connection and total setup needs.
2015-10-28 17:32:15	@logiz	I said yes
2015-10-28 17:32:22	@logiz	yeah
2015-10-28 17:32:38	rat	managed switches basically have an IP you can log into and modify settings like routers
2015-10-28 17:32:50	rat	so... router - isp stuff = managed switch
2015-10-28 17:32:50	@logiz	I literally just googled it and saw "usually some type of remote setting up, like ssh" and I'm like "oh I can do ssh"
2015-10-28 17:33:05	icarusdekoe	rat: managed swtich != router though...
2015-10-28 17:33:08	rat	that's another billable hour.
2015-10-28 17:33:14	icarusdekoe	it just lets you do things like vlans
2015-10-28 17:33:20	icarusdekoe	or kill individual ports
2015-10-28 17:33:23	rat	icarusdekoe: i'm oversimplifying, but yeah, you're right
2015-10-28 17:33:37	@logiz	but essentially as soon as I touch it I'm sure I'll understand it
2015-10-28 17:33:42	icarusdekoe	it doesnt do nat or dhcp like routers do
2015-10-28 17:33:50	rat	managed switches have a lot of fine tuning control over the switch itself. nothing you couldn't figure out after some googling, logiz 
2015-10-28 17:33:57	@logiz	I'm hesitant to follow up withthis position anyway,it's kind of far, probably only like 40k paid
2015-10-28 17:34:11	@logiz	rat: I treat most things like that
2015-10-28 17:34:20	@logiz	so i've started answering all questions with "yes I can do that"
2015-10-28 17:34:23	rat	icarusdekoe: most switches just do port duplication, right?
2015-10-28 17:34:31	rat	eg cheap netgear ones in staples
2015-10-28 17:34:42	@logiz	cause if you're honest and say "I haven't used it, but I can look it up" people think you're a moron
2015-10-28 17:34:51	@logiz	I wait until I fall into a trap and say "well I wasn't going ot get anywhere anyway"
2015-10-28 17:34:53	icarusdekoe	rat: basically. whatever goes in gets launched out all the ports
2015-10-28 17:34:58	rat	logiz: instead of saying that, say "I'll get right on it"
2015-10-28 17:35:26	rat	logiz: what i've been doing for the past week is learning broadcast automatino software from scratch. 
2015-10-28 17:35:32	@logiz	rat: maybe if you're employed for a company but basic interview questions, recruiters, blah blah, they just want to hear yes
2015-10-28 17:35:41	@logiz	D:
2015-10-28 17:36:00	@logiz	icarusdekoe: do you have any idea where I can watch a video or read about a basic overview of data structures without too much theory?
2015-10-28 17:36:00	rat	i already got called a genius once just because i tried drag and dropping playlist files into the currently playing playlist. Something you could do since Winamp 2, for fuck's sake
2015-10-28 17:36:15	@logiz	icarusdekoe: I just gotta learn it quickly and this 700 page book isn't getting read in one n ight

2015-10-28 17:41:32	@logiz	icarusdekoe: the only thing that's complicated about them to me is implmenting them, i get too wrapped up in words and other bullshit
2015-10-28 17:42:03	@logiz	icarusdekoe: this book on datastructures I've been reading, it starts writing a tree by writing an 80 line "helper class" for the tree
2015-10-28 17:42:19	@logiz	last night I was like "I should actually learn to do it right for an interview (that I had this morning)

2015-10-28 17:43:05	@logiz	icarusdekoe: but the thing that gets me, is when recursion collapses on itself
2015-10-28 17:43:15	@logiz	icarusdekoe: also I had to write factorial today
2015-10-28 17:43:20	@logiz	the guy wouldn't shut up while I was doing it
2015-10-28 17:43:28	icarusdekoe	bleh, such a boring example.

2015-10-28 17:47:52	@logiz	so i kept saying haskell "with an H"
2015-10-28 17:48:03	@logiz	they wanted me to write an array
2015-10-28 17:48:24	icarusdekoe	haskell doesnt have arrays
2015-10-28 17:48:27	icarusdekoe	it has lists

2015-10-28 17:48:33	@logiz	but
2015-10-28 17:48:41	@logiz	they wanted me to write a low level array or something
2015-10-28 17:48:59	@logiz	so I was like "um, even C has arrays built in, you want me to just draw you memory blocks and say "here's a memory here's a thing?"
2015-10-28 17:49:12	@logiz	apparently they wanted me to just draw literally the square representation
2015-10-28 17:49:19	rat	...
2015-10-28 17:49:23	@logiz	WHERE DOES IT START LEFT OR RIGHT?
2015-10-28 17:49:34	@logiz	I got confused I'm like "did you just draw me a byte?
2015-10-28 17:49:41	@logiz	"you want me to write it in binary? it starts on the right then"
2015-10-28 17:49:43	@logiz	NO AN ARRAY
2015-10-28 17:49:52	@logiz	Oh so you want me to start on the left and write the numberes in box by box?
2015-10-28 17:49:57	@logiz	IDK HOW DOES AN ARRAY WORK
2015-10-28 17:50:10	rat	This is what happens when managers are hired when they don't know how to do the things they're hiring for.
2015-10-28 17:50:35	@logiz	so eventually it got to the point where I'm like "this is an array, it's a memory location, it stores a value, that value can have a pointer that represents it"
2015-10-28 17:50:38	@logiz	HOW DO YOU ITERATE THROUGH AN ARRAY
2015-10-28 17:50:46	@logiz	um, you just add one to the pointer
2015-10-28 17:50:57	@logiz	I felt so patronized

2015-10-28 17:53:21	@logiz	icarusdekoe: I'm just really down on myself too cause I should know datastructures better, I feel like a moron half the time, but I mean, the reason I've been using python is because it's easier to implement stuff
2015-10-28 17:54:05	icarusdekoe	yeah... tech questions get way to caught up on intricacies like that that dont matter
2015-10-28 17:54:21	@logiz	like the first thing the guy said was "why do you use python and nothign else"  "python is easier to develop things in"  "you only want to do easy things?"  "no, I want to do everything without tripping over language constraints because of verbose syntax and things that should be in the stdlib"
2015-10-28 17:54:24	icarusdekoe	do you get endless questions about big O runtime of whatever the fuck your implementing?
2015-10-28 17:54:48	@logiz	icarusdekoe: I got 3 basic questions about big O, and I got them all right
2015-10-28 17:55:01	icarusdekoe	"i like using python... its easy to do what i want. why would i want to make things harder than they have to be?"
2015-10-28 17:55:04	@logiz	I was like "oh that's linear time"  and they wanted me to write it on the board so I wrote O(n) lol
2015-10-28 17:55:25	icarusdekoe	yeah big O is pretty easy really
2015-10-28 17:55:35	@logiz	I like big O because ther eisn't much thought into it
2015-10-28 17:55:48	icarusdekoe	its an upper bound.
2015-10-28 17:55:50	@logiz	the other types of stuff around it is kind of annoying
2015-10-28 17:55:59	icarusdekoe	so linear is also O(n^2) :P
2015-10-28 17:56:00	@logiz	I don't know the k or whatever other versions there is
2015-10-28 17:56:24	icarusdekoe	what they really are askign for is big theta
2015-10-28 17:56:33	@logiz	oh theta that's it
2015-10-28 17:56:44	icarusdekoe	which is big O and big omega
2015-10-28 17:57:05	@logiz	so they got really onto me about relational databases, and Idk, I just blanked out and forgot the syntax
2015-10-28 17:57:21	icarusdekoe	bleh
2015-10-28 17:57:22	@logiz	so they were like "forget the database how would you compare elements in both lists
2015-10-28 17:57:28	@logiz	so I was like "in python?  a - b
2015-10-28 17:57:32	@logiz	"not in python"
2015-10-28 17:57:35	@logiz	um, what do you wnat me to do?
2015-10-28 17:57:39	@logiz	"do you remember math?"  um...
2015-10-28 17:57:41	@logiz	"it's sets"
2015-10-28 17:57:51	@logiz	"a list isn't a set though otherwise I'd have said it"
2015-10-28 17:57:55	@logiz	"so just do sets then"
2015-10-28 17:58:19	icarusdekoe	just... compare the elements?
2015-10-28 17:58:28	icarusdekoe	i... the fuck question is that?
2015-10-28 17:58:43	@logiz	yup

2015-10-28 17:59:23	rat	they're too combative over trivial details
2015-10-28 17:59:27	@logiz	and I kept saying "I forgot how to write how to access foreign keys, I'm sorry, but obviously if you have an employee you can compare the primary and foreign key to get the departmen tthey're in, but Idk how to do it the other way"
2015-10-28 18:00:05	@logiz	rat: this company is willing to pay me double the salary of a job I'd expect to get
2015-10-28 18:00:38	@logiz	so I interviewed with like 8 people today, I'm going for a 2nd interview later on, I think the first part of it the people must have said something like "he definitely knows python and how to build classes and objects"
2015-10-28 18:00:51	@logiz	cause the other people probably didn't want me in the office anymore lol

2015-10-29 12:52:32	@logiz	I'm pretty positive that I answered a phone call while asleep and said "THE FUCK IS THIS"

2015-10-29 12:53:19	@logiz	every time I see my phone ring I'm like, eh I'll call back tomorrow after my interview, maybe
2015-10-29 12:53:43	@logiz	the only person I talked to today was the recruiter that has been setting things up, he'll probably stop talking to me if I don't get this job, but he's been pretty legit so far
2015-10-29 12:54:11	@logiz	cause you know, his job is to get somebody a job so he gets money, so he's been like "if you need your resume printed out I'll meet you in front of the building"
2015-10-29 12:55:12	HappyMan	hell of a recruiter
2015-10-29 12:58:23	@logiz	HappyMan: some recruiters, the ones that actually do their job, are pretty cool cause I bounce ideas off them
2015-10-29 12:58:41	@logiz	some of them tell me how I should update my resume without being assholes about it
2015-10-29 12:59:12	@logiz	the one today was like "you gotta seem engaged, interested, we know you have a learning curve, but everybody else is on the same skill level as you so you have to want it, ask questions"
2015-10-29 12:59:15	@logiz	you know what they all say
2015-10-29 12:59:43	@logiz	so I said "yeah I was reading an article on dice abou tthe wrong questions to ask, so I know I shouldn't ask these, x, y, z, but do you have an idea for questions I can ask while seeming engaged"
2015-10-29 12:59:55	@logiz	"not off the top of my head, but I'll do some research today and send you a bunch of questions"
2015-10-29 13:00:31	@logiz	I was talking to somebody wednesday that blew my mind, said most recruiters don't place more than like 2 people a month, which, really fucking sucks imo
2015-10-29 13:00:52	@logiz	so I guess if you put in a little more effort and you place 4 people a month, you're getting double the salary of your peers
2015-10-29 13:02:14	icarusdekoe	question there is whats the return per placement...
2015-10-29 13:03:57	@logiz	icarusdekoe: ofc, that's my other problem, pays well, but since it's a contract I gotta pay recruiter tax
2015-10-29 13:04:03	@logiz	fulltime jobs the company pays for :(
2015-10-29 13:04:43	icarusdekoe	ick, not a huge fan of contract work.
2015-10-29 13:04:49	@logiz	but I honestly don't care, even if they took 20% of my hourly rate I'd still be making more than I ever imagined for a first job
2015-10-29 13:05:11	@logiz	so junior programming median pay in nyc is around 75k
2015-10-29 13:05:14	@logiz	I'd be making a lot more than that
2015-10-29 13:05:16	@logiz	lol
2015-10-29 13:05:34	@logiz	icarusdekoe: also I wouldn't have to use django or other bullshit

2015-10-29 13:09:13	arlion	logiz: so then, the interview went well?
2015-10-29 13:13:08	@logiz	arlion: the first part went well, the second part when poorly, I think the first interviewer must have said "he knows python well enough" but they know I don't really do datastructures well (but they probably think I know them less than I do)
2015-10-29 13:13:29	@logiz	they seemed to get pretty upset I never took a sql management course, and they were upset that I wasn't a master at datastructures
2015-10-29 13:14:18	@logiz	arlion: they are looking to hire somebody tomorrow, so I think they just want to get everybody in and make a decision without looking for somebody else, they understand there is a learning curve
2015-10-29 13:16:55	arlion	When will you know when you get the job?
2015-10-29 13:23:47	@logiz	arlion: probably tomorrow afternoon
2015-10-29 13:23:57	@logiz	either that or monday
2015-10-29 13:24:14	@logiz	I'm not sure how many people are interviewing for them, it's completely possible that if I do well tomorrow they'll hire me on the spot
2015-10-29 13:24:35	@logiz	arlion: also when I talked to the manager yesterday he was doing a project and multitasking taling to me, I felt so left out, but he was kind of nice doing it lol
2015-10-29 13:24:59	@logiz	I walked into his room and was like "I really enjoy that monitor setup"  two like 28" monitor dual screen that had a bit of an angle to them in a corner

2015-10-29 14:43:22	icarusdekoe	foreign keys also do two other things
2015-10-29 14:43:30	icarusdekoe	they are constrained to exist
2015-10-29 14:43:52	icarusdekoe	ie, you cant put a value in a foreign key column that doesnt exist in the referenced table
2015-10-29 14:44:16	icarusdekoe	and you can do things like cascade on delete or prevent deletion of keys that are relied on
2015-10-29 14:44:45	icarusdekoe	ex, emp has depid -> department. if you delete the department, cascade on delete deletes the employee
2015-10-29 14:45:00	icarusdekoe	otherwise, it might not let you delete the department
2015-10-29 14:45:12	icarusdekoe	or it might auto change the foreign key value to null

2015-10-29 18:07:41	@logiz	icarusdekoe: can you get a key from a value in a hashtable?
2015-10-29 18:08:05	icarusdekoe	uh... no...?
2015-10-29 18:08:06	@logiz	it seems like an obvious no ot me
2015-10-29 18:08:09	@logiz	okay now I'm pissed
2015-10-29 18:08:18	@logiz	icarusdekoe: I said you couldn't yesterday and they said "yes you can"
2015-10-29 18:08:31	@logiz	and I'm like "but what if you have 100 values of 1, you're not going to get a key from that"
2015-10-29 18:08:33	icarusdekoe	i mean... you can search for a value...
2015-10-29 18:08:36	@logiz	yeah
2015-10-29 18:08:40	icarusdekoe	and return associated keys...
2015-10-29 18:08:43	@logiz	but then that defeats the entire point
2015-10-29 18:08:46	icarusdekoe	but its not a 1 to 1 mapping
2015-10-29 18:08:48	icarusdekoe	yo.

2015-10-29 18:09:15	icarusdekoe	that i wrote on HASHMAPS!
2015-10-29 18:09:16	@logiz	icarusdekoe: watching a video, it says an array has random access, that's what I thought
2015-10-29 18:09:27	@logiz	that you just give it a slice and it grabs it
2015-10-29 18:09:34	@logiz	cause it's a memory location
2015-10-29 18:09:48	@logiz	they told me that arrays had to search through each block to get to something
2015-10-29 18:09:51	icarusdekoe	yes true arrays are random access because their indexed
2015-10-29 18:09:52	@logiz	and I was like "thta's a linked list?"
2015-10-29 18:10:01	icarusdekoe	in python what you think is an array is actually a list
2015-10-29 18:10:15	@logiz	yeah I mean I've known arrays since the day I was born
2015-10-29 18:10:16	icarusdekoe	python doesnt have actual arrays iirc
2015-10-29 18:10:26	@logiz	it does
2015-10-29 18:10:28	icarusdekoe	arrays are literally consecutive block of memory
2015-10-29 18:10:30	@logiz	import array :P
2015-10-29 18:10:35	@logiz	it uses ctypes iirc
2015-10-29 18:10:39	icarusdekoe	thats why you have to specify the size ahead of time

2015-10-29 18:11:08	@logiz	yeah or you can just keep on going through it and put things in differnt blocks of memory like a dummy
2015-10-29 18:11:23	icarusdekoe	yeah, thats called a buffer overflow...
2015-10-29 18:11:24	@logiz	what's it called in C,  "unknown results" or something
2015-10-29 18:11:33	icarusdekoe	segmentation fault
2015-10-29 18:11:46	@logiz	there's some phrase they say in like every C book that I laugh at, might just be "unexpected" or something
2015-10-29 18:12:04	@logiz	I love segfaults
2015-10-29 18:12:04	icarusdekoe	undefined behavior probably
2015-10-29 18:12:07	@logiz	yeah that's it
2015-10-29 18:12:23	icarusdekoe	basically its "you can do this, but theres no standard for what actually happens..."
2015-10-29 18:12:30	@logiz	yup
2015-10-29 18:12:56	@logiz	so yesterday when they were talking about arrays, I was like "are we still doing python?"  "no! we're doing low level, how do you get from one array item to another?"
2015-10-29 18:13:02	@logiz	add one to the pointer
2015-10-29 18:13:13	@logiz	NO
2015-10-29 18:13:20	icarusdekoe	or just 1 to the index...
2015-10-29 18:13:24	icarusdekoe	fun fact
2015-10-29 18:13:26	icarusdekoe	in c
2015-10-29 18:13:42	icarusdekoe	*(ptr+5) = ptr[5] = 5[ptr
2015-10-29 18:13:45	icarusdekoe	]
2015-10-29 18:14:11	@logiz	yeah just like the other ways to do everything that always confuses me when I start mixing them
2015-10-29 18:15:01	@logiz	icarusdekoe: now I'm mad that I was  getting yelled at that all values map to keys
2015-10-29 18:15:23	icarusdekoe	i mean... they do... but its not necessarily unique
2015-10-29 18:15:32	@logiz	well yeah
2015-10-29 18:15:34	icarusdekoe	nor is it a constant time operation
2015-10-29 18:15:47	icarusdekoe	unless you do some weird as double keying or something
2015-10-29 18:16:07	@logiz	not that I've written a hashtable, but I mean, the concept is pretty straight forward
2015-10-29 18:16:16	@logiz	figuring associative arrays, dictionaries, etc
2015-10-29 18:16:17	fewt	Hmm Google is interested again
2015-10-29 18:16:18	fewt	that's interesting
2015-10-29 18:16:38	icarusdekoe	yeah their all basically the same thing
2015-10-29 18:17:01	@logiz	icarusdekoe: so what should I use for a hashfunction?
2015-10-29 18:17:07	@logiz	figuring you wrote a smart boy paper on it
2015-10-29 18:17:31	icarusdekoe	i didnt write it, but i did use the research....
2015-10-29 18:17:37	icarusdekoe	my table used FNVHash
2015-10-29 18:17:52	icarusdekoe	its fast and provided good distribution for the use case
2015-10-29 18:18:07	icarusdekoe	superfasthash was faster, but had poor distribution
2015-10-29 18:19:09	@logiz	I'm gonna look up fnv cause good distribution seems more important to answering a question
2015-10-29 18:19:35	@logiz	than say, "I use this for my hash function, but the distribution sucks!" cause ofc the followup would be "how would you have a better distribution?"  
2015-10-29 18:19:43	@logiz	by not using strings as keys, lololol
2015-10-29 18:20:11	@logiz	Fowler-Noll-Vo is a non-cryptographic hash function created by Glenn Fowler, Landon Curt Noll, and Kiem-Phong Vo.

2015-10-29 18:21:17	icarusdekoe	they are designed to be slower
2015-10-29 18:21:33	icarusdekoe	like sha512crypt, blowfish, bcrypt
2015-10-29 18:22:08	icarusdekoe	since they operate on small data like passwords, the overhead isnt too noticable for 1 try
2015-10-29 18:22:27	icarusdekoe	but it makes brute forcing the hash to reverse it much more expenseive
2015-10-29 18:23:01	@logiz	hm, well I do know all those things, I guess I just considered them different than a hash function

2015-10-30 21:13:56	rat	logiz: Fuck me. Chicago just passed a $0.55 per ml tax on liquid nicotine products.
2015-10-30 21:14:06	rat	$0.55 per ml is higher than what people pay for the damn juice itself
2015-10-30 21:14:21	rat	AND the state wants to add $0.20 per ml on top of that
2015-10-30 21:18:29	rat	dimeshake: BTW... since I let Sweet Complexity steep, it became a top 5 flavor. So I ordered some more. Opened the bottle and sniffed it. Yep. Smells like ass. Steeping's really important for this one.
2015-10-30 21:18:55	dimeshake	rat: hah that is funny
2015-10-30 21:18:58	dimeshake	the steeping bit

2015-10-30 21:19:53	rat	Can you imagine a $0.75/ml tax? That's pretty much double the rate of the juices itself
2015-10-30 21:20:08	rat	Fucking idiots.
2015-10-30 21:20:36	rat	What I think will happen is all local shops will sell 0ml juices so they're non-nicotine products and sell nicotine separately, forcing people to mix their own bottles and strengths

2015-10-30 21:32:56	rat	if they have Mad Alchemist, see if you can sample it.
2015-10-30 21:33:02	@logiz	cheaper than the premiums, but the same price as all the other 30mls
2015-10-30 21:33:13	@logiz	mad alchemist is same company?
2015-10-30 21:33:22	rat	VapeWild is still hit or miss in some cases... Mad Alchemist is almost no miss at all

2015-11-04 21:36:27	dimeshake	logiz: deluge shouldn't have root privs to begin with. it'd be something that got in via deluge and somehow used a kernel exploit or something
2015-11-04 21:36:36	rbrennan	my deluge runs as its own user...
2015-11-04 21:36:45	dimeshake	^^ so you're at least halfway sane :)
2015-11-04 21:36:46	rbrennan	chkrootkit says there is likely an lkm
2015-11-04 21:36:53	dimeshake	lkm?
2015-11-04 21:36:58	logiz	kernel module?
2015-11-04 21:36:59	rbrennan	kernel rootkit
2015-11-04 21:37:06	rbrennan	loaded as a module
2015-11-04 21:37:17	dimeshake	root exploit somehow
2015-11-04 21:37:18	rbrennan	so, my logic was to just upgrade to fedora 23 and see what happens
2015-11-04 21:37:22	rbrennan	which I just started :P
2015-11-04 21:37:45	dimeshake	that would not give me the warm fuzzies, but fun experiment
2015-11-04 21:37:46	logiz	this is all nonsense to me, I don't know how any of this is possible
2015-11-04 21:38:13	dimeshake	logiz: get arbitrary code execution exploit through deluge (or something else). use arbitrary exec exploit to run kernel exploit, gain root privs
2015-11-04 21:38:23	dimeshake	result = essentially a root shell to do whatever you want
2015-11-04 21:38:23	rbrennan	dimeshake: all the important data is seperate from the OS and will be rendered inaccessible through the upgrade, so I'm pretty whatever about it
2015-11-04 21:39:05	rbrennan	I'm still pissed that I made a mistake that let someone in though
2015-11-04 21:39:44	dimeshake	rbrennan: you've ruled out someone actually jsut logging in with ssh yeah? :D
2015-11-04 21:40:14	rbrennan	dimeshake: yeah, I've run those logs :P
2015-11-04 21:40:27	rbrennan	there is one person with access to that machine, me.
2015-11-04 21:40:29	dimeshake	my favorite was an old-ass webserver running a client site that got compromised. they also replaced sshd with a version that would capture passwords, parse /home/*/.ssh/known_hosts and look for other boxes to infect
2015-11-04 21:40:33	dimeshake	that was a fucking fun weekend in 2006 or so
2015-11-04 21:40:55	rbrennan	I'm going to changing all my passwords now, and its going to be a real pain in the ass 
2015-11-04 21:41:04	dimeshake	lastpass the shit up for web passwords
2015-11-04 21:41:07	dimeshake	use keys
2015-11-04 21:41:10	dimeshake	for ssh
2015-11-04 21:41:11	rbrennan	(yes it had keybased auth, but I've typed passwords on that machine to jump to others)
2015-11-04 21:41:12	dimeshake	no excuses
2015-11-04 21:41:59	dimeshake	disallow pass auth entirely
2015-11-04 21:42:18	rbrennan	I'll have to do that, assuming it comes back online after the upgrade
2015-11-04 21:42:53	rbrennan	it was connecting back to a botnet
2015-11-04 21:43:09	logiz	dimeshake: yeah but I still don't know how the arbitrary execution works
2015-11-04 21:43:10	dimeshake	that is super fun
2015-11-04 21:43:12	rbrennan	what happened, essentially was it locked down everyport but 5 mutating ports
2015-11-04 21:43:21	rbrennan	and was connecting to some place in the netherhlands
2015-11-04 21:43:30	rbrennan	and a few linode boxes
2015-11-04 21:43:42	dimeshake	logiz: there are a shitload of examples out there. the key is almost always (in a web app) some unfiltered user input combined with shitty evaluation of templating
2015-11-04 21:44:29	logiz	dimeshake: yeah but it seems difficult to prevent that kind of stuff
2015-11-04 21:44:33	rbrennan	mhm!
2015-11-04 21:44:35	logiz	I spent too much time trying to learn about it
2015-11-04 21:44:50	logiz	but you figure with something like deluge they wouldn't be boneheads about it
2015-11-04 21:45:08	dimeshake	any app big enough will have a hole *somewhere*, honestly
2015-11-04 21:45:19	dimeshake	you just hope its caught by devs/users before it gets exploited
2015-11-04 21:45:23	rbrennan	logiz: deluge is a fucking python webserver, its bound to be vulnerable
2015-11-04 21:45:33	rbrennan	but I still dont' know that that was the ingress
2015-11-04 21:45:57	logiz	rbrennan: but python webservers aren't inherently more vulnerable than the others?
2015-11-04 21:46:21	logiz	unless you mean SimpleHTTPServer
2015-11-04 21:46:26	logiz	which if you're using that then you're just an idiot
2015-11-04 21:47:03	rbrennan	logiz: I don't know what deluge uses, but the fact that its written from scratch by a smaller project than say apache/nginx indicates greater likelihood that someone missed something
2015-11-04 21:47:23	rbrennan	also their focus isn't serving webpages, its torrenting
2015-11-04 21:47:49	logiz	it uses twisted
2015-11-04 21:48:08	rbrennan	huh
2015-11-04 21:48:12	gtmanfred	<3
2015-11-04 21:48:20	logiz	deluge uses twisted
2015-11-04 21:48:26	logiz	and it uses auth and ssl
2015-11-04 21:48:30	logiz	http://git.deluge-torrent.org/deluge/tree/deluge/ui/web/server.py
2015-11-04 21:48:31		[ http://is.gd/fZaJqC ]
2015-11-04 21:48:56	rbrennan	uh, mine definitely didn't have SSL :P
2015-11-04 21:49:03	rbrennan	meh
2015-11-04 21:49:24	logiz	this is definitely beautiful code
2015-11-04 21:53:07	notnamed	it has a local file upload though...
2015-11-04 21:53:11	notnamed	plex doesn't have local file upload
2015-11-04 21:54:01	notnamed	you didn't happen to have debug logging enabled, did you rbrennan?
2015-11-04 21:54:13	rbrennan	notnamed: dunno, machine is still down upgrading to f23
2015-11-04 21:54:38	rbrennan	we'll find out later :P
2015-11-04 21:54:51	notnamed	deluge logs all its uploads, but only with debug logging enabled
2015-11-04 21:55:40	notnamed	a skiddie would have left the file in the tempdir defined somewhere within twister. you might find something if you search your local filesystem for delugeweb-*
2015-11-04 21:55:57	notnamed	a rootkit that took even the minimal amount of effort would have immediately deleted itself, though.
2015-11-04 21:56:10	logiz	god this kid is asking me how to network with people at events
2015-11-04 21:56:11	logiz	"say hi"

2015-11-04 21:56:33	rbrennan	haha
2015-11-04 22:00:10	dimeshake	logiz: you have to teach him the secret handshake. reach out, cup the balls ever so slightly for plausible deniability, then a brief wink and continue
2015-11-04 22:04:56	logiz	dimeshake: haha
2015-11-04 22:05:25	logiz	so the thing is programming people irl aren't as weird as you'd expect, but some of them are pretty fucking weird
2015-11-04 22:05:38	rbrennan	its not a normal distribution of weirdness
2015-11-04 22:05:49	logiz	I get so pissed when people go "hurr durr I'm such a noobie, lulz, just learning, hoping to be good someday, but I'm noob, so I know nothing lollerskates on ice"
2015-11-04 22:05:58	rbrennan	logiz: punch those people
2015-11-04 22:06:05	rbrennan	remember that stupid girl who was in here like that?
2015-11-04 22:06:07	logiz	rbrennan: unfortunately it's the vast majority of people
2015-11-04 22:06:13	logiz	that are new
2015-11-04 22:06:21	logiz	I think the skill level culls social awkardness
2015-11-04 22:06:31	logiz	the more professional people are, well, preetty fucking normal
2015-11-04 22:06:42	rbrennan	mhm
2015-11-04 22:07:12	rbrennan	so cup the lollerskaters balls or breasts and walk away
2015-11-04 22:07:21	logiz	lol
2015-11-04 22:07:48	logiz	I get kind of annoyed when pretty girls are there and all these new people start flocking to them
2015-11-04 22:07:59	logiz	like Idc if people are flirting or whatever, but some people are just weird
2015-11-04 22:08:37	logiz	like, trust me dude, pretty smart girl that graduated from columbia and has a ph.d in comp sci, that's a 10/10, but that doesn't mean flock like ducks to bread crumbs
2015-11-04 22:09:07	logiz	idk people just don't have a conception of place and time
