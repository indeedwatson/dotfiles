2015-08-30 14:12:12	DukeCeph	i55 tl;dw?
2015-08-30 14:13:10	inddwtsn	do you know the team names and which are US?
2015-08-30 14:14:40	DukeCeph	tlr and froyo are us, right?
2015-08-30 14:16:00	inddwtsn	everyone expected Froyo (best USA team) to get to finals easy, but they lost against nR yesterday and nR got to grand finals. Today, Froyo vs Reason (the EU team everyone expected to dethrone Froyo), Reason lost and now the GF is froyo vs nR, and froyo just needs to win one more map i think
2015-08-30 14:16:11	inddwtsn	TLR is EU but they didn't do well
2015-08-30 14:16:20	inddwtsn	ascent was the other USA team and they lost against Reason yesterday
2015-08-30 14:16:42	DukeCeph	huh okay cool
2015-08-30 14:16:53	DukeCeph	how was the froyo-reason game?
2015-08-30 14:17:08	inddwtsn	very close, i recommend you watch it
2015-08-30 14:17:32	inddwtsn	there were some great games yesterday
2015-08-30 14:18:00	inddwtsn	i missed TLR vs froyo and that was very good apparently, I'll catch up on that later
2015-08-30 14:18:00	DukeCeph	sweeeet
2015-08-30 14:18:44	inddwtsn	also flippy is best sniper
2015-08-30 14:19:33	inddwtsn	and b4nny switched from scout to soldier, and has been top damaging
2015-08-30 14:30:57	DukeCeph	top damage as solly holy bananas
2015-08-30 14:31:15	DukeCeph	also what how long has been running scooty booty man, isn't demo his jam?
2015-08-30 14:32:04	inddwtsn	he went scout for like 2 years
2015-08-30 14:32:19	DukeCeph	shiny
2015-08-30 14:32:23	inddwtsn	after losing i49
2015-08-30 14:32:43	inddwtsn	so he's pretty much the best tf2 player in the world
2015-08-30 14:41:37	DukeCeph	got the ego to match tho tbh
2015-08-30 14:46:35	inddwtsn	they became their regular froyo selves in the end
